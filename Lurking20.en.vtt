00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.240
(Song Qian, why is it you?)

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:45.640
Song Qian, wake up.

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:49.600
(You can't die.)

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:52.119
(I still have so much to ask you.)

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.399
Wake up quickly.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.000
Song Qian?

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:07.400
Song Qian.

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:10.799
Why did you save me?

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.439
Aren't you with them?

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.439
Speak up.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.400
Tell me, why did you save me?

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:22.799
Search! They can't have gone far.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.840
Luckily, it's just a graze.

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:54.079
I'll apply medicine

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.400
and bandage it. You'll be fine.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.920
So I escaped another danger.

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:03.159
Don't worry.

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:04.519
With me here,

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.480
you're not going to die.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.560
You owe me a lot of explanations.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.280
The dinner you said is fish?

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.919
Yes.

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.120
Look at this place.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.400
What else can we eat?

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.199
We might have to stay the night here.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.000
Then why aren't you catching any?

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.479
I'm injured. I can't catch any.

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.639
Okay.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.400
I'll catch mine.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.840
Catch your own meal.

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:52.159
Are you sure I can catch fish here?

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.199
What are you laughing at?

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:03.639
Stop laughing.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.639
Stop it.

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:15.240
Don't laugh.

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:16.879
I'm not catching anymore.

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:23.840
Don't laugh.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.960
They're over there.

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:47.319
Go!

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.639
I...

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:09.960
Song Qian.

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.840
Let's go.

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:54.120
Don't worry. I won't let you die.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.720
Is it that important?

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.759
You're risking your life.

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:16.639
Yes, it is.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.040
It's more important than my life.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.439
(He's done many non-drug-dealer things.)

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.600
(He seems more like...)

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.816
(Officer Zhang Han)

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:37.399
(Officer Zhang Han?)

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.600
Song Qian,

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:43.439
where are you?

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:44.680
Are you okay?

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:47.079
Officer Zhang Han,

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:48.639
he's at home now.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.399
Are you Gu Nian?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.120
Officer Zhang Han.

00:06:00.413 --> 00:06:04.267
♪What is secretly stirring♪

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.360
Are you okay?

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.720
I'm fine.

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:10.839
Is he...?

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.439
It seems you've guessed.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.680
Three years ago,

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.319
(I sent him
to infiltrate the Wei family)

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:21.800
(to get close to Wei Qing)

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.688
(to find the chemist.)

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.639
(Later, the Wei family)

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.199
(sent him to Tai City
to deal with the Peng brothers.)

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:29.240
(He gathered intel
on Tai City's drug network.)

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:32.279
(Although he obtained
their criminal records,)

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.480
(he was severely injured.)

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:36.439
(Fortunately,)

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.120
(this mission earned him
the Wei family's trust.)

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.639
(He entered the inner circle.)

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.720
(What I didn't expect was)

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.120
(that during that mission,)

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:46.720
(he would meet you.)

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.439
I don't know what your relationship is,

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:53.879
but he risked exposure to save you.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.759
This shows he cares about you a lot.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.680
I want to know

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.439
why he was at the scene
of the dean's murder.

00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:05.319
(Actually, the dean, like your mom,)

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:06.759
(knew about the mezzanine.)

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.639
(And they both got the elevator card.)

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.199
(Song Qian found out)

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.720
(the Wei Group would send Zhao Yan
to kill the dean.)

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:16.120
(So we decided
to have Song Qian rescue him.)

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.000
(But unexpectedly,
when the dean was fighting Zhao Yan,)

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.959
(he had a heart attack.)

00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:20.399
Dean?

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.800
- (Song Qian was a step too late.)
- Dean?

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.360
Dean, it's me, Nian.

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:27.399
(Maybe it's fate.)

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:29.800
(I didn't expect you would meet again.)

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.759
What about Zhao Yan?

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.000
Zhao Yan feared ending up
like the Peng brothers,

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.480
(and vanished with the card.)

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.680
(But he was hunted by the chemist.)

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.399
(Later, the elevator card
ended up with you by mistake,)

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.399
which exposed the chemist's identity.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.319
The chemist is Zhou Shen.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.279
This is the most critical moment
for Song Qian's mission.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.279
We can't afford any risk.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.639
You can't appear in public for now.

00:08:01.279 --> 00:08:02.720
His mission is too dangerous.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.079
Miss Gu,

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.839
he's not right for you.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.399
I'll send someone for him.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.879
I hope you won't see each other again.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.120
(His mission is too dangerous.)

00:08:19.519 --> 00:08:21.959
(Miss Gu, he's not right for you.)

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.759
(I hope you won't see each other again.)

00:08:47.919 --> 00:08:48.799
Gu Nian,

00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:50.679
why are you here?

00:08:55.399 --> 00:08:56.639
You're burning.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.080
You have a fever.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.679
I'm fine. You should go.

00:09:22.919 --> 00:09:23.840
Why aren't you leaving?

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:24.799
I'm not leaving.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.200
I don't want it to end like in Tai City,

00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:30.799
where we ended without saying anything.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.559
Song Qian,

00:09:34.159 --> 00:09:35.759
can we just not think about the future

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.000
or tomorrow?

00:09:41.159 --> 00:09:42.440
Let's just focus on now.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:45.879
Okay?

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.919
Do you truly want me to go?

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:10.679
If I go,

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.679
you'll regret it.

00:10:14.879 --> 00:10:15.440
Gu Nian,

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.919
being with me is dangerous.

00:10:20.639 --> 00:10:21.679
I'm afraid I'll lose you.

00:10:21.679 --> 00:10:22.679
I'm not afraid.

00:10:25.039 --> 00:10:26.440
Because you're here with me.

00:10:31.679 --> 00:10:32.720
Stop pushing me away.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.000
Okay?
