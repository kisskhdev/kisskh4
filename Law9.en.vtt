AND PLACES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

Aren't you getting up?

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.147
I'm off today.

If You Ask What My Dream Is

00:02:22.184 --> 00:02:28.315
BEST FOODS FOR PREGNANCY
SECOND AND THIRD TRIMESTER

00:02:29.024 --> 00:02:31.818
- I'll get you some soup.
- It's fine. I'll just eat this.

00:02:31.902 --> 00:02:34.946
They say it's better
to eat warm food. Hold on.

00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:55.676
What's all that?

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:58.637
They're gifts from the nurses.

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:00.472
Should we take a look?

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:03.767
Let's see. This is…

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:07.521
Baby clothes. They're so cute.

00:03:08.397 --> 00:03:10.273
This is…

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:12.567
Moisturizer and stretch mark cream.

00:03:13.652 --> 00:03:15.737
That's the fourth stretch mark cream now.

00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:17.781
Come on. The more, the better.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:19.658
You think I'll get stretch marks?

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:21.326
I might not.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.828
Everyone's different.

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:25.330
But you might.
Because everyone's different.

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:28.917
What's this?

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:33.922
They're so cute.

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:36.299
They say the first daughter
resembles the dad.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:38.051
- Yeah.
- She'll be super cute.

00:03:39.428 --> 00:03:40.429
Let's see.

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:45.350
Did you ask about maternity leave yet?

00:03:49.563 --> 00:03:50.981
Just wait a bit.

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:54.317
I'm not even sure if I can take
maternity leave in the first place.

00:03:55.277 --> 00:03:57.988
What? What company doesn't allow
maternity leave these days?

00:03:58.071 --> 00:03:59.948
I don't know. That's what they said.

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:02.367
Wait. So, what did you say?

00:04:03.285 --> 00:04:05.662
Did you just say okay and leave?

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:09.082
Then, what was I supposed to say?

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.960
Was I supposed to say, "I quit"?

00:04:13.462 --> 00:04:17.757
No, that's not what I meant.
Okay, don't get mad. The baby will hear.

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:19.718
When did I ever get mad?

00:04:27.184 --> 00:04:28.226
This is so annoying.

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:31.480
Munjeong, your breakfast…

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.575
How many cases
are you handling right now?

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:44.659
About 50.

00:04:44.743 --> 00:04:48.872
So what do we do? Do Attorney Ahn and I
each take 25? We already have 50 each.

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:51.833
Hiring a temp lawyer
for three or six months isn't easy.

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:54.669
You know clients hate it
when their attorneys keep changing.

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:55.962
But it's still my right.

00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:57.881
Yes, I know it is.

00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:24.866
What?

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:28.745
Use a new one.

00:05:36.962 --> 00:05:38.338
Here.

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:39.798
I picked it up.

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:00.068
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:07.075
ATTORNEY HA SANGGI

00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:19.462
Yes?

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:23.508
- Attorney Ha, you have a package.
- A package?

00:06:23.592 --> 00:06:26.177
It looks like the interns sent this.

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:28.179
I see. Okay, thank you.

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:38.523
<i>Attorney Ha Sanggi,</i>

00:06:38.607 --> 00:06:41.610
<i>thank you for being</i>
<i>such a great teacher to us.</i>

00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:44.112
<i>We'll keep learning</i>
<i>to become great lawyers.</i>

00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:45.614
<i>- From Park Dohyeon…</i>
<i>- Kim Hana.</i>

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:47.657
<i>- Gong Minjun.</i>
<i>- And Yu Haeyeon.</i>

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:18.980
This won't do today?

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:22.442
- I don't know why I'm so sensitive.
- We should've eaten something else.

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:24.069
It's okay. Go ahead.

00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:26.071
Hey, it must a boy.

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:27.238
My mom was the same.

00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:29.616
She said morning sickness
is worse with boys.

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:30.784
But it's a girl.

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:32.827
What? It's a girl?

00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:34.204
- Yeah.
- Congratulations!

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:35.955
- Thanks.
- What about maternity leave?

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.249
He said no.

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:42.921
I wonder what associates
in other firms do when they have babies.

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:44.339
I have no idea.

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:46.132
- I've always been by myself.
- Me too.

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:48.718
But your boss is a woman.

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:51.638
What did she do when she had her baby?

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:54.265
- She's not married.
- Really?

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:57.352
- How about yours?
- I'm not sure either.

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:03.274
Do you think a female boss
would be more understanding about it?

00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:05.860
It's so harsh though.
Of course, they should allow that.

00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:07.278
But you know how it is.

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:10.073
We're all small firms.
If one person's out, it makes a mess.

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:12.242
Still, at least you have Juhyeong.

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:13.910
- You two could work it out.
- Right.

00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:18.164
I'm okay with it,
so do what works for you.

00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:21.459
Hey, come work at our firm.
Our boss isn't like that.

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:23.169
Right?

00:08:23.253 --> 00:08:25.380
If a spot opens up,
tell her to hire me first.

00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:30.760
What's this?

00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:32.095
That? You know…

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:36.850
You didn't get one?

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.018
What is this?

00:08:39.102 --> 00:08:41.521
- Where did you get this?
- Never mind.

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:44.482
Never mind. It's nothing.

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:45.650
- What?
- What?

00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:47.610
- It's nothing.
- Do you have a girlfriend?

00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:50.030
- This is delicious.
- Why are your ears so red?

00:08:50.113 --> 00:08:51.197
Come, now!

00:08:55.493 --> 00:08:57.537
- Did you have lunch?
- Yes, I did.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.665
- Ms. Kang.
- Yes?

00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:04.669
If someone became pregnant here,
how would maternity leave work?

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:08.590
Are you getting married?

00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:12.260
No, I was just curious.

00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:14.387
You had me for a second.

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:19.017
Legally, I know what we're supposed to do.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.062
But in reality,
it's not easy to give maternity leave.

00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:23.980
There's only one associate, after all.

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:26.983
Right, that makes sense.

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:28.943
You're really not getting married?

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:30.904
No, I'm not.

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:34.449
Too bad.
I thought we had something to celebrate.

00:09:36.367 --> 00:09:37.494
Take care, ma'am.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.752
Attorney, Bae, I just sent you an email.

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:47.712
KoriTech's starting a new business

00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:50.381
and wants us to see
if there are any legal risks.

00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:52.926
- Could you write up a legal memo?
- Yes, sir.

00:09:55.637 --> 00:10:00.183
KORITECH'S NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVE REVIEW

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:07.232
Legal memos are so boring.

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:09.984
Where's Attorney Ahn? He's not here.

00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:12.195
I'm not sure. What's the matter?

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:14.447
Well, I had a lawsuit for him to take.

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:17.117
I'll do it.

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:21.496
The client said they couldn't step out
and asked us to come in person.

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:23.456
- And?
- You were concerned yesterday.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.835
Wouldn't advisory work
be easier on you than litigation now?

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:28.336
You just have to sit and write.

00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:36.803
- I'm being considerate of your pregnancy.
- No, I'll do it.

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:39.013
- Okay, then.
- Yes, sir.

00:10:56.739 --> 00:10:58.575
<i>Munjeong, can you come out for a second?</i>

00:11:04.455 --> 00:11:05.456
- Munjeong.
- Yeah?

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.625
You didn't eat earlier.
I got you some bread.

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:09.002
Hey, thanks.

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:11.796
And this is decaf coffee.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.132
- You're allowed to drink this, right?
- Yes.

00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:15.341
This is precious coffee.

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:21.931
Want to eat some <i>tteokbokki</i> with me later?

00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:40.116
- I can handle it.
- Thank goodness!

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.535
Gosh, I'm so thankful.

00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:49.459
This is really good,
especially this sauce.

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:51.544
They say this place is super famous.

00:11:57.091 --> 00:11:59.010
But not a lot of people are here today.

00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:00.511
That's why we're here.

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:05.266
Did you enjoy your food?

00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:10.647
I tried to patent this sauce before,
but it wasn't approved.

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:13.816
The review took a long time too.

00:12:15.777 --> 00:12:19.280
But in the end, they said
it wasn't unique enough to be patented.

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:22.116
Did that person work here for a long time?

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.953
He worked here
for a little over two years.

00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:27.330
- Excuse me!
- Coming!

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:29.457
<i>I originally hired him as a server.</i>

00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:34.254
<i>But from the start,</i>
<i>he was eager to learn kitchen work.</i>

00:12:35.004 --> 00:12:36.839
And a big spoonful…

00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:39.217
A big spoon…

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.594
Put it right over here.

00:12:44.013 --> 00:12:46.307
<i>So I moved him into the kitchen</i>

00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:49.102
<i>and even taught him</i>
<i>how to make our </i>tteokbokki<i>.</i>

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:53.982
Then out of nowhere,
he quit and opened a place just like ours.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.151
Did you go try their food?

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:00.738
I figured I'd get worked up
if I went myself,

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:03.574
so I had some takeout
that someone brought back.

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:05.451
It tastes exactly the same.

00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:10.873
That's why you think
you've lost customers?

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:12.667
After they opened,

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:15.586
our sales dropped by half.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.840
We always had a lot of regulars.

00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:22.010
Often, folks would come
from far away just to eat here.

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:24.971
But I guess their location's better.

00:13:26.055 --> 00:13:28.558
It seems people don't even bother
to come here now.

00:13:32.603 --> 00:13:34.939
JUST LIKE MOM MAKES

00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:37.108
INSTANT TTEOKBOKKI RESTAURANT

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:38.735
Thank you.

00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:44.907
The patent was rejected,

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:47.952
so he left and figured
he could just use it however he wanted.

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:49.620
That's so shameless.

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:53.583
Are you full?

00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:56.127
A little.

00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:58.004
Let's go another round.

00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:05.011
JUST LIKE MOM MAKES
OUR TTEOKBOKKI

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:12.143
- The sauce is so good.
- Can I get you anything?

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:14.854
Welcome!

00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:18.066
- Extra <i>ramyeon </i>noodles, please.

00:14:25.656 --> 00:14:27.158
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:31.913
It's honestly way too similar.

00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:34.916
At this point,
it's pretty much a second location.

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:39.128
Hey, that must be him.

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:41.839
- One more blood sausage here, please.
- Okay, sure.

00:14:58.231 --> 00:14:59.482
Can you handle it?

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:00.942
There's no reason I can't.

00:15:01.025 --> 00:15:03.152
- Because it tastes the same.
- Exactly.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.784
Give tips on using tableware.

00:15:09.867 --> 00:15:11.202
- Okay.
- Give them more kimchi.

00:15:11.285 --> 00:15:12.578
- All right.
- Okay.

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:20.962
- So, how's the food?
- Yes.

00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:23.673
Take all the photos you want
and spread the word.

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:25.883
All right. This is really good.

00:15:29.137 --> 00:15:30.138
I'm so full.

00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:34.016
But from what I know…

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.353
- Yeah?
- Recipe theft lawsuits almost never win.

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:40.439
Right. Plus, the patent wasn't approved.

00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:43.901
They'll obviously use that as an excuse
to say they did nothing wrong.

00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:47.822
Just because the patent was rejected
doesn't mean it's okay to steal.

00:15:47.905 --> 00:15:50.116
- Yeah.
- But how do you get approved?

00:15:53.202 --> 00:15:55.371
I can just ask everyone for the reason.

00:15:55.454 --> 00:15:57.456
Why were they rejected for patents?

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:01.878

32-1 SANSEOL-DONG, DONGDAEMUN-GU, SEOUL

00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:05.524
It's so upsetting.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:10.571
The ingredients in our pastry fillings are
totally different from the other shops.

00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:13.324
Ours have whole beans in them.

00:17:13.407 --> 00:17:15.785
That's what gives them
a stronger sweet flavor.

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:19.455
Our customers know that,
and that's why they come here.

00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:17.388
UNDER CCTV SURVEILLANCE

00:18:36.699 --> 00:18:39.994
- Ma'am.
- What brings you suddenly here?

00:18:40.077 --> 00:18:42.163
Mind if I take another look
at your kitchen?

00:18:45.082 --> 00:18:50.254
This recipe isn't protected by a patent,
so there's no issue with using it.

00:18:51.005 --> 00:18:53.215
Even if a recipe isn't patented,

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:56.052
it can still be protected
if it qualifies as a trade secret.

00:18:56.135 --> 00:18:58.179
Could you pull up Exhibit 4, please?

00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:03.309
In most disputes over recipes,

00:19:03.392 --> 00:19:05.645
the parties who had them stolen
lost their suits,

00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:10.274
because the recipes weren't deemed
trade secrets under the law.

00:19:10.858 --> 00:19:14.445
It's because they didn't meet
the requirement of confidentiality.

00:19:14.528 --> 00:19:16.614
Could you pull up Exhibit 5, please?

00:19:17.865 --> 00:19:20.493
For a recipe to be recognized
as a trade secret,

00:19:20.576 --> 00:19:22.161
it has to be managed as one.

00:19:22.745 --> 00:19:25.956
But most restaurants
don't put any protections in place.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.376
But in the case of the plaintiff,
Jeong Hyeonju,

00:19:28.459 --> 00:19:31.253
she installed a separate door lock
on the sauce-mixing room

00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:35.841
and shared the code
only with select kitchen staff.

00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:39.512
The defendant, Oh Jeongwook,
was one of those staff members,

00:19:39.595 --> 00:19:41.514
which is how he learned of the recipe.

00:19:41.597 --> 00:19:45.017
That's why this recipe qualifies
as a trade secret under the law.

00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:48.521
Keeping it confidential doesn't allow
protections as a trade secret.

00:19:48.604 --> 00:19:51.857
It also has to meet the criteria
of secrecy and economic value.

00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:55.569
Secrecy is recognized
when it hasn't been disclosed anywhere,

00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:58.989
and it can't be known
without going through the plaintiff.

00:19:59.073 --> 00:20:02.618
With this level of control,
we can see that condition is clearly met.

00:20:03.285 --> 00:20:04.995
Yes, that appears to be the case.

00:20:05.079 --> 00:20:07.164
Still, there's no proven economic value.

00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:11.544
After the defendant opened his shop,
the plaintiff's revenue was cut in half.

00:20:11.627 --> 00:20:16.507
The defendant used this one recipe
to lure away the plaintiff's regulars.

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.719
That alone shows its economic value.

00:20:19.802 --> 00:20:21.470
That has not been proven.

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:25.182
Plaintiff's counsel,
please submit your supporting documents.

00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:26.308
Yes, Your Honor.

00:20:30.688 --> 00:20:33.023
- All right, good work.
- Thank you.

00:20:36.819 --> 00:20:38.654
By the way, Chairman.

00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:42.533
Remember Lee Dongsu from the first cohort?

00:20:44.785 --> 00:20:45.870
What is it now?

00:20:45.953 --> 00:20:48.998
He's been investing
in small business owners

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:52.001
but with terms heavily in his favor.

00:20:52.835 --> 00:20:54.378
When they push back later,

00:20:54.462 --> 00:20:57.548
he demands the full amount back
and threatens to sue.

00:20:57.631 --> 00:20:59.759
So he hasn't sued them yet, right?

00:20:59.842 --> 00:21:00.843
That's right.

00:21:07.349 --> 00:21:08.893
I'd like to meet them in person.

00:21:08.976 --> 00:21:10.644
- The victim?
- Yes.

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:12.688
Lee Dongsu too.

00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:14.398
ADVISOR KIM HYUNGMIN

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:20.362
When you opened the barbecue restaurant,
Lee Dongsu invested 100 million won,

00:21:20.446 --> 00:21:23.491
and you agreed to pay him
4 million won monthly in returns?

00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:27.578
Yes, I've been paying that
for over five years.

00:21:28.537 --> 00:21:31.415
No matter the profit or loss
from the restaurant?

00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:33.209
Yes.

00:21:35.169 --> 00:21:37.963
These terms are way too unfair.

00:21:38.589 --> 00:21:40.966
I've never seen
an investment like this before.

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:44.178
Things are tough lately,
so we missed a payment for the first time.

00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:47.932
And now, he's threatening to sue us
unless we return the full investment.

00:21:48.974 --> 00:21:50.142
If we break the contract,

00:21:50.226 --> 00:21:53.896
we have to return
the full amount immediately.

00:21:57.399 --> 00:22:00.236
Did he have any involvement
in running the restaurant?

00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:01.987
No, not at all.

00:22:04.782 --> 00:22:07.076
I know I have to return
the investment and I will.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.621
But is there any way
to delay when I have to?

00:22:11.205 --> 00:22:13.207
I'm at my limit. Please help me out.

00:22:15.084 --> 00:22:18.295
Okay, I'll try to find
the best possible solution.

00:22:20.548 --> 00:22:21.799
Thank you.

00:22:22.925 --> 00:22:24.844
What about the consultation fee?

00:22:25.636 --> 00:22:27.513
I'm not a lawyer.

00:22:27.596 --> 00:22:31.809
I know business and investing
pretty well, so I wanted to help.

00:22:31.892 --> 00:22:34.603
There's no consultation fee.
Don't worry about it.

00:22:35.437 --> 00:22:37.147
Thank you so much.

00:22:44.864 --> 00:22:46.824
One Italian BMT
on honey oat bread, please.

00:22:50.244 --> 00:22:51.996
Try what I ordered. It's good.

00:22:53.622 --> 00:22:55.624
- Okay.
- Make that two, please.

00:22:57.167 --> 00:22:59.003
No bell peppers, please.

00:23:01.463 --> 00:23:04.675
I'll have a footlong Egg Mayo
with the recommended toppings and sauces.

00:23:05.718 --> 00:23:08.262
I'll have the same.
And I'll have a cookie too.

00:23:13.767 --> 00:23:15.144
I'll have everything on it.

00:23:22.818 --> 00:23:25.195
- How is it? Isn't it good?
- Yes, it is.

00:23:25.946 --> 00:23:27.406
I like it best with avocados.

00:23:27.489 --> 00:23:28.908
Hey, Egg Mayo is the best.

00:23:29.783 --> 00:23:31.952
This is when lawsuits are so fun.

00:23:32.036 --> 00:23:34.538
It's when you blindside the other party

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.916
with something they didn't see coming.

00:23:36.999 --> 00:23:40.002
But still, submitting evidence the day of?
Isn't that a bit much?

00:23:40.085 --> 00:23:42.504
- That's what makes it fun.
- That's right.

00:23:42.588 --> 00:23:43.714
That's a skill too.

00:23:43.797 --> 00:23:45.215
- Yeah.
- Hey, Sanggi.

00:23:45.299 --> 00:23:48.510
Learn a thing or two, will you?
Stop pretending to be so noble.

00:23:48.594 --> 00:23:51.597
Hey, as long as
the theoretical foundation is sound,

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.973
you'll win every time, kid.

00:23:53.057 --> 00:23:56.143
Yes, Professor. I understand. Geez…

00:23:56.226 --> 00:23:58.479
Munjeong, you looked into things
so persistently.

00:23:59.021 --> 00:24:00.481
I should learn from you now,

00:24:00.564 --> 00:24:02.316
- not Juhyeong.
- Sure.

00:24:02.399 --> 00:24:03.984
I taught her all that.

00:24:04.068 --> 00:24:06.195
You can't help things you don't think of.

00:24:06.278 --> 00:24:09.156
But if something feels off,
you should check despite the hassle.

00:24:09.239 --> 00:24:12.493
I took that,
refined it further with more focus,

00:24:12.576 --> 00:24:14.161
and elevated it into persistence.

00:24:14.244 --> 00:24:15.245
How ungrateful.

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:20.292
Did Ms. Jeong send her sales records?

00:24:20.376 --> 00:24:23.796
Yeah, I already submitted how sales
were slashed in half as evidence.

00:24:23.879 --> 00:24:25.339
- Okay.
- It's over now.

00:24:27.508 --> 00:24:28.926
All right, then.

00:24:29.009 --> 00:24:32.012
Let's use this
to draft the written statement.

00:24:32.763 --> 00:24:33.889
Yes, ma'am.

00:24:42.523 --> 00:24:43.899
- Attorney Ha.
- Yes?

00:24:44.566 --> 00:24:45.734
Here.

00:24:49.655 --> 00:24:50.656
What's this?

00:24:50.739 --> 00:24:51.907
GWANGSEONG UNIVERSITY

00:24:51.991 --> 00:24:53.367
You went to Gwangseong, right?

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:55.411
They're documents for the PhD program.

00:24:58.330 --> 00:24:59.665
2025 FALL GRADUATE ADMISSIONS

00:24:59.748 --> 00:25:01.792
What? But why…

00:25:02.584 --> 00:25:05.587
Just in case,
you should apply for the PhD program.

00:25:06.088 --> 00:25:08.799
If you want to teach later on,
you'll need a doctorate.

00:25:10.718 --> 00:25:11.802
No, it's okay. I…

00:25:12.302 --> 00:25:13.554
I don't plan on doing that.

00:25:13.637 --> 00:25:15.180
There's no harm in getting it.

00:25:15.681 --> 00:25:19.018
You like debating and studying anyway.

00:25:19.768 --> 00:25:22.771
If you stay with the firm,
I can even help out.

00:25:24.023 --> 00:25:25.024
Think it over.

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:27.651
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

00:26:00.726 --> 00:26:02.436
Don't go through with that lawsuit.

00:26:04.813 --> 00:26:06.690
This is why you called me here?

00:26:07.941 --> 00:26:11.153
Even if you made
a nice investment deal that favors you,

00:26:11.236 --> 00:26:12.237
at this point,

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:15.491
it's better for both sides
to compromise and walk away.

00:26:15.574 --> 00:26:18.577
You didn't exactly run your business
with kid gloves either.

00:26:21.205 --> 00:26:23.207
I'm telling you this from experience.

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:25.292
In the end, business is about

00:26:25.375 --> 00:26:27.669
working with and treating people right.

00:26:27.753 --> 00:26:29.379
That will make you more successful.

00:26:29.463 --> 00:26:30.631
No, that's not it.

00:26:32.174 --> 00:26:34.927
Make good investments
and turn big profits.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:36.178
That's how you succeed.

00:26:37.638 --> 00:26:39.264
What right do you have to do this?

00:26:39.348 --> 00:26:42.017
It's not about the right.
It's about responsibility.

00:26:42.101 --> 00:26:44.603
You weren't like this
when I first met you.

00:26:45.229 --> 00:26:47.147
How long are you going to live like this?

00:26:47.231 --> 00:26:49.233
What does it matter to you how I live?

00:26:56.281 --> 00:26:59.743
Just assign a lawyer as usual.
Don't suddenly act like you care.

00:27:07.334 --> 00:27:09.711
Yes, all the past investment contracts.

00:27:10.337 --> 00:27:11.338
Yes.

00:27:11.922 --> 00:27:13.173
Bring whatever you find.

00:27:13.799 --> 00:27:14.883
Okay, thank you.

00:27:19.721 --> 00:27:22.933
LAW GROUP HYUNGMIN
ADVISOR KIM HYUNGMIN

00:27:27.604 --> 00:27:29.439
SUPREME COURT RULING
DEPOSIT REFUND

00:27:32.609 --> 00:27:33.610
Yes?

00:27:35.946 --> 00:27:37.531
Attorney Ha, are you busy?

00:27:37.614 --> 00:27:39.449
Ms. Kim, what brings you here?

00:27:39.533 --> 00:27:40.659
Well…

00:27:40.742 --> 00:27:42.911
I came to get your advice on something.

00:27:42.995 --> 00:27:44.246
Do you have a minute?

00:27:45.706 --> 00:27:47.291
I'm so sorry.

00:27:47.374 --> 00:27:49.960
I just got a last-minute
detention hearing.

00:27:50.043 --> 00:27:51.295
I can't help right now.

00:27:51.378 --> 00:27:54.298
- Okay, then. I'll ask someone else.
- Wait.

00:27:55.465 --> 00:27:59.386
Why don't you ask Attorney Ahn?
If he doesn't know, no one else will.

00:28:00.512 --> 00:28:01.680
Okay, I will.

00:28:01.763 --> 00:28:03.682
I'm sorry. I should be helping you.

00:28:03.765 --> 00:28:05.934
Really, it's fine.

00:28:09.146 --> 00:28:10.397
By the way,

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.441
are you going to apply
for the PhD program?

00:28:12.524 --> 00:28:15.068
This? No, it's nothing!

00:28:15.152 --> 00:28:17.654
My boss handed it to me,
and I only glanced at it.

00:28:17.738 --> 00:28:19.781
I say go for it.
I'm very much for it.

00:28:19.865 --> 00:28:21.116
It would suit you so well.

00:28:21.199 --> 00:28:22.826
- Give it a shot.
- No, it's okay.

00:28:23.368 --> 00:28:26.496
What do you mean "no"?
Professor, you got this!

00:28:38.467 --> 00:28:41.428
We can't lean on Article 104
of the Civil Code, can we?

00:28:42.095 --> 00:28:44.932
Claiming the contract is void
because one party exploited

00:28:45.015 --> 00:28:48.393
the other's urgent circumstances
or lack of experience?

00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:52.606
I don't think Article 104
would apply here.

00:28:53.315 --> 00:28:55.025
Courts hardly ever recognize it.

00:28:55.108 --> 00:28:58.403
Making an investment contract
with a principal refund isn't illegal.

00:28:59.529 --> 00:29:02.240
I've been combing through it
and hoping for a solution,

00:29:02.783 --> 00:29:03.992
but nothing seems to work.

00:29:07.329 --> 00:29:09.748
I think this will be simpler
than you think.

00:29:10.832 --> 00:29:11.833
How?

00:29:12.417 --> 00:29:14.419
It says "investment contract" at the top.

00:29:14.503 --> 00:29:16.672
But just ignore the word "investment."

00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:19.716
It's an investment contract,
but ignore the word "investment"?

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.095
Yes. Focus only on what is
actually promised in the contract.

00:29:23.178 --> 00:29:25.847
It's just lending money
and collecting interest.

00:29:27.849 --> 00:29:29.267
So it's a loan?

00:29:29.351 --> 00:29:32.020
Yes. This isn't an investment contract.

00:29:32.104 --> 00:29:34.398
It's labeled as one,
but he loaned 100 million won

00:29:34.481 --> 00:29:36.066
and took 4 million a month.

00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:40.195
So, if we treat this as a loan,

00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:44.866
we still need to repay what was borrowed
and give back the 100 million won.

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:48.078
If it's seen as a loan,
the Interest Limitation Act applies.

00:29:48.161 --> 00:29:51.415
So legally,
interest can't exceed 20% per year.

00:29:51.498 --> 00:29:53.667
Since he received
4 million monthly as interest,

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:55.252
that's way over that limit.

00:29:55.836 --> 00:30:00.549
Over five years, the extra interest alone
would cover the full principal and more.

00:30:01.508 --> 00:30:02.884
So actually,

00:30:02.968 --> 00:30:06.972
Ko Ilseop is now the one who needs
to get money from Lee Dongsu?

00:30:07.055 --> 00:30:09.891
Yes. It's not Lee Dongsu
who should be suing.

00:30:09.975 --> 00:30:13.937
It actually should be Ko Ilseop suing
and demanding the overpaid amount back.

00:30:18.108 --> 00:30:20.402
- Wow.
- Do you need help with anything else?

00:30:21.361 --> 00:30:23.655
No, this is more than enough.

00:30:33.623 --> 00:30:36.334
The plaintiff has submitted
their sales records.

00:30:36.835 --> 00:30:37.878
Defense counsel,

00:30:38.545 --> 00:30:39.880
do you have any response?

00:30:41.882 --> 00:30:45.761
Plaintiff's counsel claims all criteria
for a trade secret have been met.

00:30:45.844 --> 00:30:49.056
But the condition of secrecy,
where the recipe isn't disclosed anywhere

00:30:49.139 --> 00:30:52.476
and is only known through the plaintiff,
has not been satisfied.

00:30:53.143 --> 00:30:55.312
As I mentioned last time,

00:30:55.395 --> 00:30:57.439
that was kept under lock and key--

00:30:57.522 --> 00:31:00.275
Could you pull up Exhibit 5, please?

00:31:01.735 --> 00:31:03.445
This is the patent publication.

00:31:03.528 --> 00:31:06.239
The plaintiff applied for a patent
but was rejected.

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:08.325
However, after 18 months,

00:31:08.408 --> 00:31:11.828
the details of the patent application
become public.

00:31:11.912 --> 00:31:16.249
So the plaintiff's recipe is no longer
a secret that is hidden from the public.

00:31:17.334 --> 00:31:20.670
I tried to patent this sauce before,

00:31:21.755 --> 00:31:23.090
but it wasn't approved.

00:31:23.715 --> 00:31:26.093
The review took a long time too.

00:31:26.176 --> 00:31:29.721
But in the end, they said
it wasn't unique enough to be patented.

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:31.431
You're right.

00:31:31.515 --> 00:31:34.518
That means the requirement
of secrecy is not met.

00:31:35.685 --> 00:31:38.647
Plaintiff, will you continue
to claim this as a trade secret?

00:31:39.356 --> 00:31:40.649
We'll review it, Your Honor.

00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:45.362
The plaintiff's recipe wasn't novel enough
to be approved as a patent.

00:31:45.445 --> 00:31:48.573
Not only could it be easily learned
by anyone working there,

00:31:48.657 --> 00:31:51.118
it's also been revealed,
so it's not a trade secret.

00:31:52.244 --> 00:31:54.704
Plaintiff, please review this
for a proper response.

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:58.834
If there's nothing else,
we'll end the trial at the next hearing.

00:31:58.917 --> 00:31:59.960
Yes, Your Honor.

00:32:15.183 --> 00:32:16.893
Is it okay to work this late?

00:32:16.977 --> 00:32:19.646
- It's fine. I can do it.
- Here.

00:32:20.689 --> 00:32:23.275
Jiseok said to look after you.
Why did you two fight?

00:32:24.568 --> 00:32:26.570
Do you two share
everything with each other?

00:32:27.195 --> 00:32:28.238
Need any help?

00:32:28.321 --> 00:32:30.198
- Let's do it fast and go.
- Yes. Please.

00:32:39.833 --> 00:32:42.377
JUST LIKE MOM MAKES
OUR TTEOKBOKKI

00:32:43.795 --> 00:32:46.089
Then, I guess the recipe
doesn't matter anymore.

00:32:46.173 --> 00:32:48.675
Yeah, it's all out in the open now.

00:32:49.885 --> 00:32:51.511
Is there really no way around this?

00:32:52.721 --> 00:32:54.306
What would you have done?

00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:57.184
I would've been pretty ticked off
if I lost all my customers

00:32:57.267 --> 00:32:58.643
and my sales were cut in half.

00:32:58.727 --> 00:33:00.145
I mean if you were a customer.

00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:01.980
You like good food.

00:33:02.772 --> 00:33:05.859
How would you feel if a place
identical to your regular spot opened?

00:33:07.861 --> 00:33:11.573
If I were a customer, I'd never go.
Loyalty matters.

00:33:11.656 --> 00:33:13.283
- You said they taste the same.
- Hey.

00:33:13.366 --> 00:33:16.286
If you're a regular somewhere,
it's not just about the taste.

00:33:16.369 --> 00:33:17.829
The owner's know-how,

00:33:17.913 --> 00:33:20.957
the familiar interior,
and the unique vibe the place has.

00:33:21.666 --> 00:33:23.627
Those kind of things put me at ease.

00:33:25.128 --> 00:33:26.630
What if all of that was the same?

00:33:33.178 --> 00:33:34.512
Yeah.

00:33:36.264 --> 00:33:37.390
Right?

00:33:38.808 --> 00:33:40.560
Hey, I…

00:33:40.644 --> 00:33:41.686
I have to go.

00:33:42.812 --> 00:33:43.897
Bye.

00:33:45.065 --> 00:33:48.902
Applying for the patent
has actually created an obstacle.

00:33:51.112 --> 00:33:52.405
You're right.

00:33:52.489 --> 00:33:56.493
I only applied for the patent
because I just wanted to say,

00:33:57.369 --> 00:33:59.371
"This taste was my creation,"

00:34:00.038 --> 00:34:02.290
and be recognized for it.

00:34:03.833 --> 00:34:07.045
But instead, it kept me
from getting that recognition.

00:34:08.922 --> 00:34:10.340
Do you think

00:34:11.091 --> 00:34:13.677
Oh Jeongwook knew
the patent had been rejected?

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.596
Yes. Not long after
he started working here,

00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:18.139
he suddenly asked me

00:34:18.223 --> 00:34:21.309
if I'd consider patenting the recipe
since it's too good not to.

00:34:21.893 --> 00:34:26.147
So I told him I'd already tried,
but it wasn't approved.

00:34:26.773 --> 00:34:29.567
He was checking
whether there was a patent or not.

00:34:31.611 --> 00:34:33.947
You're saying he asked on purpose?

00:34:35.573 --> 00:34:37.784
He was trying to steal
the recipe from the start?

00:34:38.368 --> 00:34:39.911
He didn't just steal the recipe.

00:34:39.995 --> 00:34:43.373
He stole your shop's vibe,
the interior design, and everything.

00:34:43.456 --> 00:34:45.834
It's pretty clear
he planned it from the start.

00:34:47.752 --> 00:34:50.297
You're right.
Even the interior designer asked me

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:52.299
if I was opening another location.

00:34:52.382 --> 00:34:54.467
Do you know his interior designer?

00:34:54.551 --> 00:34:56.469
He's a regular here.

00:34:57.262 --> 00:34:59.556
We've never really had a fancy interior.

00:34:59.639 --> 00:35:01.641
We just fix things when they break,

00:35:01.725 --> 00:35:04.978
and we'd always ask him for help
whenever we made small changes.

00:35:05.061 --> 00:35:08.648
I think Oh Jeongwook hired him
to design the interior for his place too.

00:35:10.734 --> 00:35:11.735
Geez.

00:35:12.569 --> 00:35:14.070
The recipe…

00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:18.033
and this shop…

00:35:20.744 --> 00:35:22.746
Over 20 years,

00:35:24.372 --> 00:35:25.540
I slowly built up

00:35:26.666 --> 00:35:28.460
everything here.

00:35:33.757 --> 00:35:35.467
From these chairs

00:35:37.052 --> 00:35:38.637
to those bowls…

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:41.264
For every single thing…

00:35:43.516 --> 00:35:44.643
I put in

00:35:45.518 --> 00:35:46.686
so much thought and care.

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:50.273
That's how I made this store.

00:35:52.275 --> 00:35:54.611
But people won't know that.

00:35:56.446 --> 00:36:00.241
Because the taste and atmosphere
are the same anyway.

00:36:09.417 --> 00:36:12.545
It used to be such a joy working here.

00:36:13.755 --> 00:36:15.715
But now, it's not.

00:36:16.424 --> 00:36:17.759
It makes me sad.

00:36:23.682 --> 00:36:26.601
Let's get that joy back.

00:36:31.731 --> 00:36:34.150
Could I get the number
of that interior designer?

00:36:37.987 --> 00:36:39.364
Are you heading out now?

00:36:39.447 --> 00:36:40.782
- Yeah. You too?
- Yeah.

00:36:43.535 --> 00:36:46.705
- What's that? Did you visit the school?
- No. It's nothing.

00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:51.126
It's just…

00:36:51.751 --> 00:36:55.004
My boss suddenly asked
if I'd be interested in a PhD program.

00:36:55.088 --> 00:36:56.715
She gave this to me out of nowhere.

00:36:56.798 --> 00:36:59.050
I see. Are you interested?

00:36:59.134 --> 00:37:00.343
Nope.

00:37:02.011 --> 00:37:05.932
People keep saying it would suit me
and that I should try it.

00:37:07.934 --> 00:37:11.521
But that's easier said than done.
It's not exactly cheap either.

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:15.942
Do you want to do it though?

00:37:18.862 --> 00:37:20.321
Yeah, I do.

00:37:22.699 --> 00:37:24.284
Nothing.

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:26.578
I want to do it.

00:37:30.957 --> 00:37:32.000
Let's go, Sanggi.

00:37:46.765 --> 00:37:48.183
Okay, thank you.

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:51.144
- Is it all set?
- Yes, Your Honor.

00:37:52.353 --> 00:37:54.230
You may start your presentation then.

00:37:55.106 --> 00:37:56.649
As you can see,

00:37:56.733 --> 00:38:01.154
the plaintiff's and defendant's dishes
look and taste identical.

00:38:03.072 --> 00:38:05.492
The style of the staff's uniforms…

00:38:19.547 --> 00:38:22.091
and the interior design
of the shops is the same too.

00:38:22.675 --> 00:38:25.929
Items with similar colors and designs
were used by coincidence.

00:38:26.012 --> 00:38:29.808
The parts of the interior that look alike
aren't unique to the plaintiff's shop.

00:38:29.891 --> 00:38:33.478
They're common, ordinary elements
you'll find in plenty of other places.

00:38:33.561 --> 00:38:36.356
Yes, exactly. That's the key point.

00:38:37.232 --> 00:38:38.858
As the defense previously claimed,

00:38:38.942 --> 00:38:43.154
the plaintiff's recipe isn't patented
or legally classified as a trade secret.

00:38:43.738 --> 00:38:45.490
The staff uniforms and interior design

00:38:45.573 --> 00:38:48.827
have an ordinary style
that doesn't appear to be that unique.

00:38:50.787 --> 00:38:53.206
This is part
of the interior design request

00:38:53.289 --> 00:38:56.501
made by the defendant
as he prepared to open his restaurant.

00:38:57.752 --> 00:38:59.587
And next to it,

00:38:59.671 --> 00:39:01.631
you'll see a photo
of the plaintiff's shop.

00:39:02.215 --> 00:39:04.008
The details in the defendant's request

00:39:04.092 --> 00:39:07.929
describe the exact interior
of the plaintiff's shop.

00:39:08.638 --> 00:39:11.850
If the interior was nothing special,
as the defense claims,

00:39:11.933 --> 00:39:15.186
then why did he go to such lengths
to have it replicated precisely?

00:39:22.944 --> 00:39:25.071
<i>I'm so happy a branch</i>
<i>opened near my place.</i>

00:39:25.154 --> 00:39:28.700
<i>The main shop was great,</i>
<i>and this location near my house is also…</i>

00:39:28.783 --> 00:39:30.702
<i>I hope more branches open.</i>

00:39:30.785 --> 00:39:33.788
The taste was refined over the years
through constant research.

00:39:33.872 --> 00:39:36.082
The know-how gained
from running the business

00:39:36.165 --> 00:39:39.460
is seen in the staff's attitude,
their uniforms, and the atmosphere.

00:39:39.544 --> 00:39:42.505
All of these elements
make up the plaintiff's shop,

00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:46.676
which is the product of the significant
investment and effort put into it.

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.971
The defendant became an employee
at the plaintiff's shop,

00:39:50.054 --> 00:39:51.306
learned that know-how,

00:39:51.389 --> 00:39:53.683
and even checked
the recipe's patent status.

00:39:54.267 --> 00:39:57.186
After the defendant confirmed
the patent had been rejected,

00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:59.939
he earned the plaintiff's trust,
obtained the recipe,

00:40:00.023 --> 00:40:03.318
and made his own shop look like
a branch location when he opened it.

00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:06.070
- Pure speculation.
- It doesn't matter when the defendant

00:40:06.154 --> 00:40:08.072
started planning his intentions.

00:40:08.156 --> 00:40:11.034
What's clear is
without the plaintiff's restaurant,

00:40:11.117 --> 00:40:13.661
the defendant's restaurant wouldn't exist.

00:40:15.997 --> 00:40:19.334
Not only was there unauthorized use
of the legacy and identity

00:40:19.417 --> 00:40:21.002
built by the plaintiff over years,

00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:24.088
the impression of a branch
was created to profit unfairly.

00:40:24.172 --> 00:40:26.466
Patent or not, trade secret or not,

00:40:26.549 --> 00:40:30.136
this clearly violates
the Unfair Competition Prevention Act.

00:40:31.137 --> 00:40:33.932
The defendant is liable for damages

00:40:34.015 --> 00:40:37.060
and must be prohibited from using
the recipe and running the shop.

00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:41.272
Okay.

00:40:42.023 --> 00:40:43.149
Defense counsel,

00:40:44.233 --> 00:40:45.944
do you have a response?

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.367
No, Your Honor.

00:40:55.662 --> 00:40:58.289
DEFENDANT, PLAINTIFF

00:41:35.868 --> 00:41:37.662
<i>You want to apply for the PhD program?</i>

00:41:37.745 --> 00:41:39.622
Yes, I thought I'd give it a shot.

00:41:40.623 --> 00:41:44.002
I came to ask
if you'd be willing to guide me.

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:48.464
Of course, I'd be happy to.
But why all of a sudden?

00:41:48.548 --> 00:41:50.133
You graduated a while ago.

00:41:51.718 --> 00:41:55.138
Well, I just wanted to study
a little bit more.

00:41:56.139 --> 00:42:00.393
If the opportunity arises later on,
I'd like to try teaching too.

00:42:01.436 --> 00:42:03.604
Do you want to become
a professor in the future?

00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:06.691
Yes. Not right away though.

00:42:06.774 --> 00:42:09.569
But I want to explore that path
while studying.

00:42:09.652 --> 00:42:11.029
If you start the PhD program,

00:42:11.112 --> 00:42:13.531
what about your current job?

00:42:13.614 --> 00:42:16.617
I plan to keep working.
I still have rent to pay.

00:42:18.077 --> 00:42:20.830
That's why I'm thinking of applying
to the evening program.

00:42:27.879 --> 00:42:29.380
LAW GROUP HYUNGMIN
HA SANGGI

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:36.262
If you just want to study more
and get your PhD, that's fine.

00:42:36.345 --> 00:42:39.682
But if you're aiming to be a professor,
that's a bit tricky.

00:42:42.852 --> 00:42:48.399
We give those who did their PhDs full-time
priority for teaching opportunities.

00:42:48.983 --> 00:42:52.695
We think it's fairer than offering them
to people who worked while studying.

00:42:53.362 --> 00:42:55.782
Right. That makes sense.

00:42:55.865 --> 00:42:59.410
Don't you have
any money saved from working?

00:43:00.703 --> 00:43:02.205
Yes, I do.

00:43:03.122 --> 00:43:05.625
Okay, Professor. Goodbye, sir.

00:43:14.133 --> 00:43:17.762
<i>If you're seriously considering</i>
<i>joining academia,</i>

00:43:17.845 --> 00:43:19.305
<i>think it through carefully.</i>

00:43:20.139 --> 00:43:23.976
<i>If not, studying while working</i>
<i>is totally fine too.</i>

SEOKGO BLOOD SAUSAGE SOUP

00:43:47.291 --> 00:43:48.334
Hi, ma'am.

00:43:49.085 --> 00:43:50.086
My mom…

00:43:50.169 --> 00:43:51.546
- What brings you here?
- Is she…

00:43:52.547 --> 00:43:55.216
Your mom wasn't feeling well,
so I swapped shifts with her.

00:43:56.551 --> 00:43:58.010
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:43:58.719 --> 00:43:59.762
She's sick?

00:43:59.846 --> 00:44:00.888
I see. Okay.

00:44:00.972 --> 00:44:02.014
Okay, bye.

00:44:06.394 --> 00:44:07.395
Mom.

00:44:10.064 --> 00:44:11.190
Is that you, Sanggi?

00:44:12.567 --> 00:44:15.194
What brings you here without any notice?

00:44:19.282 --> 00:44:20.533
Mom, are you sick?

00:44:20.616 --> 00:44:22.743
Sick? I'm not sick.

00:44:24.453 --> 00:44:28.166
My head was hurting a bit,
so I just took a day to rest.

00:44:28.749 --> 00:44:29.792
Your head hurts?

00:44:31.002 --> 00:44:32.128
Since when?

00:44:32.211 --> 00:44:34.297
That's just what happens
when you get older.

00:44:36.507 --> 00:44:38.509
When was your last checkup, Mom?

00:44:38.593 --> 00:44:39.594
Gosh.

00:44:40.511 --> 00:44:42.555
What if they say it's something serious?

00:44:42.638 --> 00:44:43.639
That's even scarier.

00:44:43.723 --> 00:44:46.684
If it's serious, get it treated.
What are you talking about?

00:44:47.768 --> 00:44:49.395
It's fine.

00:44:50.146 --> 00:44:51.606
It's just a headache.

00:44:51.689 --> 00:44:53.858
- I have money.
- I have money too.

00:44:53.941 --> 00:44:55.902
- Then, get checked!
- Gosh, be quiet.

00:44:57.987 --> 00:44:58.988
Forget it.

00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:10.917
I'll go buy some porridge.
Get some rest.

00:45:27.183 --> 00:45:28.851
JUST LIKE MOM MAKES
OUR TTEOKBOKKI

00:45:47.161 --> 00:45:49.956
- Attorney Bae, let's go.
- Okay.

00:45:51.582 --> 00:45:55.127
You've worked so hard.
Come and eat before you go.

00:45:55.211 --> 00:45:58.214
I appreciate it, but I should get going.

00:45:58.297 --> 00:46:00.841
That's such a shame though.

00:46:00.925 --> 00:46:01.968
My goodness.

00:46:02.051 --> 00:46:03.761
I'll make sure to visit next time.

00:46:04.428 --> 00:46:07.682
Lines will be forming again soon.
I better visit before then.

00:46:07.765 --> 00:46:11.352
No matter when you stop by,
there will always be a seat saved for you.

00:46:11.435 --> 00:46:14.063
- Thank you.
- Gosh. I'm the thankful one.

00:46:14.647 --> 00:46:17.483
Thanks to you,
I think I can work with joy again.

00:46:18.693 --> 00:46:19.694
Because I really do

00:46:20.403 --> 00:46:22.280
love my job.

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.201
Me too.

00:46:38.254 --> 00:46:40.381
Hey. You haven't had dinner yet, right?

00:46:40.464 --> 00:46:42.717
- Let's eat.
- What are these?

00:46:44.552 --> 00:46:48.389
I noticed your feet were swelling lately,
so I got a pair that's one size larger.

00:47:10.202 --> 00:47:11.203
They fit well.

00:47:16.042 --> 00:47:17.043
I'm sorry.

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:21.088
No, why are you sorry? I'm sorry.

00:47:24.091 --> 00:47:25.134
Hey…

00:47:27.011 --> 00:47:29.055
Can I think about it a little more?

00:47:30.473 --> 00:47:31.515
About what?

00:47:31.599 --> 00:47:33.934
I love this job so much.

00:47:39.982 --> 00:47:43.194
Litigation is just so much fun.

00:47:47.156 --> 00:47:48.866
I'm still not sure how things will go

00:47:49.867 --> 00:47:52.661
with childbirth or parenting.

00:47:55.915 --> 00:47:58.292
But for now,
I'll keep thinking about it as I work.

00:48:05.466 --> 00:48:06.467
Come here.

00:48:08.427 --> 00:48:09.637
My goodness.

00:48:10.179 --> 00:48:11.180
Munjeong.

00:48:13.599 --> 00:48:15.434
Think it over all you want.

00:48:16.352 --> 00:48:18.646
And do whatever feels right.

00:48:20.689 --> 00:48:23.359
I'll support you no matter what.

00:48:28.531 --> 00:48:29.657
Great job today.

00:48:45.339 --> 00:48:48.217
Why on earth are you showing here?
I'll just see you in court.

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:52.138
I came to tell you this.

00:48:53.681 --> 00:48:55.516
What you did to Ko Ilseop…

00:48:56.016 --> 00:48:57.977
You called it an investment,
but in reality,

00:48:58.060 --> 00:48:59.937
it's the same as a loan with interest.

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:03.482
How is it the same?
We clearly agreed it was an investment.

00:49:03.566 --> 00:49:05.693
Just calling it that doesn't make it one.

00:49:05.776 --> 00:49:07.194
Legally, it's a loan.

00:49:08.446 --> 00:49:10.197
You lend and invest money a lot too,

00:49:10.281 --> 00:49:12.450
so you know
what the Interest Limitation Act is.

00:49:13.117 --> 00:49:16.495
So in that case,
you won't get your money back from Mr. Ko.

00:49:16.579 --> 00:49:18.497
You'll owe him tens of thousands instead.

00:49:21.417 --> 00:49:22.877
Are you a lawyer now?

00:49:23.461 --> 00:49:26.755
It's pretty funny
to hear legal talk from you.

00:49:28.382 --> 00:49:30.593
Is having your own office
at the firm making you…

00:49:31.427 --> 00:49:32.428
a little confused?

00:49:35.389 --> 00:49:37.725
Straighten up
if you don't want to see me again.

00:49:38.726 --> 00:49:40.853
I won't give up
and I'll fight you to the end.

00:49:43.105 --> 00:49:45.274
Gosh, I'm so damn sick of you!

00:49:52.198 --> 00:49:54.575
- What do you want to eat?
- Chicken?

00:49:55.534 --> 00:49:57.786
- Sure.
- Hello, Ms. Kim.

00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:00.748
- You're still here?
- I should probably get going too.

00:50:01.749 --> 00:50:05.503
Thanks to you the other day,
that case worked out fine.

00:50:05.586 --> 00:50:07.630
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

00:50:07.713 --> 00:50:09.131
I only said a few words.

00:50:09.965 --> 00:50:11.926
Those few words saved a man's life.

00:50:12.843 --> 00:50:14.261
- Get home safe.
- Goodbye.

00:50:19.517 --> 00:50:22.770
- Did you help her with something?
- Just something simple.

00:50:24.522 --> 00:50:25.898
The restaurant from last time?

00:50:26.899 --> 00:50:29.985
No, let's have <i>gopchang</i>.
I'm suddenly craving something spicy.

00:50:30.069 --> 00:50:31.362
<i>Gopchang</i> all of a sudden?

00:50:31.445 --> 00:50:33.489
- You don't want it?
- No, it's okay.

00:50:35.449 --> 00:50:38.827
So no matter how long
or how much I deposit,

00:50:38.911 --> 00:50:41.914
I'll be able to get daily interest, right?

00:50:41.997 --> 00:50:43.207
Yes, that's right.

00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:45.543
Since you can deposit
and withdraw anytime,

00:50:45.626 --> 00:50:48.337
it's great for saving up
a large sum of money.

00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:49.463
I see.

00:50:50.923 --> 00:50:53.425
I just need flexibility with deposits.

00:50:53.509 --> 00:50:55.469
I won't need to spend for a while.

00:50:55.553 --> 00:50:58.806
Then, would you like me to help you open
the account you mentioned?

00:50:58.889 --> 00:51:01.058
Yes. Please transfer everything from here.

00:51:01.141 --> 00:51:02.434
All right, sir.

00:51:03.018 --> 00:51:04.311
Your account is all set.

00:51:04.395 --> 00:51:05.771
Is it all right to go now?

00:51:05.854 --> 00:51:07.606
- Just a second.
- Okay.

00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:09.275
Take these plushies with you.

00:51:12.695 --> 00:51:14.238
Okay.

00:51:32.298 --> 00:51:34.883
<i>I'm heading to prison now.</i>

00:51:34.967 --> 00:51:36.677
<i>I'll take responsibility.</i>

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.762
<i>Thank you, Attorney Cho.</i>

00:51:48.564 --> 00:51:50.232
Were you really upset last time?

00:51:51.525 --> 00:51:52.526
Well…

00:51:53.736 --> 00:51:55.821
I mean, lobster and ham…

00:51:55.904 --> 00:51:57.072
That's a big difference.

00:51:57.156 --> 00:51:58.240
But it's okay.

00:51:58.866 --> 00:52:00.701
That's not what I meant.

00:52:00.784 --> 00:52:03.662
I was talking about
how I'd only given cases to others.

00:52:05.039 --> 00:52:06.040
I see.

00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:12.755
I reached out because there's a case
I'd like you to take.

00:52:12.838 --> 00:52:14.965
Goodness. Sounds good.

00:52:16.216 --> 00:52:17.343
It's about time.

00:52:18.802 --> 00:52:21.138
We'll take anything.
Attorney Cho's a great worker.

00:52:21.221 --> 00:52:22.598
Yes, I'll be counting on you.

00:52:23.182 --> 00:52:24.308
What kind of case is it?

00:52:25.476 --> 00:52:26.810
An attempted murder case.

00:52:32.983 --> 00:52:34.318
Hey, come here.

00:52:34.401 --> 00:52:36.278
Where are you going, you punk? Come here.

00:52:36.362 --> 00:52:37.655
Hey!

00:52:38.781 --> 00:52:42.159
You little bastard. You thought
it was over when you transferred?

00:52:42.242 --> 00:52:44.662
You got me kicked out of school.
I have nowhere to go.

00:52:45.537 --> 00:52:46.872
So what now?

00:52:46.955 --> 00:52:48.207
What now?

00:52:50.084 --> 00:52:51.502
Damn it.

00:52:51.585 --> 00:52:55.089
My life is over because of you, punk.
Are you happy?

00:52:55.172 --> 00:52:56.632
So what now?

00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:10.771
Stab me.

00:53:11.355 --> 00:53:12.356
Go ahead.

00:53:12.898 --> 00:53:13.982
Do it.

00:53:14.066 --> 00:53:15.275
I said stab me.

00:53:15.943 --> 00:53:17.444
Stab me. Do it.

00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:35.671
Damn it.

00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:45.931
Chanyeong.

00:53:47.015 --> 00:53:48.726
Where did you get the knife?

00:53:50.436 --> 00:53:51.562
It was his.

00:53:53.605 --> 00:53:54.982
Did you take it from him?

00:53:57.484 --> 00:53:59.403
Does that even count
as taking it from him?

00:54:03.115 --> 00:54:04.158
Just…

00:54:05.075 --> 00:54:07.286
feel free to tell me
what happened that day.

00:54:11.415 --> 00:54:12.958
- Attorney Cho.
- Yes?

00:54:13.041 --> 00:54:15.294
Why haven't I been arrested though?

00:54:20.799 --> 00:54:24.428
The facts aren't that complicated,
but it's a bit messy.

00:54:24.511 --> 00:54:29.516
Well, we'll have to admit the charge
and push hard for leniency.

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:31.852
What? You're not going to try
for a not guilty?

00:54:31.935 --> 00:54:33.312
Like, completely innocent?

00:54:33.395 --> 00:54:34.563
- Yeah.
- That's a stretch.

00:54:34.646 --> 00:54:36.106
He stabbed someone after all.

00:54:41.153 --> 00:54:44.156
We have on records
that he transferred after being bullied.

00:54:44.239 --> 00:54:47.201
Considering all that,
we'll ask for a very lenient sentence.

00:54:47.284 --> 00:54:49.161
You could try arguing self-defense.

00:54:50.204 --> 00:54:51.330
Self-defense?

00:54:53.499 --> 00:54:54.791
You little bastard.

00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:58.212
You thought it was over
when you transferred?

00:54:58.295 --> 00:55:00.714
You got me kicked out of school.
I have nowhere to go.

00:55:01.465 --> 00:55:02.799
So what now?

00:55:02.883 --> 00:55:03.884
What now?

00:55:03.967 --> 00:55:06.178
The bully attacked,
so he acted in self-defense.

00:55:06.261 --> 00:55:07.596
It would definitely qualify.

00:55:07.679 --> 00:55:09.139
Isn't it a bit ambiguous though?

00:55:10.015 --> 00:55:11.433
So what now?

00:55:19.107 --> 00:55:21.485
<i>Once Chanyeong picked up</i>
<i>the dropped knife,</i>

00:55:21.568 --> 00:55:23.654
they'll obviously say
he subdued the attack.

00:55:23.737 --> 00:55:24.988
You know the precedents.

00:55:26.073 --> 00:55:28.575
Self-defense only applies
if the attack is ongoing.

00:55:28.659 --> 00:55:30.911
They'll say he stabbed him
after the attack ended.

00:55:30.994 --> 00:55:32.579
No, the attack didn't end.

00:55:32.663 --> 00:55:34.748
He even followed him to his new school.

00:55:34.831 --> 00:55:37.125
You can't say the attack
was just that one day.

00:55:37.209 --> 00:55:39.545
The bullying and attack was ongoing?

00:55:39.628 --> 00:55:41.713
It's worth trying.

00:55:41.797 --> 00:55:43.465
- He isn't in custody yet, right?
- No.

00:55:43.549 --> 00:55:45.509
Maybe they saw potential for self-defense.

00:55:45.592 --> 00:55:47.094
Forget it.

00:55:47.177 --> 00:55:48.971
It's better to get a reduced sentence.

00:55:49.054 --> 00:55:52.766
No matter what we argue,
they'll charge and rule however they want.

00:55:55.727 --> 00:55:56.853
What's with you?

00:55:58.272 --> 00:56:00.691
That court-appointed
voice phishing case I did.

00:56:01.233 --> 00:56:03.068
She ended up with a 10 million-won fine.

00:56:04.611 --> 00:56:06.113
- What?
- She couldn't pay the fine,

00:56:06.196 --> 00:56:07.948
so she went to prison today.

00:56:10.325 --> 00:56:13.245
If I'd pleaded for leniency
instead of claiming innocence,

00:56:14.329 --> 00:56:15.956
it would've cut a few million off.

00:56:16.999 --> 00:56:19.668
But I don't think
Ms. Kim gave you the case

00:56:19.751 --> 00:56:22.921
just to use extenuating circumstances
and reduce his sentence.

00:56:23.547 --> 00:56:26.341
It's a student from her foundation,
so she's more invested.

00:56:28.552 --> 00:56:30.262
Ms. Kim has a foundation?

00:56:30.345 --> 00:56:33.599
Juhyeong and Huiji mentioned it last time.
Didn't you hear anything?

00:56:33.682 --> 00:56:35.309
She really did seem to care a lot.

00:56:35.392 --> 00:56:36.393
Yeah.

00:56:36.852 --> 00:56:38.478
I'm sorry, but it's my case.

00:56:39.062 --> 00:56:42.316
I'm not going to risk a heavy sentence
after arguing innocence.

00:56:42.899 --> 00:56:43.942
If you want to help,

00:56:44.526 --> 00:56:46.111
help me get the sentence reduced.

00:56:52.909 --> 00:56:54.745
DAD

00:56:58.457 --> 00:56:59.458
Hi, Dad.

00:57:04.504 --> 00:57:05.797
Come and work for me now.

00:57:07.341 --> 00:57:08.467
What?

00:57:09.009 --> 00:57:10.927
You've done enough as a lawyer.

00:57:12.012 --> 00:57:13.722
Since when was there a time limit?

00:57:14.348 --> 00:57:15.932
You didn't have any big ambitions.

00:57:17.184 --> 00:57:18.977
Was there a reason you became a lawyer?

00:57:19.061 --> 00:57:21.021
You just kept studying
and ended up as one.

00:57:22.105 --> 00:57:24.816
You used to always tell me
to become Hanguk Group's counsel.

00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:26.943
That has a purpose and a reason, okay?

00:57:28.612 --> 00:57:30.280
I'm doing fine on my own.

00:57:30.781 --> 00:57:31.782
Don't worry about me.

00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:34.951
Then, tell me.

00:57:35.035 --> 00:57:37.245
Is there a reason for you
to keep doing this?

00:57:39.873 --> 00:57:43.251
Exactly. So stop living like that
and help with the family business.

00:57:43.335 --> 00:57:45.253
You remember you're an only child, right?

00:57:45.337 --> 00:57:47.547
Geez, again with the only child stuff…

00:57:47.631 --> 00:57:50.467
Join the company.
I don't want to work forever either.

00:58:04.815 --> 00:58:07.651
Isn't this is a good spot
to be alone and enjoy solitude?

00:58:08.527 --> 00:58:09.778
Hello, Ms. Kim.

00:58:11.613 --> 00:58:13.782
How's Chanyeong's case going?

00:58:17.452 --> 00:58:19.371
We're still reviewing it.

00:58:20.997 --> 00:58:24.292
But admitting guilt and explaining
the circumstances may be our best bet.

00:58:25.961 --> 00:58:27.045
I see.

00:58:27.921 --> 00:58:29.798
Then, I guess there's no other way.

00:58:35.262 --> 00:58:36.304
By the way,

00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:38.181
is something on your mind?

00:58:38.265 --> 00:58:39.349
It's nothing.

00:58:39.933 --> 00:58:42.686
- Could I sit down for a second?
- Have a seat.

00:58:49.276 --> 00:58:51.695
It's written all over your face though.

00:58:56.616 --> 00:58:57.701
Well, could I ask…

00:58:58.827 --> 00:58:59.911
How did you

00:59:00.537 --> 00:59:01.913
graduate from law school

00:59:02.414 --> 00:59:04.207
but end up doing business?

00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:12.215
I actually wanted to be a lawyer too.

00:59:15.469 --> 00:59:19.514
But I kept failing the bar exam,
so I found something else.

00:59:22.434 --> 00:59:25.312
Why did you want to be a lawyer
in the first place?

00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:28.565
Well, I don't know.

00:59:31.193 --> 00:59:33.278
I think I wanted to make a lot of money.

00:59:34.029 --> 00:59:36.072
I wanted to live comfortably,

00:59:36.656 --> 00:59:38.825
help people in tough situations,

00:59:38.909 --> 00:59:41.495
and maybe buy a building.

00:59:43.497 --> 00:59:44.581
You achieved it all.

00:59:45.457 --> 00:59:46.583
I guess so.

00:59:46.666 --> 00:59:48.502
I took a different path,

00:59:49.336 --> 00:59:50.670
but I achieved it all.

00:59:56.718 --> 00:59:57.844
By the way,

00:59:59.054 --> 01:00:00.555
if I ever start a business later,

01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:03.475
I'd appreciate some advice.

01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:09.981
Not for free though.

01:00:14.236 --> 01:00:15.362
Of course, anytime.

01:00:31.336 --> 01:00:33.672
POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER
CLINICAL DEPRESSION

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:45.642
BEHIND THE GYM AFTER SCHOOL

01:00:45.725 --> 01:00:46.726
DUMBASS

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:48.728
YOU RUNNING OFF SNIFFLING WAS SO FUNNY

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:50.146
CAN I POST YOUR CRYING VIDEO?

01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:51.648
CRAWLING ON ALL FOURS SUITS YOU

01:00:53.191 --> 01:00:59.072
CAREER GOALS
NONE

01:01:18.258 --> 01:01:19.301
What brings you here?

01:01:22.053 --> 01:01:23.138
Can you take a look?

01:01:28.143 --> 01:01:29.895
It started in his junior year.

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:32.564
Yeah, it's impressive
how he's held out this long.

01:01:33.106 --> 01:01:35.775
This should be enough
for mitigation, right?

01:01:37.068 --> 01:01:40.363
He's from Ms. Kim's foundation,
so he may be struggling financially too.

01:01:40.447 --> 01:01:42.574
Add that too.
It counts as a mitigating factor.

01:01:43.241 --> 01:01:44.284
Yeah, you're right.

01:01:46.578 --> 01:01:48.830
Since he's showing remorse,

01:01:48.914 --> 01:01:51.708
I better write an opinion
asking for leniency

01:01:51.791 --> 01:01:53.752
based on these materials.

01:01:55.003 --> 01:01:58.632
But shouldn't we ask him
if he's actually remorseful?

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:00.550
The rest are objective facts,

01:02:00.634 --> 01:02:03.178
so we can ask for leniency if we want.

01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:05.055
But you need to ask if he's remorseful.

01:02:05.639 --> 01:02:08.099
We can't just claim remorse for him.

01:02:12.687 --> 01:02:14.064
I'm not sorry.

01:02:17.484 --> 01:02:20.403
I get where you're coming from, Chanyeong.

01:02:20.487 --> 01:02:24.324
But if you say you're not remorseful,
the punishment could be much heavier.

01:02:26.284 --> 01:02:27.827
It's not because

01:02:28.954 --> 01:02:30.580
I think I did the right thing.

01:02:32.499 --> 01:02:33.833
I did do something bad

01:02:35.502 --> 01:02:36.795
with bad intentions.

01:02:38.254 --> 01:02:41.257
Okay. You admit you did wrong.

01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:44.469
If you say you regret it,
they'll reduce your sentence a lot.

01:02:47.847 --> 01:02:49.557
If I messed up, I should be punished.

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:52.727
If saying sorry erased the crime, then…

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:56.773
he could just say sorry and get off too.

01:03:02.278 --> 01:03:05.407
Why did you have those bad intentions?

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:08.952
Because…

01:03:12.372 --> 01:03:14.124
I couldn't keep living like that.

01:03:17.919 --> 01:03:20.505
<i>I even transferred schools</i>
<i>to get away from him,</i>

01:03:22.257 --> 01:03:23.883
<i>but he followed me there.</i>

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:31.016
<i>So I gave up.</i>

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:36.146
I decided to be bad like him.

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:44.738
You're not like him, Chanyeong.

01:03:48.408 --> 01:03:49.951
So don't give up.

01:04:01.421 --> 01:04:03.256
OPINION ON FACTS OF ALLEGED CRIME

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:17.145
FALLS UNDER SELF-DEFENSE…

01:04:29.949 --> 01:04:33.161
WEDNESDAY, APRIL 16TH
WAKE UP!

01:05:28.258 --> 01:05:33.263
ATTEMPTED MURDER
DEFENDANT MOON CHANYEONG

01:05:44.649 --> 01:05:45.775
Let's do our best today.

01:05:46.985 --> 01:05:47.986
Okay.

01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:51.656
SEOUL POLICE STATION

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:56.536
Because this could be my last case.

01:06:10.592 --> 01:06:17.557
Law and The City

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:54.385
Law and The City

01:06:54.969 --> 01:06:56.471
<i>My husband is dead.</i>

01:06:56.554 --> 01:06:58.473
<i>Our company isn't that overbearing.</i>

01:06:58.556 --> 01:07:00.225
This could be a problem.

01:07:00.308 --> 01:07:03.686
They're paying a much higher fee.
What can we do? We can't take both sides.

01:07:04.229 --> 01:07:06.147
<i>Who are you to turn down cases?</i>

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.358
<i>He isn't innocent though.</i>

01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:09.943
<i>I'll pay you a fat retainer.</i>

01:07:10.026 --> 01:07:11.861
<i>It was likely the right call as a boss.</i>

01:07:11.945 --> 01:07:14.614
At times like this,
just say I'm right and take my side.

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:16.115
<i>How is my wife?</i>

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:18.368
<i>It's so unfair.</i>

01:07:20.286 --> 01:07:22.538
<i>You were never bothered</i>
<i>by this kind of stuff.</i>

01:07:22.622 --> 01:07:24.165
What's different this time?

01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:33.591
