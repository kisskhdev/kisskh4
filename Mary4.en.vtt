-=This show involves the sensitive topic of euthanasia, which may be distressing to viewers. Additionally, characters,
events, locations, and groups depicted have no relation to reality. Children and animals were filmed safely.=-

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.770
Thank you for taking care of Soo-young in her final journey.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.120
I was just doing what was right.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.440
Was there really nothing going on between you and Representative Koo?

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.470
It was all my fault.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.690
I trusted that man too much.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.520
Never mind, as long as you came back safe.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.040
Take it off.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.440
Since we're making a deal,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.940
we should build trust first, right?

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.340
Isn't that correct?

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.490
Just take off your shirt; keep the bra on.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.570
Fine, if you're unwilling.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.420
This time, it's not a blank.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.070
Don't you need Bavlun?

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:43.340
Are you really going to walk away like this?

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.390
Come on, take it off.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.020
What's going on?

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.590
Why is it so clean?

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.170
You really don't do drugs, huh?

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.670
Satisfied now?

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.320
How could I be satisfied?

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.270
Take a commemorative photo.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.140
Say cheese.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.370
You two have my stuff

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.439
and are messing around with it.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.220
I'll give you a chance to explain later.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.920
Look forward to it.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.840
Are you sure?

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.440
Hyun-woo, have a drink too.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.870
Relax first before you talk.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.340
What you’re doing now

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.940
Stop it, that's crazy.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.590
What’s happened to you?

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.820
Does it not matter if you lie to achieve your goals?

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.990
Come clean and stop now.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.520
I never thought helping patients with consulting could become a crime.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.520
What you’re doing now is murder.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.469
How long do you think you can keep hiding?

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.540
As long as people like you are investigating me, I can keep evading.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.340
I will definitely catch you.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.370
You’ll never catch me.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.390
Because I haven't committed any crime.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.839
There are dissatisfied patients protesting about their treatment.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.290
Their attitude is quite intense.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:03.920
Please handle it quickly.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:05.590
Okay.

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:07.720
Stop.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.720
Bro.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.090
Oh dear.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:25.590
You’re still the same.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.140
Hey, Joo Soo-young.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.520
Did you arrive safely?

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.240
Did you meet Grandma?

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.670
Hey, I miss you so much.

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.790
Bro, why did you drink so much?

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.890
I drank too much because I miss you a lot.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.440
Stop making excuses.

00:06:46.441 --> 00:06:47.940
What excuse

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.170
Me

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.340
I really, really miss you...

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.420
Soo-young

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.320
Hye-jung too...

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.769
Get up, wake up, found a job

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:04.770
What the heck

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.470
Pavlon supplier Kim Shi-kyun

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.840
Tried smuggling at Incheon yesterday, captured by our unit

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.589
He was carrying a passport with Kim Shi-kyun's name

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:19.640
Could be an impersonator

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.290
Trying to pose as a big shot in that circle

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.120
Did you check the fingerprints?

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.420
Can't, fingerprints can't be confirmed

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.640
He destroyed them to hide his identity

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:31.275
Also, by eye inspection

00:07:31.276 --> 00:07:33.060
-=Confirmation Document Kim Shi-kyun=-
Age and appearance are very similar

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:37.920
Just like Kim Shi-kyun, he has a Virgin Mary tattoo on his right arm

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.519
The drug quantity he attempted to smuggle is enormous

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.440
Then no doubt it's him

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.170
He should be taken away by the special investigation team

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.190
Damn it

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.720
We need some time to interrogate him too

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.570
To uncover the connection between Choi Dae-hyun and Woo Soo-jung

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:55.870
That person is not Kim Shi-kyun

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.470
-What -Why How do you know? It's not examined yet

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.089
Kim Shi-kyun lost his front teeth and premolars due to drug use

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:02.330
-=Medical Record=-

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.290
But that person tried to bite his tongue to commit suicide, right?

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.090
That's because...

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.139
Hey, he's so rich, maybe he got false teeth recently.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.320
If that were the case, the teeth would have fallen out when his mouth was blocked.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.640
It's not this person.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.220
No, I prepared really hard. Where are you going?

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.990
I didn't expect Jo Hyun-Woo to be a cop because the medical records were very clear.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.240
Because those records indeed belonged to Jo Hyun-Woo's patient.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.120
He mentioned Baek Hyun-Seung when he contacted, saying he was introduced by him.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:38.370
The son of that councilor?

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.789
Turns out he's the link.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.040
That means he's aware of me too.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.490
If the police come to investigate,

00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:59.920
just say you've given him consultations.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.720
I prepared for such a situation by taking hospice care education and got certified for it.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.220
The police have already caught up.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.820
Destroy all the documents.

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:13.070
We'll stop operations temporarily, and also

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.570
go volunteer at the hospital I mentioned before.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:17.870
Alright.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.070
Go seize and search the Bon City Hospital.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.269
Still haven't found evidence related to Choi Gang-Yun.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:48.870
Get a search warrant using other charges.

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:55.520
Last month, in the case involving the representative of the construction company due to propofol dosage,

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.790
Doctors at Bon City Hospital said the records were lost.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.870
Go in under the pretext of violating medical law.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.420
Claim it's illegal medication use.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.440
Evidence related to Choi Gang-Yun,

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:11.670
go inside and find it for me.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.120
This group of idiots.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:37.470
Do-Kun.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.440
If you're so sleepy, just go rest in the duty room for a while.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.870
Even if I'm exhausted, I won't take a nap.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.440
At night, as soon as I switch beds,

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:47.990
I strangely can't sleep.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.389
I'm as sensitive as your looks.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:51.560
-=[Breaking News] International drug lord Kim captured=-
Seriously.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.540
The media thought it was Kim Shi-jin, causing a stir.

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:01.069
The police urgently arrested him at Incheon Port.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:05.020
The man in his forties, Kim Shi-jin, is known as one of Southeast Asia's top three drug lords.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.419
Kim controlled Cambodia's drug factories

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.445
and dominated the domestic distribution network.

00:11:09.446 --> 00:11:11.430
-=After mastering the distribution network, became drug king K...=-

00:11:11.431 --> 00:11:12.670
Swiftly became a bigshot in the drug world.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.820
The police indicated that Kim used multiple aliases

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:19.019
and frequently changed residences domestically
- =Aliases, frequent address changes...investigation chaos=-

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.440
The investigation faced numerous challenges.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:25.939
But the police received a decisive tip-off that Kim planned to flee overseas.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:27.989
He was urgently captured at Incheon Port.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:29.019
Slept soundly.

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.469
Kim was preparing to smuggle himself into China.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:34.119
Despite Kim's refusal to confess and exercising the right to remain silent, said the police,

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.270
Understandably, he hadn't slept for three days.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.620
-Let him lie down to sleep -Let's step outside.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.259
How would a bigshot like Kim Shi-jin

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.420
keep dealing with a doctor like Choi Da-hyun?

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.420
Even if they're prison mates, it makes sense?

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.740
Because Kim Shi-jin often went to jail for drugs.

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:01.240
No family visited him.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:03.340
No one gave him pocket money.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.340
But I heard during that time Choi Da-hyun

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:07.240
was especially kind to him.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.490
Being wealthy, he was generous to those around him.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.240
That's how he won people over.

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:17.840
After his release from prison, he received a lot of financial help from Choi Da-hyun.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.969
So when Kim Si-jin became a drug dealer,

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:23.090
he was repaying a favor.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.990
He thought he was bringing him drugs for his own enjoyment.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:30.090
Choi Da-hyun likely doesn't know that Kim Si-jin has become such a powerful drug lord.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:31.420
If he knew, he wouldn't have made deals with him.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:32.970
Because the chase would be much stricter.

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:49.319
The suspect earlier was caught

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.470
with a large amount of drugs while preparing to escape, right?

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.090
He assumed an identity for drug collection purposes.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:56.790
Let's check the purchasing list for Bavlon.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:59.270
That should lead us to Kim Si-jin, right?

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.190
You didn't purchase from the real Kim Si-jin, what will you do?

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.240
Bavlon isn't particularly popular.

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:06.840
Among the buyers,

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.470
there's bound to be someone who's dealt with Kim Si-jin before.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.709
If we carefully investigate the drug distribution personnel,

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:14.250
can we find other buyers?

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:21.460
Hello?

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:24.090
Deploy immediately.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:26.230
Go to Bonseong Hospital.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.010
The search and seizure warrant has been issued.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.490
-It hurts a lot. -Be gentle, please.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.500
It hurts so much.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:40.060
-=Emergency Center=-

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:48.780
Quiet
Do you need something?

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.430
You can't just enter the emergency room.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.650
We're from the Investigation Team.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.960
Due to violations of drug regulations, conducting a search and seizure

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.110
If you refuse

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.150
You might be charged with obstruction of justice and arrested

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.430
Let's begin

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.620
You can't just come in here

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.660
Wait until our hospital gets a lawyer before starting

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:06.340
Sure, go ahead

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:08.300
- Make the call - Okay

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.150
We are currently treating a patient here

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:14.300
Please be gentle, don't disrupt the treatment

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.860
Alright

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:15.910
Let's begin

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.120
Because that detective was right in front of us and missed it

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:33.440
He will definitely target us openly

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:35.400
What we are doing will be paused for a while

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.520
If there are any problematic drugs, throw them away

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.280
Understood

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:42.200
By the way, can we be together?

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.490
It's undeniable that we often meet

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:48.020
Even if we're careful, evidence might still appear

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:51.079
We need to come up with a reason for frequent meetings

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.080
Let's just start dating

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:53.040
No, I mean...

00:14:53.041 --> 00:14:54.910
Let's pretend we're... dating

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.680
Love so deeply it's hard to part, missing each other

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:58.090
That's why we're always together

00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.500
This way, there's no room for suspicion

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:06.209
We're at Father Yang's hospital

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:08.720
Reunited while doing volunteering activities

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:11.260
We've invited a resident doctor

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.450
His name is Dr. Choi Dae-hyun

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.210
Dr. Choi, may I ask what your baptismal name is?

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.179
He's not a believer

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.379
Then what is your specialty?

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.170
Emergency or internal medicine would be preferable

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:27.530
Plastic surgery

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.980
And I... I'm currently without a medical license

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:35.860
If you don't have a medical license

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.730
- Being a resident doctor might not be appropriate - Well

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:41.399
It won't be a problem in the future, right?

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.400
No, it won't

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:43.760
It won't be a problem

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:46.060
He's not a resident doctor

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:47.890
But a resident teacher

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:52.330
Caring for patients one by one while residing at the hospital

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.340
Exactly

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.700
A former doctor turned resident volunteer

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:58.000
That's good enough, isn't it?

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.540
I just don't have a medical license

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:03.320
I'm very good at caring for patients

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.899
But if he's wearing a lab coat

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.170
Saying he's just a volunteer seems a bit...

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.800
A bit inappropriate, right?

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.730
Take off the lab coat

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:14.460
Take it off

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:17.770
I only wore it because I felt a bit cold

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:21.390
Anyway, let's give him a round of applause to welcome him

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.070
It will be hard for us to contact each other in the future

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:26.069
If there's anything we need to share

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:28.660
We'll exchange messages volunteering at the priest's hospital

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.400
Alright

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:40.710
Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere else?

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:43.370
My shoulder and arm are both sore

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:44.380
Shoulder

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:45.910
Does it ache here?

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.930
Ow, you brat

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:52.630
I hurt too

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:54.700
-Are you okay? -It hurts a lot
I’m not okay

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.770
Besides, you'll see someone at the hospital

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.510
Nurse Choi Yi-na, who connects us with the patients

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:04.210
If evidence of drug trafficking is found

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.300
We'll say it's because of the patient violating drug control laws

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:08.930
After all, we have to deny the euthanasia issue

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.140
Yu-jung is asleep

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:25.630
-Honey -Hmm

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:30.199
No matter what others say

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.350
I think you're cute, I like you

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:35.390
Right?

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:37.719
Cuteness has no outlet

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.550
But only I can know your cuteness

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.500
Yeah

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.200
Why have you been so busy lately? Who have you been seeing?

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.030
Who else could it be?

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:56.810
Just my friends

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.300
Try meeting my brother more often

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:08.229
It's a family business after all, you're working too hard alone

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:10.860
You have to make an effort too, don't you?

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:11.920
Right

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:14.270
But

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:18.410
When your brother was assembling the gun, he pointed the muzzle at me

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.430
So I don't dare to approach him...

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.500
He aimed at you, but he didn't shoot.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.780
That's true.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.080
Just think of it as him being friendly to you.

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:31.280
If he fired...

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:32.790
After all, it is a gun.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.850
Stop hanging out with your troublemaking friends.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.110
Spend more time with my brother.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.040
Can you do that?

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:44.650
Yeah, alright.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:05.990
ABGA: Arterial blood gas analysis, PH level: acidity
BST: blood sugar test

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:02.980
The PH value of ABGA is 7.1.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:04.620
BST is over 500.

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:06.720
You can't treat diabetic ketoacidosis patients?

00:19:06.721 --> 00:19:12.430
D.K.A: Diabetic ketoacidosis, an acute complication of diabetes,
caused by insufficient insulin secretion Gastric cancer: stomach cancer

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:07.730
What's the issue?

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.660
The issue is that he's in stage 4 stomach cancer.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.800
But the patient refuses all other treatments.

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:13.860
Didn't I already get insulin?

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:16.180
I'll pay for this.

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:19.090
Stop stalling and let me go home.

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:23.850
For this patient...

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.220
You came to the hospital due to consciousness loss.

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:28.080
Diabetes might not be the core issue.

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:29.390
You need further exams.

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.000
I don't have money.

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.230
You won't check me for free.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.640
In your current state, passing out right after leaving the hospital...

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:37.610
Is not surprising.

00:19:37.611 --> 00:19:40.780
I'm in the late stage of stomach cancer.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:44.120
Even with treatment, he will die sooner or later.

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:47.859
You and I both know this, but why should I

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.110
It's a waste of money

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:01.430
I've already taken insulin.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.180
I will pay this money

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.209
The inspection fee is not as much as you think

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.440
You have enough money now.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:18.610
This money is all my assets

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:24.320
I want to leave this money to my children

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:28.079
Anyway, I have a terminal illness

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.610
And it can't be cured

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.790
Don't make me spend money

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:57.500
Prepare a voluntary discharge application

00:20:57.501 --> 00:21:00.920
DAMA: Application for Voluntary Discharge

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:58.760
OK

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:18.530
Let's go

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.400
Ms. Lee Yun-hee

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:32.950
Next time if you feel unwell again

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:34.730
You can go here to check it out

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.400
This is a hospital run by a priest
- =Maria Welfare Hospital=-

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:38.680
So it's free

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:40.670
Although I can't provide you with any great treatment

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:42.530
But it can help you in an emergency.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.360
You must be in pain.

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:51.710
Children will also be affected by seeing you in pain

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.790
Enduring it is not a solution

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.600
Even for the children

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.580
Check it out before you get shocked.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:03.510
Is it really free?

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:04.750
real

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.250
No fees will be charged under any circumstances

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:08.630
You can go without worry

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.360
Do you think helping others this way

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:51.710
will reduce your guilt?

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:55.720
It's okay

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.720
After all, you think I'm someone without guilt

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:20.740
Hmm

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:24.300
Has the Bafaloon for Dr. Choi arrived?

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:28.150
You've worked hard enough

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.410
There's not much left, just give it to him

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.849
Give whatever amount he asks for

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:36.910
Only a fool wouldn't sell it to him

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:40.950
Just give it

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:46.920
It's a pity

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:52.800
Kim Si-jin's biggest advantage is having no opinions of his own

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:54.220
I called him again

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:56.450
Don't accept anything from the police

00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:59.470
And don't give the Bafaloon to Dr. Choi

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:01.130
That guy is something else

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:03.529
Is he mimicking me

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:05.660
or acting

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.560
or does he really think this business is his own?

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.480
What to do?

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:21.000
It's been a tough time

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:23.730
Alright

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:35.820
The investigation results for Kim Si-jin's identity theft are out

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:42.180
The drug purchase channels have also been investigated

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.670
All those connected to him have been arrested

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.680
The drugs

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.610
Has it been confirmed where the Bafaloon was bought from?

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:49.390
Almost finished confirming

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.630
But no connection with Jin Shijian

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:56.570
Seems like pretending to collect a large amount of drugs

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:00.730
Except for what the authorities have confirmed

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:02.790
Is there any overlooked part in the testimonies

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:05.610
Such as excluded evidence due to lack of conclusiveness

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.200
There is one

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.480
Go ahead

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.800
A drug courier said the drugs came from there

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:14.700
There's something unnoticed

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.380
Most expensive penthouse in Gangnam

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:23.740
A longtime drug courier gave a testimony

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.670
But didn't agree due to privacy concerns

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:28.180
Also said they want a search warrant for a confiscation

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:30.760
So we couldn't get the footage from the disaster prevention room

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:32.540
It's a headache if we find nothing

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:33.550
So it was ignored

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:35.240
Anyway, the suspect has already been found

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:42.350
I put some effort into my appearance

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:43.380
Really pretty

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:45.100
Thank you

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.480
Thank you

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.760
You're so busy, yet you found time to come

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:52.620
I came during my lunch break

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.049
There's still someone who hasn't arrived

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:56.490
Okay, got it

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:58.890
Anyone else coming?

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:00.030
Yes

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:01.840
She just arrived

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.100
Here

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:07.460
Hello

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:09.750
I invited Sayan's aunt to come along too

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.139
After all, Sayan is a student leader at school

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:13.320
Isn't it strange if the student's parents don't attend the committee meeting?

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:15.860
-Hello -Hello

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.730
Who ordered the black bean sauce noodles?

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.430
The police

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:28.610
Hey

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.329
Does being a cop make you so great?

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:36.359
Why did you ride off on my e-bike?

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.260
Hey, you

00:26:37.261 --> 00:26:39.060
Why didn't you give me a ride? Seriously

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:40.910
Hey

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:42.980
Why did you stop delivering drugs?

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:46.029
I already said it's because of burnout

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:47.429
You, talking about burnout

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:49.560
Give a proper excuse

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:52.109
Someone earning billions every month from drug deliveries

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:54.210
Suddenly starts delivering black bean sauce noodles with a metal box?

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:55.929
Why were you kicked out?

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:57.909
Who was kicked out?

00:26:57.910 --> 00:26:58.910
Take your hand out of your pocket

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:03.510
I quit on my own

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:06.329
Every drug courier got caught

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:07.979
Who knows what might happen if I continued?

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.230
Your territory

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.960
Includes this penthouse too, right?

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:15.680
What happened there?

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.859
Nothing happened, no

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.159
Just rumors

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.110
-I'm going to deliver food now -You jerk

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.980
There was a delivery person who worked for a long time

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.429
That person went to the penthouse once

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:39.030
And said one sentence

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:40.810
Only that person was arrested

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:43.759
So who would dare to get involved there

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.010
-Only the delivery person was taken away -Which means

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:48.430
You have been there

00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:51.830
Oh...

00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:00.380
Is Yu-mei feeling better?

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:02.609
I saw her faint at the performance venue that day

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:04.810
I was really startled

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.010
She ate normally for a few days and is much better now

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.109
I heard Aunt Caiyan

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:13.810
Treated Yu-mei in the emergency room

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:16.930
What was her exact condition at that time?

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:19.559
Everyone is aware, right?

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:20.959
The reason was excessive dieting

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.510
Did she undergo all the tests?

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:23.560
No

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.760
There was no need for any tests

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:31.379
You seem to be suspicious if she accidentally ingested something

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.109
If she took drugs

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:36.260
Her pupils would definitely enlarge or shrink abnormally

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.459
But Yu-mei had no such symptoms at all

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:41.080
She recovered immediately when she got to the emergency room

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.009
Instead of doing unnecessary tests, wasting effort

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:45.779
I think letting her eat more is better

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:47.360
So we just sent her home

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:48.830
Because of dieting

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:51.010
She's practically malnourished.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.609
Oh my gosh.

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:55.329
There's still malnutrition in this day and age?

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:56.609
Exactly.

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:59.430
I had no idea she wasn't even eating the school meals.

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:17.259
If you can earn a billion,

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.379
what's the point of working for us and those diligent cleaners?

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:22.179
And what's the meaning of work anyway?

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:24.260
-I can't even make 400 a month -That

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:28.080
-What's wrong with Jihoon? -What?

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.380
Which room did you visit?

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:33.459
I'm asking which room you came to.

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.180
Hey, hey, hey.

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:37.809
-Who are you? -Stop the car.

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:39.260
-Hurry, pull him down -Stop the car.

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:40.710
Stop the car.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.680
-Hey -What's going on?

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:51.960
What are you doing, Jihoon?

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:57.910
What's wrong? Are you okay?

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.330
Someone seemed to leave here in a hurry today.

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:22.479
The police are tracking very closely.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.480
I've decided to change my residence.

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:28.410
Isn't that a bit too hasty?

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.480
There's hardly anywhere to eat or stay here.

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:36.180
You'll know once you get inside.

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:02.310
Ah, here you go.

00:31:02.311 --> 00:31:04.560
Wow, this is really expensive.

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:07.180
Alright, alright.

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:09.259
Thank you.

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:11.030
I can't believe we can drink such good wine.

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:14.609
I've been too busy since I arrived, so we haven't had a proper meal together.

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:18.480
So I prepared some old-aged wine.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.309
Thank you so much.

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:22.730
I'm already very grateful that you're willing to volunteer.

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:26.080
-Thank you for your hard work. -Okay.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.230
This taste really is a blessing.

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:42.159
I'll savor this bottle slowly, sparingly.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.359
No, Father.

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.260
You don't have to be so frugal with it.

00:31:44.261 --> 00:31:45.480
I'll bring you more frequently.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:46.760
No, no.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:50.780
Actually, I have to leave early tomorrow morning.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.679
Why stop enjoying this blessing?

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.410
Where are you going?

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:57.680
Well...

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:00.879
When I worked at the orphanage before,

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.660
I was in charge of a child.

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:06.680
Not long ago, he came here for volunteer work.

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:09.360
But suddenly,

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:11.480
he passed away.

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.560
So tomorrow,

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:16.980
I plan to attend his farewell.

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.410
Are you talking about Zhao Xianyu?

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.180
How does Doctor Choi know Xianyu?

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:28.710
Ah, because of Sujeong...

00:32:28.711 --> 00:32:31.460
Because of Dr. Woo, I've met him a few times.

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:33.310
Ah, I see.

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:36.980
What happened?

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:44.310
Mom.

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.680
Hello.

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:48.560
How could this happen

00:32:48.561 --> 00:32:50.080
- Uncle -Yes

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:52.830
Please save my mom

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:55.480
- Is she your mother? -Yes
- =Maria Welfare Hospital, Goyang District, Gowan City=-

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:58.230
A patient brought by Dr. Woo

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.609
Got it. Don't worry about your mom, she's fine.

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:02.710
I understand

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:04.859
I'll go call the nurse

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:05.860
Alright

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:07.779
It's okay, it's okay

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:09.260
Are you alright?

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:17.060
- Hello -Dr. Woo

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:21.110
A patient named Kim Jae-hoon was just brought in

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:25.080
But we probably need to contact the police first

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:26.930
Why do we need to contact the police?

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:28.180
He's a gunshot wound patient

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.260
It hurts

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:40.580
It really hurts

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.480
So painful

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:46.330
My heart hurts so much

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:49.380
- My heart hurts too much -I was scared by the news

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:52.060
I thought it was the arrest of Boss Kim who gave us poison
- =Poison King K, eventually found to be an impersonator...=-

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.236
Even with blurring, they still look similar
- =Police, "Similar appearance and tattoos to Poison King K" investigation faces difficulties=-

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:56.010
Even the Virgin Mary tattoo is the same

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:57.580
My heart

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:01.510
My heart hurts too much

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.630
My heart really hurts

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:14.880
No abnormalities in the heart

00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:17.209
It's a psychological illusion from the shock after the accident

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:18.329
Please take a deep breath

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:19.579
We need to check if there's any damage to the bones.

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:20.230
Go get the portable X-ray machine.
Okay, got it.

00:34:20.231 --> 00:34:22.969
Portable X-ray machine: A mobile X-ray penetrating device.
Then inject 5mg of painkiller and send to the examination room.

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:27.980
Examination room: Here, blood, urine, stool, [[BR]] body fluids and tissues can be tested to aid in disease diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and management.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.679
We're from Bonsung Police Station.

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:55.900
After mom receives the injection

00:34:55.929 --> 00:34:57.180
She will get better.

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:00.899
Your name is Komatsu, right?

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:02.050
Yes.

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:04.280
It's a lovely name.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.080
Thank you.

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:42.680
We're here.

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:45.880
Come.

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.400
This is my mom’s stroller.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.299
Oh, it's your mom's?

00:35:58.300 --> 00:35:59.300
Yes.

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:20.249
Let me help, uncle.

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:21.250
Alright.

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:23.929
What should we do first?

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:25.180
Let me see.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:39.700
Okay.

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:48.250
Uncle, you can push it.

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:50.379
Where do we need to push this?

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:52.880
To the parking lot of that building.

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:54.999
It's 50,000 Korean Won per month.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.880
The uncle there will help keep an eye on it.

00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:58.330
Really?

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Let's go.

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:32.049
I know you're working, but please step aside.

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:33.399
That patient has a gunshot wound.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.949
He can't escape in his condition, please let us through.

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:38.049
We need to conduct an investigation, when can we take him?

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:39.449
I don't know yet.

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:41.300
We need to do a check-up now, please leave.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:44.850
Come with me for a moment.

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:50.280
-=Medical Report=-

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:00.030
I'll ask you one more time.

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:02.100
What is your name?

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.749
Didn't I say it's Kim Jae-hoon?

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:08.149
Patient Kim Jae-hoon, due to a traffic accident,

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:10.280
underwent extensive surgery for a fractured right arm.

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.179
Using someone else's identity for hospital treatment is illegal.

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:14.730
The police will know soon.

00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:18.080
They will soon know who you are.

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:20.410
Who are you?

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.160
Hey.

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.229
Do your examination.

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:26.270
The examination is done.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.570
No remaining bullet fragments or bone injuries.

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.850
If the police take me now, I'll die.

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:36.400
I need to stay here a bit longer.

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:40.060
Even though the side wound is a penetration wound,

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.290
you can be discharged tomorrow.

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:49.610
Patient, please lie on your side, it's time for the injection.

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.930
Will it hurt?

00:38:50.931 --> 00:38:52.959
Yes, but not as much as a gunshot wound.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.100
Stop whining without reason.

00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:57.430
Come on, pull down your pants.

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.750
Pain will prevent you from going into shock.

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:16.240
To experts,

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:19.870
failure means going crazy.

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:23.240
Don't go crazy here.

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:27.430
Don't go crazy here.

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:29.920
And don't whine over nothing.

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:31.100
What are you doing?

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:50.630
Dr. Yoo
Hello.

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:53.070
They say a friend urgently needs to see you.

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:54.550
-A friend? -Yes.

00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:56.950
Hello
Yoo Soo-jin.

00:39:58.840 --> 00:39:59.610
Who is this?

00:39:59.611 --> 00:40:00.710
Who else could it be?

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:02.360
Pavalong.

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:06.300
Think of it now?

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.870
How did you know to call this number?

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:13.910
Jin Si-kyun is with you, right?

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:18.830
The gunshot victim is Jin Si-kyun.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.780
Did you do this to him?

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:23.839
Did you purposely send him to me?

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.319
Not on purpose.

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.449
Anyway, it happened at the place I recommended.

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:29.790
So you could say I caused it.

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:33.339
But he didn't die, he made it to you.

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:34.880
It's giving me a headache.

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:37.750
This is a hospital.

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:41.400
The police will soon know he's Jin Si-kyun.

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:42.500
That's right.

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:46.000
The police have already searched Jin Si-kyun's place.

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:49.210
What did you do with Jin Si-kyun's belongings...

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.800
Doing those strange things

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.110
They all know

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:58.310
Always treat casually and buy some time

00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:00.650
I'll think about it

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:05.770
No matter what, take him out

00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:08.410
If I'm caught

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:10.609
I'll give you up to the police too

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:12.759
Oh, are you threatening me?

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.780
Looks like you haven't figured out the situation at all

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.129
If you can't figure it out

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:20.039
Look again at how Jin Shi-jian is lying there

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:21.040
Also

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:23.910
Don't be cocky, Yu Su-jin

00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:28.280
Do as I say

00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:29.640
I'll contact you again

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:45.260
Captain Ahn obtained permission here through Representative Bai

00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:48.730
Today's homeowner for the cleaning company is Kim Jae-hoon

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:51.049
Hey, not sure if it's a coincidence

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:52.550
Currently shot and in the hospital

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:56.000
Next, zoom in here

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:07.110
Kim Jae-hoon is a stolen name

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:09.280
It's definitely Jin Shi-jian

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:11.480
Hey, Ji-hoon

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.089
You can't enter here without permission

00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:21.889
This is the emergency room, a crowded place

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:23.530
A criminal has come in

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:26.610
Executing officia

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:41.540
This person is Jin Shijian

00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:46.300
Jin Shijian

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:49.200
is a drug trafficker urgently sought by the special headquarters

00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:53.670
The wide search team is going to take over this case now.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.630
It's alright.

00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:39.330
Hang in there a bit longer...

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:43.309
Can he be transferred to a regular ward?

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:44.889
Police and reporters

00:43:44.890 --> 00:43:46.880
There are too many people, it's hard to treat.

00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:50.100
Also, it's difficult for me to care for gunshot patients.

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:52.359
I don't know what crisis might arise.

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:53.860
So he can't be sent to a general ward.

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:58.879
-=Police=-

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:04.220
-=Critical Care Room=-

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:01.189
From here, general personnel entry is prohibited.

00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:02.480
Let's wait until visiting hours to conduct the investigation.

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.029
How did you end up like this?

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:25.760
Is it okay with you to deceive others as long as you achieve your goal?

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.010
I'll definitely arrest you.

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:30.230
You absolutely cannot arrest me.

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:32.880
Because I didn't commit any crime.

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:46.030
You won't catch me.

00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:56.440
It's over now.

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:00.560
Brother.

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:02.280
Stop it, please.

00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:03.970
Brother.

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:07.980
Have you ever truly treated me as a brother, even once?

00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:12.009
You must be thrilled thinking about catching the criminal.

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:13.620
Evidence has been secured.

00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:16.120
You have nowhere to escape.

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:19.589
Yes, I trusted you so much, handed everything over to you.

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:20.650
Of course, evidence has been secured.

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:23.920
I will be arrested and sentenced like this.

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:25.880
What are you going to do?

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.850
Isn't it a crime to deceive others?

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:38.220
Watch closely.

00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:40.550
This is the price of your crime.

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:43.460
Hey, Park Kyung-soo.

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:44.910
Just wait.

00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:47.990
Brother.

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:40.299
Police have arrested those producing drugs overseas,

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:43.009
and controlling the distribution network in South Korea,

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:45.509
the godfather of the drug world, Kim Si-chang.

00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:47.839
Mr. Kim was shot during a drug deal.

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:49.619
He entered the emergency room under someone else's name.

00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:53.660
-=Police discovered suspicious circumstances at the hospital..=-

00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:51.829
However, during the on-site search for other cases,

00:46:51.830 --> 00:46:54.080
Detective B, belonging to the metropolitan investigation team,

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:56.369
realized he was the major drug trafficker the special department was seeking, and arrested him.

00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:58.390
Hmm.

00:46:59.080 --> 00:46:59.730
Strange things were found in Kim Si-chang's car.

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:02.430
Evidence of drugs lost last month at Incheon Port

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:07.829
mostly appeared in his car.

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:09.130
How much?

00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:11.339
Methcathinone, ketamine, liquid marijuana injectors,

00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:15.280
everything that was lost has been found.

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:17.310
That indicates

00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:19.750
someone inside sold the evidence to Kim Si-chang.

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:24.210
Exactly.

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:25.210
During this period, all the missing drug evidence

00:47:25.211 --> 00:47:28.059
seems to have been distributed externally through Kim Si-chang.

00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:30.420
There must be someone inside the police with connections to Kim Si-chang.

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:34.400
There must be someone in the police connected to Jin Shi Jian.

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:39.030
How's the investigation going?

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:42.959
We handed over Kim Shi-jian's phone to the digital forensics team.

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.930
We need to wait for the results to make sense of it.

00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:49.339
The person involved is definitely an active-duty officer.

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:51.399
Don't act rashly until we have clear evidence.

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:52.400
Got it?

00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:53.880
Okay, understood.

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:27.400
Who is it?

00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:30.390
Who else could it be? Your wife?

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:32.120
Me?

00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:35.600
The one who bought you this car.

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:38.409
Prepared for a day like today.

00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:40.610
I even registered my fingerprint.

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:42.519
You should already know.

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.449
The one who made the deal with you was Kim Shi-jian.

00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:46.160
So I'll get right to the point.

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:47.539
I want to bail Kim Shi-jian out.

00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:48.540
You need to help me.

00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:53.470
The hospital is full of police.

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:57.969
He'll be transferred to another hospital tomorrow, increasing the police presence.

00:48:57.970 --> 00:48:59.390
Don't be ridiculous.

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:04.720
Cover up all investigations related to Kim Shi-jian.

00:49:08.890 --> 00:49:09.890
Oh, come on.

00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:11.919
What? Can't you do it?

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:14.110
It's too big. It can't be covered up.

00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:16.330
Fine.

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:19.390
Then continue the investigation. You dig deeper.

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:23.910
Dig deep with a sense of mission, happily.

00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:27.940
But what happens when digging deeper leads to yourself?

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:31.610
What? Chickened out?

00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:34.090
Don't be afraid

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:01.150
Hey

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:04.110
Your remarkable friend

00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:06.239
When he started buying Paracetamol all the time

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:07.849
I knew something was off

00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:09.009
What kind of lunatic

00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:11.540
Buys sedatives at parties

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.670
And specifically Paracetamol

00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:18.849
Because it's also pretty good as a sleeping pill

00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:20.590
Don't talk nonsense

00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:23.010
Euthanasia

00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:26.400
It's just euthanasia, right?

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:30.060
I'm a very perceptive businessman

00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:32.580
In my line of work

00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:35.059
People like you who are hard to control

00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:35.860
And cause trouble

00:50:35.861 --> 00:50:37.649
I can't tolerate at all

00:50:37.650 --> 00:50:38.650
Absolutely

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.360
What do you want?

00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:44.940
Trying to hike up drug prices?

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.960
If you made a mistake

00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:51.360
Just admit it properly

00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:53.030
Huh?

00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:58.639
Without my permission

00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:02.110
You used my stuff without authorization

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:04.019
How you'll pay for this

00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:06.060
We'll discuss when you bring Jin Shijian to meet me

00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:09.350
There are cops in every corner of the hospital

00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:13.889
It's completely impossible to get Jin Shijian out of there

00:51:13.890 --> 00:51:16.459
And once she's out of the military hospital tomorrow

00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:18.260
We might change hospitals.

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:19.890
Hello?

00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:21.890
Yu So Jin, you

00:51:21.891 --> 00:51:23.759
Stop saying "no" in front of me.

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:26.880
Also, you must get Kim Shi-jin out.

00:51:28.090 --> 00:51:29.090
And

00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:34.229
Am I not worried about your nephews?

00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:35.730
Don't touch the kids.

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:39.009
If you dare touch them, I won't just sit by.

00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:40.380
I'm not afraid of anything now.

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:44.540
Are you threatening me now?

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:48.760
If I get caught, do you think you'll be okay?

00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:50.709
You don't want me to go crazy.

00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:51.829
Tell everything to the police,

00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:53.089
leading to your downfall.

00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:54.180
You don't want it to end up like this, do you?

00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:56.620
Kim Shi-jin, get yourself out.

00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:58.960
Stop bothering me and those around me.

00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:02.150
Ouch.

00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:05.360
Hey, Yu So Jin.

00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:07.510
Are you sure you won't regret this?

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:24.880
Completely insane.

00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:51.700
This lantern chili is so delicious.

00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:56.149
Lost 2 kilograms last month from heartache.

00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:57.700
Looks like I'm gaining weight again.

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:03.040
Others might think you're eating different food from mine.

00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:04.490
Is it not tasty?

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:08.079
Why do I think everything tastes so good?

00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:09.760
Not a growing kid.

00:53:10.210 --> 00:53:12.079
Went to training camps and similar places when I was young.

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:13.839
Even food that others find tasteless

00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:15.480
I find delicious

00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:20.850
Try this, it's really tasty

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:34.030
Hey, get out of the way

00:53:34.690 --> 00:53:35.830
Move quickly

00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:48.339
Hurry up and get a bed, call for help

00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:49.340
Ah, yes

00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:06.700
Over here

00:54:12.010 --> 00:54:13.450
Bang

00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:18.550
It hurts, it hurts

00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:20.540
Doctor Yu

00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:23.419
Just pretend you don't know and walk away

00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:24.740
Stay out of it

00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:28.929
The cafeteria fire and the hospital repairs

00:54:28.930 --> 00:54:29.970
Did you arrange them?

00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:32.809
Didn't you tell me to handle it?

00:54:32.810 --> 00:54:34.339
This is my style

00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:35.389
What are you trying to do?

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:36.839
There are too many police

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:38.539
The hospital has many patients too

00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:40.410
Aren't they all like flies?

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:42.650
What do you do if you want to get rid of flies?

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:44.859
An accident needs to happen

00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:46.020
Are you crazy?

00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:47.609
Stop immediately

00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:50.540
Girls are all smitten with their crazy big brother

00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:51.889
What, don't you like it?

00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:53.100
Don't you like me?

00:54:56.190 --> 00:54:58.220
There will be another explosion soon

00:54:58.500 --> 00:54:59.500
Don't brag
I'll do it

00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:02.289
I'll do it, you don't have to do anything.

00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:03.659
What you can do

00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:04.660
Now I say I'm going to do it

00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:06.319
I will be responsible

00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:07.390
I can do it

00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:14.880
Okay, I'll give you 5 minutes.

00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:17.190
Looking forward to your performance

00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:39.380
Park your car in front of the funeral home and wait for me

00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:41.410
I will personally take Jin Shijian there.

00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:48.160
-=Regulated Area=-

00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:02.020
You are here

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.260
I'll be your hostage, let's get out.

00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:14.480
Get out of here, you bastard.

00:57:14.810 --> 00:57:16.049
Get lost

00:57:16.050 --> 00:57:17.630
Otherwise I'll kill you all.

00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:24.450
-=Emergency Center=-

00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:27.039
Hello

00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:28.510
Come in and take a look quickly

00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:41.469
- What happened? - Criminal in the intensive care unit

00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:43.520
He took the medical staff hostage and escaped.

00:57:56.350 --> 00:57:57.350
Hey, get out of here!

00:57:57.540 --> 00:57:58.190
Get out of the way

00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:59.509
Get lost

00:57:59.510 --> 00:58:00.420
Jin Shijian threw away the knife

00:58:00.421 --> 00:58:01.519
Throw it away

00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:02.520
Turn around

00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:05.060
Jin Shijian threw away the knife

00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:07.230
Don't come over here

00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:09.039
- She's going to die. - Get out of the way.

00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:10.829
- She'll die. - Back off.

00:58:10.830 --> 00:58:13.220
-Drop the knife. -Stay away, you guys.

00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:17.960
Get out of the way

00:58:28.090 --> 00:58:29.760
Hey, hey, hey, block them.

00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:35.110
Get in the car quickly

00:58:35.830 --> 00:58:36.830
Get in the car

00:59:38.550 --> 00:59:41.560
-=Death Doctor Mary=-

00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:42.989
You said it was kidnapping

00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:44.160
How serious the injury

00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:46.320
Yu Suzhen, are you okay?

00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:50.050
You have been identified as a criminal and are under investigation.

00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:53.040
I would be very grateful if you could kill me

00:59:53.310 --> 00:59:54.310
Are you crazy?

00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:56.159
When being pursued by the police

00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:57.469
I want to do that again.

00:59:57.470 --> 01:00:01.580
Over time, this may become a human right.

01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:06.290
This is a completely new business project, right?

01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:08.150
Drink
