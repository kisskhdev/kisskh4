PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:57.617
Ga-ram.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.710
Are you all right?

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.546
Ga-ram, what's wrong?

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.339
It's because…

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:13.842
What is it? What's wrong?

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:16.010
I told you to stop drinking too much.

00:02:21.015 --> 00:02:22.350
Geez.

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:24.352
- Drinking?
- Yes.

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:28.982
He drank with me to celebrate
the Rugby Team passing the tryouts.

00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:33.111
I mean…

00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:36.739
Come. He'll get punished
if the vice principal finds out.

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:40.034
I'll hide him in my room
so he can sober up, all right?

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:42.120
- What?
- Get going.

00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:44.497
Coach Bae, please keep it a secret.

00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:46.499
- Okay.
- Go on then.

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:48.293
- Yes.
- Go on.

SANG-GI

00:03:40.094 --> 00:03:43.139
<i>Ga-ram, why aren't you at training?</i>
<i>Did you sleep in?</i>

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.309
Hey, Sang-gi.

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:47.977
<i>Coach was looking for you.</i>

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:52.565
<i>Why are you quiet? Are you there?</i>

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:56.194
<i>I told him you were in the restroom.</i>
<i>Hurry up.</i>

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:57.612
Okay.

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:01.366
I'll be there. Yeah.

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:29.018
- Are you all right?
- I think it's a cramp.

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.521
Don't be a baby. Get up.

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:33.356
- Hey!
- Get up. Come on.

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:34.399
Let's go. Hurry.

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:35.984
Hey, Ga-ram. What's wrong?

00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:37.235
I think I have a cramp.

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:39.404
He's trying to avoid training
by making a fuss.

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:40.321
Damn you.

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:42.699
Come on, focus.
The finals are just around the corner.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:43.700
Yes, sir.

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:45.868
- Get back to it.
- Yes.

00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:57.797
<i>Myasthenia Gravis?</i>

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.757
I've never heard of it before.

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:04.387 line:20%
It makes your muscles
abnormally weak or tire easily.

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:07.557
The exact cause
hasn't been discovered yet.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.351
That can't be right.

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:12.645
You know who I am.

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:13.771
I'm Ju Ga-ram.

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:17.567
Why would an athlete of all people
get a disease like this?

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.945
A disease doesn't discriminate.

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:24.407
Anyone can get a disease.

00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:29.746
What about rugby?
I can still play though, right?

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:51.601
Mr. Ju Ga-ram.

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:03.529
Your regular checkup
was due a long time ago.

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:07.158
What about your medicine?
You must have taken it all by now.

00:06:07.241 --> 00:06:08.826
I still have some left.

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:12.663
Since you had paralysis,
let's do the EMG first.

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:14.082
Next time.

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:17.001
I have to go back to school today.

00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:20.630
If respiratory paralysis recurs,
even a slight delay can be fatal.

00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:22.757
The paralysis was only temporary.

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:24.884
I had a lot going on recently.

00:06:24.967 --> 00:06:26.511
As for my breathing,

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.222
I've been checking it, as you can see.

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.682
I'll get tested next time.

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:47.198
WE WISH FOR HANYANG HIGH'S VICTORY

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:53.955
Hello.

00:06:54.038 --> 00:06:55.998
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:05.007
Today's lunch is so good.

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:06.884
- Did you get more?
- Yes.

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:08.553
- It's your second plate?
- That's enough.

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:11.222
Eat your food.

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:16.894
Can alcohol dehydrogenase
increase with age?

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:21.941
It can, if you keep drinking.
But it puts a strain on your liver.

00:07:23.484 --> 00:07:25.361
Why? Did Ga-ram ask you for a drink?

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:27.864
Are you crazy? Why would I drink with him?

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:29.240
What is it, then?

00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:33.244
I can't believe he drank
until his legs gave out,

00:07:34.078 --> 00:07:36.706
especially since he'd never drunk before.

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:38.166
Do you have lingering attachments?

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:39.792
No freaking way.

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:41.085
Then stop caring about him.

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:44.797
What's it to you if he drinks alcohol
or bathes in it?

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:46.257
Rugby Team!

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:50.219
Let's practice after lunch.

00:07:50.803 --> 00:07:53.598
How? The Track and Field Team
has the field all day.

00:07:56.058 --> 00:07:58.853
Stir-fried spicy pork. Nice.

00:07:58.936 --> 00:07:59.812
Do you want some?

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:08.988
Here, have some tea.

00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:10.490
Okay.

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:16.204
Now that the Rugby Team has a new player,
let's redistribute the field time.

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:19.707
They should be able to train.

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:23.586
The track and field coach said

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:27.298
the summer off-season training paid off.

00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:28.758
That's great news.

00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:32.303
Okay. So?

00:08:32.386 --> 00:08:35.765
The school shouldn't break their momentum.

00:08:35.848 --> 00:08:39.894
What if changing the training schedule
causes their records to drop?

00:08:39.977 --> 00:08:41.979
How will we look them in the eye?

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:45.483
Let Coach Ju find a place.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:50.404
There must be a spot somewhere
for the Rugby Team to train.

00:08:50.488 --> 00:08:54.492
Are you saying they can practice anywhere

00:08:54.575 --> 00:08:58.496
as long as they don't affect other teams?

00:08:58.579 --> 00:09:00.414
Yes. Sure.

00:09:00.998 --> 00:09:01.916
Okay.

00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:09.799
- What are we doing here?
- I don't know why we're here.

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:12.510
Doesn't he look familiar?

00:09:12.593 --> 00:09:14.011
Wait? Isn't that Seok-bong?

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:15.555
- Nice.
- Seok-bong.

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:17.098
You're all here.

00:09:17.181 --> 00:09:18.766
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:22.603
Hey, swimming genius.

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:26.899
Why did you call us to the pool?

00:09:34.365 --> 00:09:37.034 line:20%
This is Hanyang's Rugby Team!

00:09:39.453 --> 00:09:41.289
Damn it…

00:09:41.372 --> 00:09:42.832
- What?
- What?

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:51.132
Let's go!

00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:56.387
Darn it.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:57.888
Wait, please don't touch me.

00:09:57.972 --> 00:09:59.557
- It's all right.
- I don't want to.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.392
I really don't want this.

00:10:01.475 --> 00:10:03.603
- One.
- I said no.

00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:04.812
- Two.
- Come on!

00:10:04.895 --> 00:10:06.188
- Three!
- I said no!

00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:14.864
Focus.

00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:18.618
Seong-jun, Ung, Seon-ho,
and Ju-yang are on one team.

00:10:18.701 --> 00:10:20.161
- Okay.
- The rest are on the other.

00:10:20.244 --> 00:10:25.583
Each half is ten minutes long.
Touch the ball on the edge for a try.

00:10:25.666 --> 00:10:26.500
- Okay!
- Okay!

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:30.880
The losing team will clean up
and wash the winners' swimsuits.

00:10:30.963 --> 00:10:32.298
Okay!

00:10:32.381 --> 00:10:33.424
Start!

00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:36.761
Go, go!

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:45.603
Get the ball. Hurry!

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.406
LET'S FILL THIS POOL WITH SWEAT

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.576
Was this Ms. Kang's plan all along?

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.411
That would definitely help them.

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:04.288
The water reduces the chance of injury,

00:11:04.872 --> 00:11:07.667
and they can do
both cardio and strength training.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.585
I should try it with my players too.

00:11:14.173 --> 00:11:16.008
There's no need to worry.

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:19.136
The Swim Team will be back next week
after the competition.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.888
That'll put an end to this.

00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:22.139
Foul.

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:24.475
But we still need to keep an eye on them.

00:11:25.059 --> 00:11:26.644
Okay. I'll keep an eye on them.

00:11:37.905 --> 00:11:39.615
Did Nak-gyun refuse
to renew your contract?

00:11:41.492 --> 00:11:44.245
He is always in the way of everything.

00:11:44.328 --> 00:11:46.414
I feel rather relieved.

00:11:46.997 --> 00:11:48.457
I became a player-coach

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:51.710
because no pro team would take me
when I still wanted to play.

00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:53.629
But now,

00:11:53.712 --> 00:11:57.550
I find myself thinking,
"How can I last longer as a coach?"

00:11:58.801 --> 00:11:59.718
I want…

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.013
to give it my all again.

00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:07.852
One of my players mentioned
they will retire after this year,

00:12:07.935 --> 00:12:10.438
so we'll probably have an opening.

00:12:10.521 --> 00:12:13.315
But at your age, we can't take you
without experience on Team Korea.

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:16.610
I understand.

00:12:16.694 --> 00:12:18.696
Pass the coming national tryouts.

00:12:18.779 --> 00:12:20.406
Then I'll see what I can do.

00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:23.492
- You can do it, right?
- Thank you, Sang-a.

00:12:37.798 --> 00:12:43.929
Even when using someone else's gun,
every shot hits the target.

00:12:44.513 --> 00:12:50.853
How could you score zero points
ten times in a row, U-jin?

00:12:53.772 --> 00:12:55.274
Do you plan to quit?

00:12:56.525 --> 00:12:57.359
No.

00:12:57.443 --> 00:12:59.028
Then why did you shoot like that?

00:12:59.695 --> 00:13:03.866
How could an athlete
lose on purpose when competing?

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:11.832
Now?

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:13.125
Did you just arrive now?

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:15.920
I took a half-day off
in case I was going to be late.

00:13:16.003 --> 00:13:16.837
A half-day off?

00:13:17.588 --> 00:13:22.009
Our team has been utterly humiliated.
I can't even hold my head up.

00:13:22.092 --> 00:13:24.386
But you took a half-day off?

00:13:25.346 --> 00:13:29.016
It's because her coach is so thoughtless.

00:13:29.099 --> 00:13:33.187
She pays attention only to her training,
not to her coaching duties.

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:35.105
That's why
something so ridiculous happened!

00:13:37.691 --> 00:13:38.609 line:20%
I'm sorry.

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:41.862
What would be a fitting punishment
for you?

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:46.450
CAPTAIN: SEO U-JIN
VICE-CAPTAIN: NA SEOL-HYEON

00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:47.576
Seo U-jin.

00:13:48.869 --> 00:13:50.496
You're no longer the captain.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:55.626
As of today,
Seol-hyeon is our new captain.

00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:57.753
Me?

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:03.050
I-ji, I'll let you train
as much as you want.

00:14:03.133 --> 00:14:05.219
We'll begin with the basics.

00:14:05.302 --> 00:14:06.387
Posture training.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:10.641
Until the end of the day,
you'll stand here and do posture training.

00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:12.851
Okay. Get started.

00:14:18.065 --> 00:14:19.567
SHOOTING RANGE

00:14:21.652 --> 00:14:23.362
TRAINING

00:14:23.445 --> 00:14:24.280
REST

00:14:53.851 --> 00:14:59.273
You're not a robot after all. I mean,
she is getting punished because of you.

00:14:59.356 --> 00:15:03.402
- Do you have time to worry about others?
- Do I need time to do that?

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:19.168
It's too narrow here.

00:15:20.461 --> 00:15:22.755
The parking lot? There are too many cars.

00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:28.218
If I crush all their cars,
will they give up the field out of spite?

00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:29.637
Would they?

00:15:34.308 --> 00:15:35.684
What's that for, Ms. Kang?

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.394
Is this your home?

00:15:37.478 --> 00:15:39.939
Why are you here all the time?

00:15:40.022 --> 00:15:42.900
I can't do it at the security office
with the vice principal on my neck.

00:15:48.155 --> 00:15:49.239
Here's the rent.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.117
What is this?

00:15:52.201 --> 00:15:57.331 line:20%
You have to manage your blood sugar
early if you want to keep eating sweets.

00:15:59.124 --> 00:16:01.669
You're the one who eats them all.

00:16:01.752 --> 00:16:06.131
It was all for you.
I wanted you to eat less sugar, Ms. Kang.

00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:10.552
HANYANG HIGH FLOOR PLAN

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:12.638
Is the pool not enough?

00:16:12.721 --> 00:16:14.223
Not even close.

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:16.976
That was only a temporary measure.

00:16:17.601 --> 00:16:19.979
We need a proper field.

00:16:56.015 --> 00:16:57.933
You're trying to make a statement.

00:16:59.226 --> 00:17:00.686
Put your arm down!

00:17:04.148 --> 00:17:07.067
Geez. You're something, indeed.

00:17:08.068 --> 00:17:10.070
If you still want to shoot, go for it.

00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:46.565
Are you all right?

00:17:46.648 --> 00:17:50.069
I want to say that I am,
but as you can see…

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:54.239
This is because of me.

00:17:55.491 --> 00:17:56.575
I'm sorry.

00:17:57.451 --> 00:18:00.079
This wasn't all because of you,
so don't worry.

00:18:02.289 --> 00:18:05.417
You were right.
It's never okay for any athlete to lose.

00:18:09.505 --> 00:18:12.299
You get treated the way I do
if you don't win.

00:18:14.551 --> 00:18:18.764
So win at all costs. Don't be carried away
by Ga-ram's nonsense.

00:18:18.847 --> 00:18:20.432
Or you'll end up like me.

00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:23.727
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:18:42.996 --> 00:18:44.998
I can't believe you actually did it.

00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:47.751
And what if I hadn't?

00:18:47.835 --> 00:18:51.839
I had to make sure he owed me good,
so he wouldn't complain about my training.

00:18:51.922 --> 00:18:54.174
I know, but still…

00:18:54.258 --> 00:18:58.095
If I pass the national tryouts,
Sang-a can get me on her team.

00:18:58.178 --> 00:18:59.972
She coaches there, right?

00:19:01.557 --> 00:19:03.851
I have to give it my all in this tryout.

00:19:04.351 --> 00:19:06.436
This is my last chance.

00:19:08.647 --> 00:19:09.815
Hey, did you hear?

00:19:10.691 --> 00:19:12.401
Hell broke loose in the Shooting Team.

00:19:12.484 --> 00:19:13.861
Coach Bae was punished all day.

00:19:13.944 --> 00:19:15.571
- U-jin lost her captaincy.
- What?

00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:17.865
- When?
- Today.

00:19:17.948 --> 00:19:19.158
Isn't that crazy?

00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:21.827
Because of the special admission tryouts?

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:22.744
Of course.

00:19:23.704 --> 00:19:25.497
There would be no other reason.

00:19:30.794 --> 00:19:31.712
I'll go apologize.

00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:35.674
It's all because of me.

00:19:35.757 --> 00:19:37.050
Why would you apologize?

00:19:38.051 --> 00:19:39.469
It wasn't because of you.

00:19:41.346 --> 00:19:42.472
What?

00:19:42.556 --> 00:19:44.766
I asked her to let us win.

00:19:45.809 --> 00:19:48.312
She wouldn't lose
just because you asked her to.

00:19:48.395 --> 00:19:49.396
How would you know?

00:19:51.732 --> 00:19:53.400
I didn't expect it to turn out like this.

00:19:54.985 --> 00:19:56.111
This is driving me nuts.

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:02.284
She didn't need to go that far.

00:20:04.411 --> 00:20:05.913
That's not it.

00:20:05.996 --> 00:20:11.126
There was so much to do as the captain.
It interfered with my training, so I quit.

00:20:13.921 --> 00:20:18.008
<i>Good job.</i>
<i>Being a captain won't do you any good.</i>

00:20:18.091 --> 00:20:19.259
I know.

00:20:19.343 --> 00:20:22.596
<i>Then why make me anxious?</i>

00:20:22.679 --> 00:20:25.557
<i>Is it that hard</i>
<i>to send the training log right away?</i>

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:28.101
I won't be late starting tomorrow.

00:20:40.781 --> 00:20:42.741
Did you eavesdrop? Are you a stalker?

00:20:42.824 --> 00:20:44.618
Come on. I'm no stalker.

00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:47.412
I just overheard it.

00:20:51.583 --> 00:20:52.501
Are you all right?

00:20:54.378 --> 00:20:55.212
What do you mean?

00:20:55.295 --> 00:20:58.757
I heard you got scolded
and lost your captaincy.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.843
- Sorry.
- Why would you be sorry?

00:21:04.388 --> 00:21:07.808
I accused you of snitching
on our archery plan.

00:21:08.558 --> 00:21:12.938
You got punished too,
just for doing me a favor.

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:15.774
Right, snitching.

00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:18.777
Apology accepted.

00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:22.739
But you had nothing to do
with the tryouts, so don't apologize.

00:21:24.408 --> 00:21:25.534
You don't have to lie.

00:21:25.617 --> 00:21:27.953
You did it
because I asked you to let us win.

00:21:28.036 --> 00:21:29.121
That's not true.

00:21:30.998 --> 00:21:34.668
Then why did you do it?

00:21:34.751 --> 00:21:36.795
I have no reason to tell you, do I?

00:21:38.213 --> 00:21:39.840
Well, hey…

00:21:40.841 --> 00:21:42.050
Did you know?

00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:46.138
My coach and your coach
were a legendary couple at school.

00:21:46.221 --> 00:21:47.431
So?

00:21:47.514 --> 00:21:48.765
What's your take on that?

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:54.438
Is that something I need to think about?

00:21:54.521 --> 00:21:58.358
It's just when you play
while relying on each other…

00:21:59.359 --> 00:22:05.032
What was it? I think it creates synergy.

00:22:10.078 --> 00:22:11.663
You should think about it.

00:22:14.207 --> 00:22:17.669
It looks like they're hurting each other
rather than creating synergy.

00:22:18.545 --> 00:22:20.005
Come on, just…

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:22.799
take some time to think seriously about--

00:22:22.883 --> 00:22:24.301
Seong-jun.

00:22:24.384 --> 00:22:27.304
How can you still be so clueless
when you're all grown up?

00:22:28.555 --> 00:22:31.767
I mean… At times like this,

00:22:32.684 --> 00:22:34.311
I just want to be there for you.

00:22:34.394 --> 00:22:36.104
I've told you, haven't I?

00:22:37.522 --> 00:22:38.899
Leave me alone.

00:22:44.905 --> 00:22:47.074
I can't seem to do that.

00:22:47.157 --> 00:22:48.366
Dang it.

00:22:50.577 --> 00:22:52.162
Geez, oh goodness.

00:22:55.582 --> 00:22:57.667
Hey. He just got dumped.

00:22:59.503 --> 00:23:01.129
He got rejected.

00:23:01.213 --> 00:23:02.631
What is he doing?

00:23:06.134 --> 00:23:07.552
Darn it.

00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:14.476
A spacious place where they can run
at full speed after kicking the ball.

00:23:15.102 --> 00:23:17.771
A suitable opponent
with low risk of injury.

00:23:18.522 --> 00:23:20.482
Is there a way
to solve these two issues at once?

00:23:20.565 --> 00:23:21.650
Seok-bong.

00:23:23.318 --> 00:23:27.948
Where did he go,
leaving the restaurant unattended?

00:23:28.907 --> 00:23:30.700
All right. Come on in.

00:23:30.784 --> 00:23:34.329
Since we won, it's on the house.

00:23:34.412 --> 00:23:35.831
Order everything on the menu!

00:23:37.082 --> 00:23:38.750
- It's on me.
- Fries?

00:23:38.834 --> 00:23:39.751
Coach Ju!

00:23:41.211 --> 00:23:42.587
SANGYEONG MORNING SOCCER CLUB

00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:43.839
It's not that bad.

00:23:44.881 --> 00:23:47.425
- Considering it doesn't have rugby posts.
- Right?

00:23:47.509 --> 00:23:49.094
- Nice.
- Wow.

00:23:49.177 --> 00:23:50.470
- Coach Ju.
- Yes.

00:23:50.554 --> 00:23:52.139
Do we train here from now on?

00:23:53.431 --> 00:23:56.935
Yes. I got permission
from the principal to train outside.

00:23:58.311 --> 00:24:01.148
The ground is so nice
and well taken care of.

00:24:01.231 --> 00:24:02.858
Let's unpack and get going.

00:24:02.941 --> 00:24:04.317
No, hold on.

00:24:04.401 --> 00:24:06.862
There is one thing
we need to do before that.

00:24:07.988 --> 00:24:09.322
What is it?

00:24:09.406 --> 00:24:11.491
It's a warm-up. Yes.

00:24:12.826 --> 00:24:13.994
Shouldn't we unpack first?

00:24:14.077 --> 00:24:15.495
We do warm-ups all the time.

00:24:16.454 --> 00:24:18.290
- For goodness' sake.
- Darn it.

00:24:19.166 --> 00:24:20.000
What is it?

00:24:22.043 --> 00:24:23.003
SANGYEONG

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:30.635
- You're here.
- Coach Ju?

00:24:30.719 --> 00:24:31.970
- Yes.
- Nice to meet you.

00:24:32.637 --> 00:24:34.472
Are these the ones you talked about?

00:24:34.556 --> 00:24:36.850
- Yes.
- Awesome.

00:24:36.933 --> 00:24:39.728
They remind me of the good old days.
Especially that one.

00:24:42.189 --> 00:24:46.776
We went to a lot of trouble
since it was a favor from our ace, Mr. Ma.

00:24:47.402 --> 00:24:49.738
Are you going to make us sweat today?

00:24:49.821 --> 00:24:52.657
Of course. Look how buff they are.

00:24:53.533 --> 00:24:55.202
- You can trust me.
- Okay.

00:24:55.285 --> 00:24:57.120
Shall we warm up then?

00:24:57.204 --> 00:24:58.747
- Okay.
- Go, Sangyeong!

00:25:00.749 --> 00:25:02.042
Let's go!

00:25:04.753 --> 00:25:09.424
- I thought we were training.
- Yes, after an hour of soccer with them.

00:25:09.507 --> 00:25:12.052
Also, this is training too.

00:25:12.135 --> 00:25:14.262
I played soccer until middle school.

00:25:14.346 --> 00:25:16.598
They didn't do soccer,
but always played sports.

00:25:17.724 --> 00:25:19.809
Those old guys don't stand a chance.

00:25:19.893 --> 00:25:24.898
Really? You never know until you play.
But you do have a point.

00:25:24.981 --> 00:25:27.067
So, we'll add some rules.

00:25:27.943 --> 00:25:29.861
- The rugby rules.
- What? Rugby rules?

00:25:29.945 --> 00:25:32.364
No passing forward.
Just sideways or backward.

00:25:32.447 --> 00:25:33.782
To score…

00:25:33.865 --> 00:25:35.533
Since there's no try in soccer,

00:25:35.617 --> 00:25:38.995
you score only when you drive the ball
to the post. Okay?

00:25:40.664 --> 00:25:41.581
- That's easy.
- Okay.

00:25:41.665 --> 00:25:42.582
We'll go get them!

00:25:42.666 --> 00:25:44.584
- Let's get them sweating.
- Yes. Let's go.

00:25:58.139 --> 00:25:59.599
Let's do this!

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:01.601
Go, Sangyeong!

00:26:05.855 --> 00:26:07.816
Foul! We're playing by rugby rules.

00:26:07.899 --> 00:26:08.858
Hand over the ball.

00:26:10.193 --> 00:26:11.361
Yes!

00:26:11.444 --> 00:26:13.738
What? You can't start right away.

00:26:17.534 --> 00:26:18.576
- Nice.
- Foul!

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:19.911
- What?
- Why?

00:26:19.995 --> 00:26:21.955
The ball rolled forward
when you dropped it. Foul.

00:26:22.038 --> 00:26:23.039
I blocked it.

00:26:23.123 --> 00:26:25.375
You should have caught it.
Give the ball back.

00:26:29.379 --> 00:26:30.422
Two, three.

00:26:37.512 --> 00:26:40.098
If you shoot, it's a foul.

00:26:42.183 --> 00:26:44.144
- Grab it.
- Okay.

00:26:44.227 --> 00:26:45.395
Oh, right.

00:26:48.773 --> 00:26:49.983
Foul!

00:26:50.066 --> 00:26:51.609
- Come on, Captain.
- Warning!

00:26:52.277 --> 00:26:53.111
Captain.

00:27:07.208 --> 00:27:09.878
Coach Ju, you were good today.

00:27:09.961 --> 00:27:11.713
You're a fine referee.

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:13.923
Wait. Was it you?

00:27:14.007 --> 00:27:16.301
I thought Son Heung-min was here.

00:27:16.384 --> 00:27:18.470
No, I'm Ronaldo.

00:27:18.553 --> 00:27:20.722
- Goodness.
- Hold on.

00:27:20.805 --> 00:27:24.476
You weren't Messi?
Oh, you're the guy from the sign shop.

00:27:24.559 --> 00:27:25.810
Today was just my day.

00:27:25.894 --> 00:27:29.356
Geez. Did I crush young dreams?

00:27:29.439 --> 00:27:31.483
Yes, Messi. You were too hard on them.

00:27:31.566 --> 00:27:33.401
- Sorry.
- See you next week.

00:27:33.485 --> 00:27:36.696
I'll gather more people.
We can split into two or three teams.

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:38.782
Let's play even harder.

00:27:38.865 --> 00:27:41.743
Thank you. We'll be waiting!

00:27:41.826 --> 00:27:43.203
Sure. Nice job.

00:27:43.286 --> 00:27:44.829
- See you.
- Okay.

00:27:44.913 --> 00:27:46.581
- See you!
- Bye.

00:27:46.664 --> 00:27:47.957
I'm so hungry.

00:27:48.041 --> 00:27:49.667
Good game.

00:27:49.751 --> 00:27:51.336
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

00:27:51.419 --> 00:27:53.004
- Everyone, get up.
- I'm hungry.

00:27:53.088 --> 00:27:55.215
- Let's start practice now.
- Come on!

00:27:55.298 --> 00:27:58.301
We're going to die, Coach.

00:27:58.385 --> 00:28:00.261
- We can't get up.
- We can't.

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:03.306
Attention.

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:04.933
Yes.

00:28:05.809 --> 00:28:10.271
We only have seven players
for a seven-player game.

00:28:10.897 --> 00:28:16.236
That means you all need
to have the strength to play full-time.

00:28:16.319 --> 00:28:19.322
- Is that even possible?
- You have to do it to become champions!

00:28:20.657 --> 00:28:21.616
Champions?

00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:23.451
He's right.

00:28:24.619 --> 00:28:28.123
Our goal is to be the champions
of the Nationals.

00:28:32.836 --> 00:28:37.382
We need to achieve this
so our third-years can get into college.

00:28:38.133 --> 00:28:39.884
That will attract new recruits.

00:28:39.968 --> 00:28:43.972
That's the only way
for the team to survive at our school.

00:28:45.849 --> 00:28:48.643
Isn't that a bit unreasonable as a goal?

00:28:48.727 --> 00:28:50.270
So what? Are you going to give up?

00:28:51.771 --> 00:28:52.939
You want to play rugby.

00:29:00.447 --> 00:29:01.614
I do.

00:29:01.698 --> 00:29:03.241
Guys, let's get up.

00:29:03.324 --> 00:29:04.534
Yeah?

00:29:07.787 --> 00:29:09.164
Let's play rugby.

00:29:16.379 --> 00:29:18.423
Endure it. All right.

00:29:25.513 --> 00:29:26.931
No. Do it again.

00:29:41.488 --> 00:29:43.114
You're almost there. Let's go.

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:46.576
Run as fast as you can
to the Rugby Team's room!

00:29:50.413 --> 00:29:53.458
They must be coming back
from training outside.

00:29:55.043 --> 00:29:57.003
Ga-ram is a good rugby player, indeed.

00:29:57.086 --> 00:30:00.632
That's why the kids listen to him
without complaining.

00:30:00.715 --> 00:30:02.425
Which is not good, right?

00:30:03.426 --> 00:30:05.345
Why is he riding on the handcart?

00:30:05.428 --> 00:30:07.472
That's not very teacher-like.

00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:16.773
What are you doing?

00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:20.777
Hey, do you think
we can really win the Nationals?

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:26.866
Stop the nonsense and sleep.

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:30.370
Why do you always come at me?

00:30:31.287 --> 00:30:34.541
Why? Do you think we can't win
because we don't have synergy?

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:37.210
What synergy? Cut the crap.

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:41.381
When you play while relying on each other,

00:30:41.464 --> 00:30:42.882
it creates synergy.

00:30:42.966 --> 00:30:43.800
Hey!

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:48.805
- How do you know that?
- Synergy.

00:30:50.598 --> 00:30:51.850
Stop staring and answer…

00:31:05.238 --> 00:31:06.447
I believe in Coach Ju.

00:31:10.201 --> 00:31:12.287
I'm going to do whatever he says.

00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:14.205
I really want to win.

00:31:14.289 --> 00:31:17.083
We should get some sleep
if we want to win.

00:31:17.166 --> 00:31:18.835
- Okay.
- Good night.

00:31:23.214 --> 00:31:24.048
COLLEGE RUGBY TEAMS

00:31:24.132 --> 00:31:26.134
I see. You can't do it then, can you?

00:31:26.676 --> 00:31:29.470 line:20%
Got it. Maybe next time, then.

00:31:29.554 --> 00:31:30.388
Yes.

00:31:31.055 --> 00:31:31.890
Okay.

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.905
MATCH APPLICATION

00:31:46.988 --> 00:31:48.615
A practice match against a pro team?

00:31:48.698 --> 00:31:52.368
Other schools have already set up
practice matches with one another,

00:31:52.452 --> 00:31:53.536
so there's no room for us.

00:31:54.287 --> 00:31:57.832
Fortunately, OK Rugby Club
doesn't have a match that day.

00:31:57.916 --> 00:32:00.209
Didn't you use to play for that team?

00:32:00.293 --> 00:32:03.504
They're probably still not fond of you.

00:32:05.256 --> 00:32:06.466
I had to beg them.

00:32:08.009 --> 00:32:11.638
I have to beg a lot of people
now that I'm back.

00:32:11.721 --> 00:32:13.473
You only just realized that?

00:32:17.101 --> 00:32:18.686
We have a practice match.

00:32:19.729 --> 00:32:21.898
It's against OK Rugby Club.

00:32:21.981 --> 00:32:23.441
- What?
- Pardon?

00:32:25.193 --> 00:32:27.028
OK… A pro team?

00:32:28.488 --> 00:32:31.532
What if they bury us alive
during the practice match?

00:32:31.616 --> 00:32:32.659
You don't want it?

00:32:32.742 --> 00:32:33.993
- Not at all.
- I don't mean that…

00:32:34.953 --> 00:32:37.163
- I love it.
- Yes.

00:32:37.246 --> 00:32:40.625
They have more than ten national players
on their team.

00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:43.878
Are we up against Team Korea, then?

00:32:43.962 --> 00:32:45.421
It would be an honor.

00:32:47.548 --> 00:32:49.050
Let's give it a try!

00:32:49.133 --> 00:32:50.093
Yes!

00:32:50.176 --> 00:32:51.344
Okay.

00:32:51.427 --> 00:32:53.805
It's at 2:00 p.m. on the 13th.

00:32:53.888 --> 00:32:55.348
- At 2:00 p.m. on the 13th.
- The 13th.

00:32:55.431 --> 00:32:58.351
Let's prepare for a good pounding, guys.

00:32:58.434 --> 00:33:00.979
- Yes!
- Yeah!

00:33:03.189 --> 00:33:05.483
Okay. To the pool.

00:33:05.566 --> 00:33:06.943
It's not time yet.

00:33:07.026 --> 00:33:08.736
It hasn't been ten minutes, Coach.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.321
- Stop grumbling and come.
- Already?

00:33:14.283 --> 00:33:15.326
- Myeong-u.
- Captain, pass.

00:33:17.286 --> 00:33:18.121
Next, Ju-yang.

00:33:19.914 --> 00:33:20.957
Yeong-gwang.

00:33:25.336 --> 00:33:27.005
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

00:33:27.588 --> 00:33:29.716
Don't you want to play against Team Korea?

00:33:31.259 --> 00:33:32.301
Focus.

00:33:32.385 --> 00:33:36.014
I can't believe
Myeong-u's telling us to focus.

00:33:36.097 --> 00:33:38.016
I thought I was hearing things.

00:33:38.891 --> 00:33:41.310
Nice. Catch!

00:33:41.936 --> 00:33:43.730 line:20%
- On the 13th.
- On the 13th.

00:33:43.813 --> 00:33:45.898
- At 2:00 p.m.
- At 2:00 p.m.

00:33:45.982 --> 00:33:47.650
- At 2:00 p.m.
- On the 13th.

00:33:47.734 --> 00:33:48.651
On the 13th.

00:33:48.735 --> 00:33:49.569
At 2:00 p.m.

00:33:49.652 --> 00:33:50.528
At 2:00 p.m.

00:33:52.822 --> 00:33:54.115
I'm so beat.

00:34:01.205 --> 00:34:02.290
What are you doing?

00:34:04.125 --> 00:34:05.084
It's nothing.

00:34:06.919 --> 00:34:08.129
- Let's go running.
- What?

00:34:09.005 --> 00:34:11.758
Stop the nonsense
and do well during the game.

00:34:11.841 --> 00:34:13.301
Am I the only one who's excited?

00:34:13.384 --> 00:34:14.218
You're too excited.

00:34:14.302 --> 00:34:15.553
- Ung, do you want to run?
- Yes.

00:34:15.636 --> 00:34:17.847
Persuade them. Let's go running.

00:34:18.431 --> 00:34:20.016
- Let's go.
- It's roll call soon.

00:34:20.099 --> 00:34:21.601
- We can't go out.
- Let's go.

00:34:21.684 --> 00:34:23.478
- Drag him out.
- What about roll call?

00:34:23.561 --> 00:34:25.104
- We'll be back for it.
- Hurry.

00:34:25.188 --> 00:34:26.189
Yeong-gwang already left.

00:34:31.319 --> 00:34:32.236
Yes?

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.696
Coach, it's me, Yeong-gwang.

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:41.662
Right. Come in. Hey.

00:34:44.207 --> 00:34:45.541
What's gotten into you?

00:34:45.625 --> 00:34:47.001
Come and sit here.

00:34:47.085 --> 00:34:49.629
Yes. All right.

00:34:51.798 --> 00:34:53.257
I have something to tell you.

00:34:53.341 --> 00:34:54.425
Okay.

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:56.344
All right.

00:34:56.844 --> 00:34:57.678
What is it?

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.556
I can't play the practice match.

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:03.601
What do you mean?

00:35:03.684 --> 00:35:05.812
The police entrance exam is that day.

00:35:05.895 --> 00:35:06.729
What?

00:35:20.201 --> 00:35:21.786
TRAINING ABSENCE REQUEST LETTER

00:35:21.869 --> 00:35:23.371
TO TAKE THE POLICE EXAM…

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.419
Do you really want to be a police officer?

00:35:43.599 --> 00:35:44.767
Yeong-gwang.

00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:49.355
You know how important this semester is
as a rugby player

00:35:49.438 --> 00:35:52.316
for you and the guys.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.111
They won't take responsibility
for my life.

00:35:55.194 --> 00:35:57.780
You may have made a good living
as a rugby player,

00:35:57.864 --> 00:35:59.407
but I don't stand a chance.

00:36:00.158 --> 00:36:01.242
You know it too.

00:36:01.325 --> 00:36:03.327
So you're going to run away?

00:36:03.828 --> 00:36:05.997
Is that it? Without even trying?

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.665
I don't care if you disapprove.

00:36:08.416 --> 00:36:10.126
I'm going to take the exam anyway.

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:23.431
TRAINING ABSENCE REQUEST LETTER

00:36:23.514 --> 00:36:25.183
TO TAKE THE POLICE EXAM…

00:36:26.267 --> 00:36:27.393
Say that again.

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:28.895
You heard it.

00:36:28.978 --> 00:36:30.855
Don't you know how big a chance this is?

00:36:31.606 --> 00:36:34.275
I knew that jerk would do this one day.

00:36:34.358 --> 00:36:36.444
I'm done treating you with respect.

00:36:36.527 --> 00:36:37.528
Do as you wish.

00:36:38.487 --> 00:36:40.448
I can't let you guys ruin my life.

00:36:41.657 --> 00:36:43.034
This jerk.

00:36:44.785 --> 00:36:46.704
No, stop.

00:36:50.333 --> 00:36:51.542
- Hey!
- Just talk it out.

00:36:52.543 --> 00:36:53.461
Say it again.

00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:55.254
That jerk is talking crap.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:56.714
Stop!

00:36:59.217 --> 00:37:00.301
Darn it.

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:04.847
A fist fight among the players?

00:37:04.931 --> 00:37:06.849
- But Yeong-gwang--
- Seong-jun.

00:37:09.852 --> 00:37:13.231
Fighting is not allowed,
no matter the reason.

00:37:13.314 --> 00:37:18.527
You only fight in the stadium
until the last whistle blows.

00:37:18.611 --> 00:37:20.196
Isn't that the rugby spirit?

00:37:22.698 --> 00:37:25.576
Run until you understand
what you did wrong.

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:26.744
Go.

00:37:26.827 --> 00:37:27.912
Okay.

00:37:27.995 --> 00:37:28.871
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:38:28.848 --> 00:38:31.809
<i>You may have made a good living</i>
<i>as a rugby player,</i>

00:38:31.892 --> 00:38:33.728
<i>but I don't stand a chance.</i>

00:38:33.811 --> 00:38:35.521
<i>You know it too.</i>

00:38:38.024 --> 00:38:39.233
Oh Yeong-gwang.

00:38:53.748 --> 00:38:54.874
What are you doing out here?

00:38:59.211 --> 00:39:00.588
I don't want to get beaten.

00:39:03.799 --> 00:39:04.633
Come on out.

00:39:20.941 --> 00:39:22.610
Any change of thoughts?

00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:25.154
No.

00:39:26.781 --> 00:39:29.158
As a rugby coach,

00:39:30.951 --> 00:39:36.374
the one I'm responsible for
is rugby player Yeong-gwang,

00:39:36.957 --> 00:39:38.834
not the one
who wants to be a police officer.

00:39:38.918 --> 00:39:40.002
Take responsibility?

00:39:40.086 --> 00:39:42.254
How are you going to do that?

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:44.965
By winning the Nationals?

00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:46.217
Do you think that's possible?

00:39:47.301 --> 00:39:50.638
You had recruiters lined up
at your graduation,

00:39:51.972 --> 00:39:54.266
so you can't understand
what I'm dealing with.

00:39:55.976 --> 00:39:57.353
I didn't expect you to understand.

00:39:58.437 --> 00:39:59.897
I don't need your permission.

00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:01.565
Wait.

00:40:16.789 --> 00:40:20.251
<i>If you must go,</i>
<i>show me how determined you are.</i>

00:40:21.168 --> 00:40:22.336
HANYANG

00:40:24.046 --> 00:40:26.924
Perform 300 drop kicks,
and land 200 of them.

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:30.845
- Then I'll let you go.
- Are you serious?

00:40:30.928 --> 00:40:33.931
Even a pro player misses one
out of two drop kicks.

00:40:34.014 --> 00:40:37.977
And 300 drop kicks are equal
to a week's worth of practice.

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:40.479
So you're not going to do it?

00:40:41.063 --> 00:40:42.773
Is that how determined you are?

00:40:51.782 --> 00:40:52.616
One.

00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:58.664
Two.

00:41:02.209 --> 00:41:03.127
Three.

00:41:13.471 --> 00:41:14.513
A hundred ninety-eight.

00:41:22.938 --> 00:41:23.772
Do it again.

00:41:48.714 --> 00:41:49.548
Again.

00:42:01.977 --> 00:42:03.312
Three hundred.

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.455
How many did you make?

00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:25.000
A hundred and sixty-three.

00:42:26.001 --> 00:42:27.002
I was never…

00:42:28.504 --> 00:42:30.089
going to make 200 shots anyway.

00:42:30.172 --> 00:42:31.840
You said it yourself,

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:36.845
even a pro player
misses one drop kick out of two.

00:42:36.929 --> 00:42:40.516
Doesn't that make you
better than a pro player?

00:42:43.852 --> 00:42:47.106
Mo Sang-gi wore Number Five

00:42:48.732 --> 00:42:51.569
for Team Korea in the 2022 Asian Cup.

00:42:52.987 --> 00:42:57.575
He was a fly-half, just like you.

00:42:58.534 --> 00:43:04.790
He drop kicked 300 times
right here 20 years ago.

00:43:05.457 --> 00:43:08.711
He landed 147 of them.

00:43:12.631 --> 00:43:14.508
Who says you don't have potential?

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:19.972
Everyone reaches a point
when they can't play anymore.

00:43:21.056 --> 00:43:22.558
When that moment comes…

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:27.896
I don't want you to have regrets.

00:43:32.276 --> 00:43:33.319
For me…

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:36.572
rugby was everything.

00:43:40.993 --> 00:43:42.161
I thought…

00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:45.331
it would be the same for you.

00:43:48.709 --> 00:43:51.086
I only saw it from my own perspective.

00:43:53.047 --> 00:43:54.673
I apologize for saying…

00:43:56.717 --> 00:43:57.926
that you were running away.

00:44:22.076 --> 00:44:22.910
Here.

00:44:25.204 --> 00:44:26.205
Open it.

00:44:29.416 --> 00:44:31.543
TRAINING ABSENCE REQUEST LETTER

00:44:35.214 --> 00:44:36.131
One day,

00:44:38.384 --> 00:44:40.719
when the time comes
for you to leave the field,

00:44:43.389 --> 00:44:44.264
I hope…

00:44:46.225 --> 00:44:47.893
it's on your own terms.

00:44:54.692 --> 00:44:55.609
Be back soon.

00:45:41.029 --> 00:45:42.197
All right.

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:44.283
Kick it up a notch.

00:45:46.535 --> 00:45:48.036
Faster!

00:45:53.959 --> 00:45:55.919
Yang Seung.

00:45:57.296 --> 00:46:00.924
Let him off the hook today.
I told the opponents to go easy on him.

00:46:01.008 --> 00:46:02.342
Why can't you do it?

00:46:02.426 --> 00:46:05.804
I wish I could, but I'm the coach.

00:46:05.888 --> 00:46:08.098
Let's trust
Sangyeong Morning Soccer Club's ace.

00:46:08.182 --> 00:46:09.558
This is all your fault.

00:46:10.684 --> 00:46:13.187
Hey! You better not play!

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.275
I can't believe him.

00:46:23.071 --> 00:46:24.281
This concludes the test.

00:46:24.364 --> 00:46:25.949
Put your pen down.

00:46:29.161 --> 00:46:32.956
2025 POLICE ENTRANCE EXAM
WRITTEN EXAM

00:46:47.679 --> 00:46:49.640
YEONG-GWANG PASS!

00:46:51.058 --> 00:46:54.353
<i>I support you no matter what you decide,</i>
<i>Yeong-gwang.</i>

00:46:54.436 --> 00:46:58.398
<i>Sorry for not speaking nicely.</i>
<i>You know I didn't mean it, right?</i>

00:46:58.482 --> 00:47:00.108
<i>Let's eat something good after the test.</i>

00:47:00.192 --> 00:47:04.279
<i>Yeong-gwang, my friend.</i>
<i>Whatever you decide, you have my support.</i>

00:47:04.363 --> 00:47:05.572
<i>Sorry for messing with you.</i>

00:47:05.656 --> 00:47:08.158
<i>I hope you pass the exam</i>
<i>and make lots of money,</i>

00:47:08.242 --> 00:47:10.327
<i>so you can buy me chicken and 50 pizzas.</i>

00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:11.703
<i>From cute Seon-ho.</i>

00:47:11.787 --> 00:47:15.499
<i>Yeong-gwang, sorry for yelling at you</i>
<i>because I wanted to play the match.</i>

00:47:15.999 --> 00:47:17.209
Go, Ung!

00:47:22.506 --> 00:47:23.632
It hurts.

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:25.759
Let's give it a try!

00:47:29.638 --> 00:47:30.639
Let's go.

00:47:39.523 --> 00:47:42.484
<i>You're missing the match,</i>
<i>so I hope you do well on the test.</i>

00:47:44.152 --> 00:47:45.028
<i>I'm sorry…</i>

00:47:46.029 --> 00:47:47.030
<i>for hitting you.</i>

00:47:58.792 --> 00:48:01.253
Yeong-gwang won't be coming, will he?

00:48:03.255 --> 00:48:05.757
- You said we should let him go.
- It wasn't just me.

00:48:05.841 --> 00:48:08.677
- You wrote in the letter too.
- Because you wrote first.

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:11.638
- Don't put it on me.
- Why? Do you guys need him to play?

00:48:11.722 --> 00:48:13.181
- No.
- No.

00:48:13.265 --> 00:48:15.559
We've trained hard, haven't we?

00:48:15.642 --> 00:48:16.518
Yes.

00:48:16.602 --> 00:48:19.229
Let's give it everything we've got.

00:48:19.313 --> 00:48:20.856
- Okay.
- Yes.

00:48:23.775 --> 00:48:25.611
Hanyang!

00:48:25.694 --> 00:48:26.695
- Hanyang…
- Hey.

00:48:27.779 --> 00:48:29.197
- It's a cab.
- Is it Yeong-gwang?

00:48:29.281 --> 00:48:30.157
Hold on.

00:48:31.992 --> 00:48:32.951
Could it be…

00:48:33.035 --> 00:48:34.578
- Yeong-gwang.
- Let me see.

00:48:35.662 --> 00:48:37.080
- I think it's him.
- No way.

00:48:38.498 --> 00:48:40.459
- Aren't you going to hurry?
- Sorry.

00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:43.587
Why did they bring so many players?

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:46.423
- Why's he late?
- It's Yeong-gwang.

00:48:47.674 --> 00:48:49.926
- Hey.
- Yeong-gwang.

00:48:50.927 --> 00:48:52.679
Yeong-gwang, you came.

00:48:52.763 --> 00:48:54.348
- How?
- Yeong-gwang.

00:48:54.431 --> 00:48:55.307
You came.

00:48:57.726 --> 00:49:01.563
I don't think it's my time to leave yet.

00:49:05.859 --> 00:49:06.693
Welcome.

00:49:11.198 --> 00:49:12.699
- Oh, my goodness!
- Let's hurry!

00:49:14.284 --> 00:49:16.119
- Should we start passing?
- Get ready.

00:49:16.912 --> 00:49:17.746
You can leave.

00:49:19.373 --> 00:49:20.207
Take it easy.

00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:22.209
- Hurry.
- Pass the ball.

00:49:24.044 --> 00:49:25.587
- Stop!
- Why?

00:49:25.671 --> 00:49:27.339
- Let's see my try again.
- Come on.

00:49:28.799 --> 00:49:30.509
Wow. How'd you pull that off?

00:49:30.592 --> 00:49:32.344
That was amazing.

00:49:32.427 --> 00:49:35.514
Why are you so happy?
We lost after scoring only 12 points.

00:49:35.597 --> 00:49:37.099
Hey, that's 12 points.

00:49:37.182 --> 00:49:39.768
We scored 12 points against a pro team.

00:49:39.851 --> 00:49:43.647
Dude, how could you fail the kick
after practicing it all night long?

00:49:44.356 --> 00:49:47.234
If you'd made all the kicks,
it would have been 14 points.

00:49:49.611 --> 00:49:50.487
Still…

00:49:54.241 --> 00:49:55.283
I was touched.

00:49:56.702 --> 00:49:58.954
I was moved.

00:49:59.037 --> 00:50:00.414
Then, me too!

00:50:02.457 --> 00:50:04.042
- Seriously?
- Get off, Seon-ho.

00:50:04.126 --> 00:50:05.001
Go away. Seriously.

00:50:05.085 --> 00:50:05.961
Move, Seon-ho.

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:25.355
OK RUGBY CLUB 41:12, LOSE

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:36.908
You played hard. And…

00:50:38.744 --> 00:50:40.078
well done!

00:50:45.959 --> 00:50:50.338
Today, we scored 12 points
and lost the match.

00:50:52.174 --> 00:50:58.847
But this will be
our lowest-scoring game of the season.

00:51:01.683 --> 00:51:02.726
What's our goal?

00:51:02.809 --> 00:51:05.103
Winning the Nationals.

00:51:06.104 --> 00:51:08.690
You know we didn't pass
the preliminaries last year.

00:51:11.651 --> 00:51:12.986
You think it's impossible?

00:51:16.364 --> 00:51:18.784
I mean, I think it might be possible.

00:51:21.328 --> 00:51:22.829
We're not who we used to be.

00:51:24.289 --> 00:51:26.124
I trust you guys.

00:51:27.501 --> 00:51:31.797
So you should trust yourselves too.

00:51:36.051 --> 00:51:39.387
Let's make a miracle happen.

00:51:47.729 --> 00:51:49.689
- So cheesy.
- He's the worst.

00:51:50.774 --> 00:51:51.775
Let's do it!

00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:58.657
It was a bit cheesy, but…

00:52:01.284 --> 00:52:02.410
I mean why not…

00:52:04.079 --> 00:52:05.205
Okay. Hanyang!

00:52:05.288 --> 00:52:09.125
Hanyang!

00:52:09.209 --> 00:52:10.293
Let's go!

00:52:16.341 --> 00:52:20.804
I never thought the Rugby Team
would be able to score against a pro team.

00:52:21.596 --> 00:52:22.764
What?

00:52:22.848 --> 00:52:25.433
- Are you moved, Heung-nam?
- No.

00:52:27.185 --> 00:52:29.312
We should do something about them.

00:52:29.396 --> 00:52:31.523
It's true. They are posing a threat now.

00:52:31.606 --> 00:52:35.235
Even as someone who doesn't know rugby,
I could tell they're much better.

00:52:35.318 --> 00:52:36.570
Ga-ram, that dude.

00:52:36.653 --> 00:52:39.656
Did he get coaching training
while he was hiding or what?

00:52:39.739 --> 00:52:44.286
Right? What did he do
in those three years of hiding?

00:52:44.911 --> 00:52:47.122
- Pardon?
- Look into it, Coach Bang.

00:52:47.789 --> 00:52:51.209
Tail him or ask around,
do whatever it takes.

00:52:51.877 --> 00:52:54.254
Will that make me
the head of academic affairs?

00:52:58.758 --> 00:52:59.843
I'll look into it.

00:53:21.364 --> 00:53:23.992
- Goodness.
- You did good.

00:53:24.075 --> 00:53:26.494
Your breathing is stable. Well done.

00:53:26.578 --> 00:53:29.039
- When did you come?
- I'm not bothering you, am I?

00:53:29.122 --> 00:53:30.749
No way.

00:53:30.832 --> 00:53:32.167
I have something for you.

00:53:33.668 --> 00:53:34.586
Give me your hands.

00:53:36.504 --> 00:53:37.756
Here!

00:53:37.839 --> 00:53:40.717
What? These were discontinued.

00:53:41.384 --> 00:53:42.677
How did you get them?

00:53:42.761 --> 00:53:45.597
Now that you have these,
make sure you do well, I-ji.

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:47.724
Yes.

00:53:49.142 --> 00:53:51.645
Okay. Keep practicing. I'll get going.

00:53:51.728 --> 00:53:53.521
- Okay.
- Good luck.

00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:55.065
Thank you.

00:53:55.148 --> 00:53:56.399
Let's go!

00:53:57.108 --> 00:53:58.276
Bye.

00:54:39.275 --> 00:54:40.110
It's on.

00:54:44.447 --> 00:54:45.657
Who are you rooting for?

00:54:47.325 --> 00:54:48.201
U-jin, of course?

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.121
She's…

00:54:52.455 --> 00:54:53.540
I'm not worried about her.

00:54:56.292 --> 00:54:59.295
Between Seol-hyeon and Coach Bae,
who do you think will win?

00:54:59.379 --> 00:55:02.507
Of course, Coach Bae.
She has more experience.

00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:04.384
No, I think Seol-hyeon will win.

00:55:04.467 --> 00:55:07.429
She is overshadowed by U-jin,
but she's the runner-up.

00:55:07.512 --> 00:55:09.264
Coach Bae is well past her prime.

00:55:15.186 --> 00:55:16.855
Come on.

00:55:16.938 --> 00:55:18.732
- Yeong-gwang, seriously.
- Why'd you…

00:55:18.815 --> 00:55:20.817
He doesn't know how to read the room.

00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:22.402
- I'm serious.
- She was Coach's…

00:55:26.698 --> 00:55:27.699
Are you okay, Coach?

00:55:30.118 --> 00:55:32.078
What? Yes, I'm fine.

00:55:32.162 --> 00:55:33.121
It's starting.

00:56:11.034 --> 00:56:14.204
1. SEO U-JIN, JEONG MI-RA,
BAEK JU-YEONG, BAE I-JI

00:56:20.001 --> 00:56:21.086
4. BAE I-JI

00:56:25.924 --> 00:56:27.675
CURRENT 4TH: BAE I-JI, HANYANG HIGH

00:56:27.759 --> 00:56:29.344
Go, I-ji!

00:56:33.264 --> 00:56:34.099
Delivery.

00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:38.144
Geez, you surprised me.

00:56:38.728 --> 00:56:41.689
- Has I-ji's match started?
- She's doing great.

00:56:44.943 --> 00:56:47.195
At this rate, Seol-hyeon won't make it.

00:56:47.278 --> 00:56:50.406
5. NA SEOL-HYEON

00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:53.451
Only the top four qualify.

00:56:53.535 --> 00:56:56.037
Yes. But they're only halfway through.

00:56:56.121 --> 00:56:58.123
Seol-hyeon has time for a comeback.

00:57:00.708 --> 00:57:03.128
Coach Bae seems to be in great condition.

00:57:09.134 --> 00:57:11.261
The gap is getting wider.

00:57:16.182 --> 00:57:17.934
CURRENT 3RD: BAE I-JI, HANYANG HIGH

00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:21.354
See? I told you Coach Bae would do great.

00:57:21.438 --> 00:57:22.939
Hey, stop making a scene.

00:57:23.022 --> 00:57:24.274
The match isn't over yet.

00:57:24.357 --> 00:57:26.943
She found her momentum.
The pace will continue.

00:57:27.026 --> 00:57:31.072
- Do you want U-jin to win first place?
- Hey, what? What's with the nonsense?

00:57:31.156 --> 00:57:32.740
- Come on.
- It makes total sense.

00:57:32.824 --> 00:57:34.117
It totally makes sense.

00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:42.584
5. NA SEOL-HYEON

00:57:46.838 --> 00:57:50.175
1. SEO U-JIN, 3. BAE I-JI
5. NA SEOL-HYEON

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:16.743
Wait, I don't see Coach Bae.

00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:18.620
Has she been eliminated?

00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:21.080
No. She must have gone to the restroom.

00:58:21.164 --> 00:58:24.042
You can go out in the middle of shooting.

00:58:24.959 --> 00:58:25.960
Right?

00:58:27.587 --> 00:58:28.505
Where is Coach?

00:58:30.215 --> 00:58:31.966
He must have gone to the restroom.

00:59:02.997 --> 00:59:04.040
What are you doing?

00:59:05.708 --> 00:59:08.836
- Seol-hyeon's elimination is on you.
- I'm here as a player.

00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:10.255
So?

00:59:11.881 --> 00:59:13.925
Are you really going to beat your student?

00:59:14.759 --> 00:59:18.304
- I'm doing my best at the game--
- Stop being foolish.

00:59:19.055 --> 00:59:21.224
Do your best as a coach.

00:59:23.685 --> 00:59:25.103
Let Seol-hyeon qualify.

00:59:25.937 --> 00:59:28.356
Are you asking me to rig the game?

00:59:28.439 --> 00:59:29.774
Darn it.

00:59:29.857 --> 00:59:31.609
Don't bring up such a scary word.

00:59:34.153 --> 00:59:35.113
Anhyeon City Hall Team?

00:59:36.698 --> 00:59:40.201
Sang-a said she'd accept you
if you passed the tryout, right?

00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:43.329
But you should know.

00:59:43.413 --> 00:59:44.914
She's only a coach.

00:59:45.623 --> 00:59:47.709
The head coach and I go way back.

00:59:47.792 --> 00:59:49.877
Do you think it'll be any different there?

00:59:49.961 --> 00:59:56.009
In this small world of shooting,
burying you would be a piece of cake.

00:59:56.843 --> 00:59:58.720
Do you want this
to be your retirement match?

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:05.935
Think carefully,
unless you want to ruin your life.

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:13.735
It's all right.

01:00:18.239 --> 01:00:19.157
It's okay.

01:00:52.023 --> 01:00:52.940
Don't mind him.

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:55.818
Just focus on shooting.

01:00:59.822 --> 01:01:00.657
Focus.

01:01:40.446 --> 01:01:41.614
Ga-ram!

01:01:43.491 --> 01:01:44.909
Hey, what's wrong?

01:01:53.167 --> 01:01:55.336
4. NA SEOL-HYEON
5. BAE I-JI

01:02:10.518 --> 01:02:12.729
<i>Do you want this</i>
<i>to be your retirement match?</i>

01:02:13.688 --> 01:02:17.066
<i>But at your age, we can't take you</i>
<i>without experience on Team Korea.</i>

01:02:18.484 --> 01:02:20.278
<i>I'll call off the contract deal.</i>

01:02:22.321 --> 01:02:24.615
<i>Burying you would be a piece of cake.</i>

01:02:26.075 --> 01:02:28.578
<i>You should retire</i>
<i>before you humiliate yourself even more.</i>

01:02:30.204 --> 01:02:31.789
<i>You're done.</i>

01:02:42.717 --> 01:02:44.719
Hey, what's wrong with Coach Bae?

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:57.106
SEONGLIM HOSPITAL

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:05.865
4. NA SEOL-HYEON: COMPLETED

01:03:13.956 --> 01:03:15.374
2. SEO U-JIN: QUALIFIED

01:03:21.255 --> 01:03:22.757
What's going on?

01:03:26.093 --> 01:03:28.095
- She just has one shot left.
- Hurry!

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:22.275
4. NA SEOL-HYEON: QUALIFIED

01:04:27.822 --> 01:04:29.156
I came in fourth.

01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:24.170
EPILOGUE

01:05:57.453 --> 01:05:59.830
<i>I-ji is at a really critical moment.</i>

01:05:59.914 --> 01:06:02.291
<i>She got kicked off her pro team</i>
<i>three years ago</i>

01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:05.252
<i>after giving up the national tryouts</i>
<i>to look for you.</i>

01:06:06.045 --> 01:06:08.464
<i>This is her last year</i>
<i>as a player-coach too.</i>

01:06:08.547 --> 01:06:11.217
<i>She needs to make</i>
<i>the national team this time.</i>

01:06:11.759 --> 01:06:13.386
<i>You should help her.</i>

01:06:14.887 --> 01:06:18.432
SHOOTING TEAM

01:07:00.808 --> 01:07:03.978
THE WINNING TRY

01:07:04.061 --> 01:07:05.688 line:20%
<i>The Presidents Cup is approaching.</i>

01:07:05.771 --> 01:07:08.482 line:20%
<i>Coach Ju is practically shunned</i>
<i>in the rugby world.</i>

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:11.318 line:20%
<i>No scout is going to watch</i>
<i>Hanyang High's match.</i>

01:07:11.402 --> 01:07:12.987 line:20%
We'll make them come somehow.

01:07:14.822 --> 01:07:16.323 line:20%
We are strong!

01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:18.534 line:20%

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:35.176 line:20%
I don't know what you're hiding,
but hide it well.

01:07:35.259 --> 01:07:36.510 line:20%
