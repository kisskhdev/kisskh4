WEBVTT

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:14.741
Well, is there a problem?

00:01:16.952 --> 00:01:19.413
I'm still currently handling
Moon Chanyeong's case.

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:20.497
Right.

00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:25.669
Isn't it a bit much to assign me a case

00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:28.463
to defend a perpetrator
of school violence?

00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:34.261
Who are you to turn down cases?

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:36.638
- I know I'm just an associate, but...
- No.

00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:38.807
I mean aside from that.

00:01:41.727 --> 00:01:44.146
You're a lawyer.
You don't get to cherry-pick cases.

00:01:46.982 --> 00:01:48.442
Perpetrators can't be defended?

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:50.402
Yes. They can, but…

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.907
But right now, I'm representing
a victim of school violence.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.826
Could you at least not give
both cases at the same time?

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:00.996
Do you defend your clients

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:03.707
with your feelings?

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:08.170
It seems you have it all wrong.

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:10.797
A lawyer's job is to translate

00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:13.175
what a client wants to say
into legal terms.

00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:14.259
That's it.

00:02:14.343 --> 00:02:15.427
We're just technicians.

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:19.616
So you take cases on opposing sides
at the same time?

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.891
What does it matter?

00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:52.548
Episode 10
Difference in Perspective

00:03:17.281 --> 00:03:18.407
Let's do our best today.

00:03:20.117 --> 00:03:21.118
Okay.

00:03:25.247 --> 00:03:27.791
Because this could be my last case.

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:35.090
SEOUL POLICE STATION

00:03:35.174 --> 00:03:39.052
I've read over the statement you sent,
Attorney Cho.

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:40.179
Mr. Moon Chanyeong?

00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:42.681
- Yes?
- Do you admit to the charge?

00:03:49.188 --> 00:03:50.189
Yes.

00:03:51.106 --> 00:03:54.359
He's trying to say
he admits to the stabbing,

00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:56.278
but he's not pleading guilty.

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:57.905
Yes, I understand.

00:03:57.988 --> 00:04:01.325
You explained it very thoroughly
in your statement,

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:03.493
so I get what you mean.

00:04:04.328 --> 00:04:05.871
What happened to the victim?

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:07.539
The kid who got stabbed?

00:04:07.623 --> 00:04:09.625
- Yes.
- He's fine.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.586
I mean, he wasn't stabbed anywhere vital.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.175
But calling it self-defense…

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:20.302
You know how tricky that is.

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.721
The issue is,

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:24.306
it wasn't just self-defense.

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:25.807
It was more like an attack.

00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:29.478
There are precedents that recognize
aggressive retaliation as self-defense.

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:31.480
The bullying went on for a long time.

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:33.857
We can't say the moment
Kim Jeongmin took out the knife

00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:35.692
was the only time Chanyeong was attacked.

00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:38.946
We've had a lot
of internal discussions too,

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:41.907
but we decided
to send it over for indictment.

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:44.368
We couldn't have just dropped it.

00:04:46.495 --> 00:04:48.014
Because it's an attempted murder case.

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:50.207
Kim Jeongmin had already
stopped attacking too.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.291
No.

00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:53.252
His attack wasn't over.

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:55.045
What if he had picked up the knife first?

00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:59.341
Or if Chanyeong grabbed it
and Jeongmin took it from him?

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:04.137
The violence went on for two years.
It wasn't just kids joking around.

00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:09.142
I have a kid too,

00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:12.646
so honestly,
I didn't want to do this either.

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:19.319
But I'll submit your statement
to the prosecution,

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:21.405
so go home and wait.

00:05:21.989 --> 00:05:24.324
You never know.
They may decide not to indict.

00:05:43.427 --> 00:05:44.887
Excuse me, where's Munjeong...

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.806
- Which area is Bae Munjeong in?
- Just a moment, sir.

00:05:54.438 --> 00:05:56.190
You can go to Yellow Zone Number 2.

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:58.192
Yellow…

00:06:02.905 --> 00:06:03.906
Munjeong.

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:05.908
Are you okay?

00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:08.285
There's a lot of other patients here.
Quiet down.

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:11.038
What did they say?
Are you going to be okay?

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:13.582
I don't know.

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:16.251
Bae Munjeong?

00:06:16.335 --> 00:06:17.461
You must be her guardian.

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:19.379
- How's the baby?
- How is my wife?

00:06:20.047 --> 00:06:21.131
Let me take a look.

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:24.134
Your uterus grows
as you enter the second trimester,

00:06:24.218 --> 00:06:25.802
so you may have stomach tightening.

00:06:26.345 --> 00:06:28.639
When that happens,
it's best to relax your body

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:30.140
and get some rest.

00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:32.002
I'll take a look at your stomach.

00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:35.414
If it feels tight for over 20 minutes,

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:37.648
or if it happens more regularly,

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:40.025
it could lead to contractions.

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:41.902
In that case,
come straight to the hospital.

00:06:42.486 --> 00:06:43.779
And don't go anywhere alone.

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:45.906
Make sure to always be with your guardian.

00:06:46.657 --> 00:06:47.658
Okay. Gel, please.

00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:51.703
Okay, we'll take a look.

00:07:01.547 --> 00:07:02.548
The baby's doing well.

00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:04.174
He's a strong one.

00:07:06.468 --> 00:07:07.469
Don't worry.

00:07:07.553 --> 00:07:10.931
Once you get all of the muscle relaxant,
you're good to go home.

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:12.975
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:07:29.575 --> 00:07:31.410
Don't cry. He said you're fine.

00:07:32.536 --> 00:07:33.537
I'm not crying.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.259
I don't think it's right to split
the corporate tax based on revenue.

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:50.929
That means even firms not making profits
would have to pitch in,

00:07:51.013 --> 00:07:52.389
and that's not fair.

00:07:53.015 --> 00:07:55.851
I also agree with what Ms. Kang said.

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:57.895
The numbers we calculated separately

00:07:57.978 --> 00:08:02.691
keep clashing
with the total net profit after taxes.

00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:03.901
That's the issue.

00:08:05.027 --> 00:08:07.070
Let's keep it simple and go by revenue.

00:08:07.154 --> 00:08:10.908
Breaking down and calculating expenses
for each firm is tough.

00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:13.911
Even if it's difficult,
doing proper calculations

00:08:13.994 --> 00:08:16.038
will be better in the long term.

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:18.248
Just how long term are you even thinking?

00:08:18.332 --> 00:08:20.792
Are you in the red?
Is this to avoid the corporate tax?

00:08:20.876 --> 00:08:22.336
How could you say that?

00:08:22.419 --> 00:08:24.963
Let's just do things
the easy way, okay? Geez.

00:08:25.047 --> 00:08:26.757
You're pushing to go by revenue,

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.302
- because it benefits you this year.
- Is that not allowed?

00:08:31.345 --> 00:08:33.263
You're also pushing
for what benefits you.

00:08:33.347 --> 00:08:35.724
All I'm saying is
we should do it properly.

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:38.685
Well, we don't have an accountant.

00:08:38.769 --> 00:08:40.938
Tracking expenses is a pain,
so handle it yourself.

00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:43.815
Don't just shrug it off
so irresponsibly like that.

00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:46.235
At this rate,
we'll never be able to wrap this up.

00:08:46.318 --> 00:08:47.319
Let's…

00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:49.363
Set the criteria again.

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:50.926
What have we been talking about then?

00:09:06.255 --> 00:09:07.297
Yes?

00:09:08.507 --> 00:09:11.301
I need you to go over these too.

00:09:11.385 --> 00:09:13.679
We suddenly received
five lawsuits all at once.

00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:15.013
Okay, ma'am.

00:09:15.097 --> 00:09:17.599
You're very busy, right?
I'll tell them to throw in a bonus.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:19.351
It's okay.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:24.731
Is something wrong?

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:27.401
No, nothing's wrong.

00:09:31.113 --> 00:09:32.114
Okay.

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:33.907
Let's hang in there.

00:09:34.533 --> 00:09:35.534
Yes, ma'am.

00:09:42.374 --> 00:09:46.587
The defendant must respond diligently
to the request for clarification.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:50.883
The next hearing will be held here

00:09:50.966 --> 00:09:55.179
on May 15th, 2025 at 2:10 p.m.

00:09:57.514 --> 00:09:59.808
We will proceed with the next case.

00:09:59.892 --> 00:10:03.979
Civil case number 2025-2736.

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:12.988
Who are in attendance today?

00:10:13.572 --> 00:10:16.617
Attorney Kang Jeongyun
from Law Group Hyungmin.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.786
Attorney Seong Yudeok
from Law Group Hyungmin.

00:10:20.621 --> 00:10:21.663
What?

00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:25.209
First, have a seat.

00:10:26.877 --> 00:10:27.920
What's going on?

00:10:28.837 --> 00:10:31.215
Did you submit
the wrong power of attorney forms?

00:10:31.298 --> 00:10:33.342
- You're the plaintiff's counsel?
- Yes, Your Honor.

00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:35.886
- And you're the defendant's counsel?
- Yes, that's right.

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:37.889
It's a conflict of interest.
Neither of you knew?

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:39.491
A LAW FIRM CANNOT REPRESENT BOTH SIDES

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.350
No.

00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:42.434
Well, first of all…

00:10:43.018 --> 00:10:45.479
Let's postpone today's hearing.

00:10:46.063 --> 00:10:47.898
Please have this sorted out.

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:49.733
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Yes, Your Honor.

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:52.236
We'll move on to the next trial.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.368
You should withdraw, Mr. Seong.

00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:01.870
- You should withdraw.
- We're the plaintiff.

00:11:02.454 --> 00:11:04.915
The case started
when we filed the complaint.

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:07.960
The defendant likely hired counsel
after receiving it.

00:11:08.043 --> 00:11:10.170
Chronologically, we were first.

00:11:10.254 --> 00:11:13.715
The plaintiff kept threatening to sue,

00:11:14.216 --> 00:11:17.052
so we were hired in advance
before the complaint came in.

00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:18.428
When were you hired?

00:11:18.512 --> 00:11:20.639
- Last winter.
- We were hired last fall.

00:11:23.976 --> 00:11:25.561
I meant late fall. Winter came early.

00:11:25.644 --> 00:11:28.730
How do you know your client?
I know mine well. You should withdraw.

00:11:28.814 --> 00:11:31.275
Then, it'll be easier on you
to ask for their understanding.

00:11:33.861 --> 00:11:36.572
How much was your retainer?
Let the cheaper one withdraw.

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.741
That's not how this works.

00:11:42.494 --> 00:11:43.996
Your rate must be pretty low.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.874
You folded before we even discussed it.

00:11:46.957 --> 00:11:48.333
If I withdraw,

00:11:48.834 --> 00:11:50.377
will you split the retainer?

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.588
- No, why would I?
- Exactly.

00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:54.214
The retainer doesn't matter.

00:11:54.298 --> 00:11:57.092
The one who was hired later
should withdraw.

00:11:59.344 --> 00:12:00.387
No way.

00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:18.530
I didn't hit him.

00:12:19.615 --> 00:12:20.616
It was just a joke.

00:12:22.868 --> 00:12:25.037
What, guys can't joke around a little?

00:12:29.458 --> 00:12:31.043
And what do you think, sir?

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:32.753
My son says…

00:12:34.588 --> 00:12:35.964
He did nothing wrong.

00:12:39.635 --> 00:12:40.636
Are you claiming

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.138
- that you're innocent?
- Yes.

00:12:43.222 --> 00:12:45.307
Dad, didn't you tell him in advance?

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:47.392
So Attorney Cho…

00:12:49.895 --> 00:12:51.230
Can you get him off the hook?

00:12:51.772 --> 00:12:53.106
He isn't innocent though.

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.651
You have to make that happen as my lawyer.

00:12:55.734 --> 00:12:57.819
I'll pay you a fat retainer.

00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:00.489
Son, just relax. It's okay.

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:02.449
It was just a joke, right?

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:07.788
Can we get some sides here?

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:15.128
Is Munjeong going to be okay?

00:13:15.796 --> 00:13:17.965
I talked to her on the way out.
She's fine now.

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:22.719
I wish she could take a few days off.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.097
- Isn't she busy with a bunch of trials?
- Yeah.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.057
I can take on a few of her cases.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.143
Let me know if you need help.
I owe Munjeong too.

00:13:30.227 --> 00:13:31.478
Yeah.

00:13:31.562 --> 00:13:34.356
- Let me know if you need me.
- It's fine. I have it covered.

00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:39.236
- Did you get a perm?
- It looks nice, right?

00:13:39.862 --> 00:13:40.988
Yeah.

00:13:41.864 --> 00:13:44.074
Right. Did you hear
that my boss and your boss

00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:45.909
ran into each other in court?

00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:48.537
No, I didn't.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.081
They were on opposing sides
of the same case.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:52.791
What? A conflict of interest?

00:13:52.875 --> 00:13:54.668
- Yeah.
- He really takes just any case.

00:13:55.878 --> 00:13:57.379
Who agreed to withdraw?

00:13:57.462 --> 00:13:58.839
Mine would never back out.

00:13:58.922 --> 00:14:01.216
Mine's not one to cave that easily either.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.179
Clients from both sides heard
and couldn't trust them, so they canceled.

00:14:05.262 --> 00:14:06.462
They're both off the case now.

00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:08.098
Geez, serves you right.

00:14:10.225 --> 00:14:12.269
Not your boss. Mine.

00:14:21.153 --> 00:14:22.696
- Bye.
- Bye. Get home safe.

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:23.947
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

00:14:30.662 --> 00:14:32.372
What happened? What's wrong?

00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:34.499
It's nothing.

00:14:36.502 --> 00:14:38.420
Is the school violence case
not going well?

00:14:40.422 --> 00:14:41.423
No, it's not that.

00:14:42.466 --> 00:14:44.259
I took on another school violence case.

00:14:45.302 --> 00:14:47.513
This time, I'm defending the perpetrator.

00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:49.681
Gosh, some things never change.

00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:52.100
Hey, that's just how Mr. Seong is.

00:14:52.184 --> 00:14:53.602
Just keep it strictly business.

00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:56.571
Says the one
who couldn't stand him and left.

00:14:56.647 --> 00:14:58.065
I only left

00:14:59.149 --> 00:15:01.276
because I was offered more money.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.780
So? Are you happy
now that you earn more?

00:15:07.741 --> 00:15:09.952
I have to be happy!

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:24.675
Pull an all-nighter because of me?

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:26.802
Why are you already back?
I told you to rest.

00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:28.262
Forget it. I'm fine.

00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:32.307
Hey. If things are hard, say it.
Don't just say you're fine.

00:15:32.391 --> 00:15:33.767
I am fine.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.273
Want me to get you a coffee?
You said decaf's okay, right?

00:15:39.982 --> 00:15:41.942
You've learned a lot
from your girlfriend.

00:15:42.943 --> 00:15:44.736
I'll buy coffee later.

00:15:52.953 --> 00:15:55.622
- Ms. Jang, could you submit this for me?
- Yes? Sure.

00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.718
JOB LISTING DETAILS
HIRING EXPERIENCED LAWYER

00:16:00.752 --> 00:16:02.838
Well, this isn't…

00:16:03.672 --> 00:16:06.842
He didn't say to upload it now.
He said to just get it ready.

00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:10.012
I was just going to save it for now.

00:16:10.512 --> 00:16:12.222
MANAGING PARTNER
NA KYUNGMIN

00:16:19.021 --> 00:16:20.439
Hey, there.

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:22.566
Are you feeling okay?

00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:25.611
- Are you planning to post a job listing?
- Oh, that?

00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:28.572
I told them to have
something ready just in case.

00:16:29.072 --> 00:16:31.158
It's just to have some resumes on hand.

00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:34.077
- Are you hiring my replacement?
- We're not hiring right away.

00:16:34.161 --> 00:16:36.747
- We don't know what will happen with you.
- Exactly.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.208
We don't know, so why jump the gun?

00:16:40.459 --> 00:16:42.419
- Are you telling me to leave?
- No.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.047
Don't think of it that way.

00:16:45.631 --> 00:16:47.174
I'm just worried. That's all.

00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:49.510
I'm still good enough to work.

00:16:49.593 --> 00:16:52.221
If something comes up, I'll let you know.

00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:54.848
Until then, you don't have to worry.

00:17:03.315 --> 00:17:05.484
My goodness, you're back.

00:17:06.443 --> 00:17:07.444
Yes.

00:17:07.986 --> 00:17:08.987
Attorney Cho.

00:17:09.988 --> 00:17:11.073
What's written here…

00:17:12.366 --> 00:17:13.534
Is this correct?

00:17:13.617 --> 00:17:15.077
Yes, it is.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.578
You want the charges dropped?

00:17:18.247 --> 00:17:19.373
Yes.

00:17:20.791 --> 00:17:22.584
But the evidence is pretty solid.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:24.920
To say it wasn't assault at all,

00:17:26.255 --> 00:17:27.381
that's a little…

00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:33.929
It may look like assault
just from the photos.

00:17:36.056 --> 00:17:37.057
But…

00:17:38.225 --> 00:17:40.894
It was just a result
of kids joking around.

00:17:43.105 --> 00:17:44.273
Kids joking around?

00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:49.736
Yes. And apparently,
that student tends to get bruises easily.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:05.127
LAW GROUP HYUNGMIN

00:18:06.336 --> 00:18:07.838
- Attorney Cho.
- Yes?

00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:10.340
The result
of Moon Chanyeong's case arrived.

00:18:10.424 --> 00:18:11.675
I put it on your desk.

00:18:11.758 --> 00:18:13.343
Okay, thank you.

00:18:23.187 --> 00:18:24.354
Damn it.

00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:37.451
RESULT OF DECISION
INDICTED WITHOUT DETENTION

00:18:42.664 --> 00:18:44.583
MOON CHANYEONG

00:18:56.053 --> 00:18:57.054
Attorney Cho.

00:18:58.263 --> 00:18:59.264
Yes?

00:19:00.224 --> 00:19:02.142
Does this mean I'm going to jail now?

00:19:05.604 --> 00:19:08.524
An indictment just means
the case is going to trial.

00:19:08.607 --> 00:19:10.150
It doesn't mean you're guilty.

00:19:10.234 --> 00:19:11.318
Are you still…

00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:14.363
Going to argue self-defense?

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:20.911
About that…

00:19:21.703 --> 00:19:24.915
I'm thinking about
what would be best for you.

00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:27.835
What would you like to do?

00:19:30.128 --> 00:19:31.171
I know…

00:19:33.841 --> 00:19:35.843
That I did something wrong.

00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:38.053
But…

00:19:41.098 --> 00:19:44.101
Still, it's so unfair.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.398
Attorney Cho, I'm so scared.

00:19:50.566 --> 00:19:52.734
I don't want to go to jail.

00:20:19.303 --> 00:20:22.014
I heard there were disagreements
about the corporate tax,

00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:23.974
so I had it sorted out.

00:20:28.437 --> 00:20:29.688
First of all, the amount paid

00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:33.275
will be based on the net profit
calculated by each firm.

00:20:33.859 --> 00:20:35.861
Going by revenue is much simpler though.

00:20:37.905 --> 00:20:40.157
For expenses used on
entertaining or golf with guests,

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.744
if there were no records of who it was for
and how they were entertained,

00:20:43.827 --> 00:20:45.096
they weren't counted as expenses.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.622
I'm on board with this.

00:20:47.289 --> 00:20:48.999
And on the last page,

00:20:49.082 --> 00:20:52.419
you'll see the amount of corporate tax
that each firm has to pay.

00:20:53.128 --> 00:20:55.714
Take a look,
and if there are no major issues,

00:20:55.797 --> 00:20:57.549
we'll move forward with this.

00:20:57.633 --> 00:21:00.010
- Okay, then…
- It looks good.

00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:02.804
- Let's go with it.
- Yes, sounds good to me.

00:21:02.888 --> 00:21:03.889
All right, then.

00:21:06.016 --> 00:21:09.353
Will we be able to afford
to do this next year too?

00:21:09.436 --> 00:21:11.104
We lost a case for nothing.

00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:13.482
The feeling is mutual.

00:21:15.192 --> 00:21:16.944
Just a heads-up here.

00:21:17.027 --> 00:21:18.779
If a similar situation occurs next time,

00:21:18.862 --> 00:21:21.114
I won't be backing down.

00:21:23.075 --> 00:21:25.869
I knew merging
wouldn't be all positives.

00:21:25.953 --> 00:21:27.788
But still, it's been trying in many ways.

00:21:36.755 --> 00:21:39.299
This merger was decided on by all of you.

00:21:43.971 --> 00:21:46.557
As you know,
revenue has increased significantly.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:53.272
I'm aware of the issues
the merger has caused.

00:21:53.939 --> 00:21:57.401
If there's anything I can help with,
don't hesitate to let me know.

00:21:57.484 --> 00:21:58.485
Okay.

00:22:13.208 --> 00:22:15.002
<i>It's just to have some resumes on hand.</i>

00:22:15.085 --> 00:22:17.087
We don't know what will happen with you.

00:22:33.061 --> 00:22:34.730
I HOPE WE CAN BE FRIENDS

00:22:44.072 --> 00:22:45.324
MIN JEONGIN

00:23:18.232 --> 00:23:19.733
Munjeong!

00:23:20.859 --> 00:23:22.152
It's been too long.

00:23:23.862 --> 00:23:25.572
How long has it been?

00:23:25.656 --> 00:23:26.782
Right?

00:23:27.407 --> 00:23:28.867
You look great.

00:23:28.951 --> 00:23:29.952
Really?

00:23:30.452 --> 00:23:31.995
I've been feeling off lately.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.623
What are you talking about?

00:23:34.706 --> 00:23:37.334
You look way better
than when you were an in-house counsel.

00:23:37.417 --> 00:23:42.130
Back then, you always looked drained,
like a fish with dead eyes.

00:23:43.257 --> 00:23:44.258
I agree.

00:23:45.759 --> 00:23:47.511
I guess litigation suits you.

00:23:47.594 --> 00:23:49.096
You look great too.

00:23:49.179 --> 00:23:50.597
Me?

00:23:51.139 --> 00:23:53.767
I'm just your average working mom now.

00:23:54.601 --> 00:23:57.062
Do you feel more relaxed
than when you did litigation?

00:23:57.729 --> 00:23:59.523
How's the vibe of the legal team here?

00:23:59.606 --> 00:24:01.006
You've done it before, so you know.

00:24:01.567 --> 00:24:03.902
It's a whole different world
from Seocho-dong.

00:24:05.571 --> 00:24:07.239
But here,

00:24:08.407 --> 00:24:11.910
I can come in and leave with my kid,
and that's nice.

00:24:12.828 --> 00:24:15.247
- They go to your company's daycare, right?
- Yeah.

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:16.874
At what month did they start going?

00:24:17.374 --> 00:24:19.793
Did you go back to work
right after giving birth?

00:24:22.754 --> 00:24:23.755
Are you pregnant?

00:24:24.548 --> 00:24:25.591
- Yes.
- My gosh!

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:27.301
My goodness!

00:24:29.761 --> 00:24:33.098
- Congratulations! That's amazing!
- Thanks.

00:24:34.016 --> 00:24:36.768
You must have a lot on your mind, right?

00:24:36.852 --> 00:24:37.853
Yeah.

00:24:40.522 --> 00:24:41.940
By the way,

00:24:42.024 --> 00:24:45.402
how do you take maternity
or parental leave here?

00:24:49.573 --> 00:24:53.535
Counsel, are you maintaining
the claim of self-defense?

00:24:54.036 --> 00:24:55.037
Yes, Your Honor.

00:24:56.371 --> 00:24:57.372
All right.

00:24:57.956 --> 00:24:59.833
We'll conclude the evidence review.

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:04.296
Would you like to question
the defendant, Counsel?

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.805
Yes, Your Honor.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:24.024
COUNSEL'S SEAT, DEFENDANT'S SEAT

00:25:27.653 --> 00:25:29.530
Mr. Moon, what grade are you in right now?

00:25:30.864 --> 00:25:32.241
I'm a senior in high school.

00:25:32.783 --> 00:25:35.285
It's pretty rare
to transfer schools as a senior.

00:25:36.036 --> 00:25:37.704
What caused you to transfer?

00:25:39.331 --> 00:25:40.415
I was bullied…

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:45.629
For over a year.

00:25:45.712 --> 00:25:47.172
PROSECUTOR'S SEAT

00:25:47.256 --> 00:25:50.509
It became too hard to keep attending,
so you transferred, correct?

00:25:53.262 --> 00:25:54.263
Yes.

00:25:56.515 --> 00:25:58.767
What is the name of the student
who bullied you?

00:26:01.019 --> 00:26:04.356
It's Kim Jeongmin.

00:26:06.483 --> 00:26:09.945
When Kim Jeongmin showed up
at your new school,

00:26:10.654 --> 00:26:12.447
how did that make you feel?

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.545
"This is never going to end."

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.300
Even if I reported him…

00:26:33.385 --> 00:26:34.803
Even if he got punished…

00:26:36.889 --> 00:26:40.142
Even if he got expelled
and I transferred schools…

00:26:43.353 --> 00:26:44.855
I knew it wasn't going to end.

00:26:47.691 --> 00:26:49.193
<i>When Kim Jeongmin came</i>

00:26:50.027 --> 00:26:52.446
<i>and held a knife up to you,</i>

00:26:52.529 --> 00:26:55.282
you fought back for the first time
and the knife fell, correct?

00:26:57.910 --> 00:26:59.328
Yes, that's correct.

00:26:59.828 --> 00:27:04.625
You stated you grabbed the knife
because you felt you had to get it first.

00:27:05.834 --> 00:27:08.003
What was going through your mind
in that moment?

00:27:26.438 --> 00:27:27.606
"I want to live."

00:27:32.819 --> 00:27:34.071
"I don't want to die."

00:27:37.866 --> 00:27:38.992
At that moment,

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.787
if the one who grabbed the knife first

00:27:42.996 --> 00:27:45.916
was him and not you,
what would've happened?

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:50.295
I wouldn't be here right now.

00:27:59.847 --> 00:28:00.967
Nothing further, Your Honor.

00:28:04.059 --> 00:28:07.396
Would the prosecutor
like to cross-examine?

00:28:09.106 --> 00:28:10.107
No, Your Honor.

00:28:10.983 --> 00:28:13.652
All right.
Defendant, please return to your seat.

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:25.497
Prosecutor, state your sentencing request.

00:28:28.208 --> 00:28:29.293
We request

00:28:30.169 --> 00:28:34.131
a sentence of one year and three months,
suspended for two years.

00:28:39.636 --> 00:28:41.471
You're requesting a suspended sentence?

00:28:42.097 --> 00:28:44.308
Yes, Your Honor.
Based on all of the circumstances,

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:47.561
we're requesting probation.

00:28:49.897 --> 00:28:51.648
Okay, I understand.

00:29:05.037 --> 00:29:06.580
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:29:06.663 --> 00:29:07.664
Okay.

00:29:09.499 --> 00:29:11.710
Attorney Ahn,
I need you for a consult later.

00:29:11.793 --> 00:29:13.003
Okay, sir.

00:29:22.471 --> 00:29:24.556
- It just got rescheduled to tomorrow.
- Okay.

00:29:33.232 --> 00:29:34.525
FAMILY RELATIONS CERTIFICATE

00:29:34.608 --> 00:29:37.528
I requested a family registry
for the first time in a while.

00:29:37.611 --> 00:29:39.905
It turns out our father had passed away.

00:29:40.781 --> 00:29:42.783
- And you weren't aware?
- No.

00:29:43.367 --> 00:29:46.828
Our parents divorced 20 years ago,
and we've had no contact with him since.

00:29:47.996 --> 00:29:53.085
I didn't feel great about it,
so I got in touch with our relatives.

00:29:53.585 --> 00:29:55.546
Apparently, he passed
less than a month ago.

00:29:56.421 --> 00:29:57.422
And…

00:30:04.012 --> 00:30:06.974
You two hadn't heard
about your father this whole time?

00:30:07.057 --> 00:30:08.100
No.

00:30:08.767 --> 00:30:11.270
We weren't in contact with him
after the divorce.

00:30:12.145 --> 00:30:15.357
It's been over 20 years
since we heard from him.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.484
Then, you probably
don't even know he remarried.

00:30:22.072 --> 00:30:23.365
Hyeonwoo!

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:27.995
Say hello.

00:30:28.078 --> 00:30:29.496
Hello.

00:30:32.332 --> 00:30:33.333
Hi.

00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:37.838
<i>It felt a little strange.</i>

00:30:37.921 --> 00:30:41.258
Our parents got divorced
when we were about his age.

00:30:41.341 --> 00:30:45.762
His second wife passed away last year
from a chronic illness.

00:30:45.846 --> 00:30:48.515
Our father passed away
from cancer this year.

00:30:49.308 --> 00:30:53.520
In a case like this,
are we still included in the inheritance?

00:30:54.646 --> 00:30:58.275
Yes, you are still legal heirs
despite the divorce and living separately.

00:30:58.358 --> 00:31:01.904
Right now, it's the two of you
and this child, so it's three joint heirs.

00:31:02.821 --> 00:31:03.822
I see.

00:31:05.157 --> 00:31:07.075
Then, we'll need to take action too.

00:31:10.037 --> 00:31:12.831
From what we found,
he had a lot more debt than assets.

00:31:13.707 --> 00:31:16.710
In that case,
can we just renounce the inheritance?

00:31:18.754 --> 00:31:21.089
It's been less than a month
since he passed,

00:31:21.173 --> 00:31:22.674
so you can file for renunciation.

00:31:23.634 --> 00:31:25.802
It is possible, but…

00:31:32.142 --> 00:31:34.269
Never mind. Renouncing is the best option.

00:31:34.353 --> 00:31:36.730
Okay, let's go ahead with that.

00:31:37.314 --> 00:31:38.440
Okay, then.

00:31:47.241 --> 00:31:48.992
Once you renounce,
isn't that the end of it?

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:52.621
Technically, yes.
But I'm just worried about the kid.

00:31:53.372 --> 00:31:57.793
If my clients renounce,
all that debt goes over to him.

00:31:57.876 --> 00:32:00.712
- He can't renounce his inheritance?
- No.

00:32:01.338 --> 00:32:04.758
When all the children renounce,
the siblings are next in line.

00:32:05.801 --> 00:32:10.722
But one of them is the child's guardian,
and they'd have to renounce for him.

00:32:11.223 --> 00:32:14.268
If they do that, the debt shifts to them.
So chances are, they won't.

00:32:16.979 --> 00:32:19.773
- You want it done for the kid too, right?
- Yes.

00:32:21.441 --> 00:32:23.193
Getting consent from them won't be easy.

00:32:23.277 --> 00:32:27.739
Goodness. I renounced my inheritance
when my dad passed too.

00:32:28.991 --> 00:32:32.077
Tracking everyone down
one by one was no joke.

00:32:47.593 --> 00:32:49.178
The verdict comes out today, right?

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:52.139
- Yeah, at 2:00 p.m.
- What do you think?

00:32:55.726 --> 00:32:57.019
No idea.

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:20.083
Ms. Kim, did Chanyeong
go to hear the verdict?

00:33:20.167 --> 00:33:22.169
Yes, with our office manager.

00:33:22.252 --> 00:33:23.754
Did his grandmother go too?

00:33:23.837 --> 00:33:25.797
No, he went alone.

00:33:27.549 --> 00:33:28.800
Is that so?

00:33:47.236 --> 00:33:48.946
You're Moon Chanyeong's attorney, right?

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:51.448
Yes, Your Honor.

00:33:52.366 --> 00:33:53.700
Please come join your client.

00:34:06.922 --> 00:34:08.465
Defendant Moon Chanyeong.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.801
Yes?

00:34:12.135 --> 00:34:13.762
Before I read the verdict,

00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:18.267
I want to say this was
a difficult case for us as well.

00:34:19.309 --> 00:34:22.229
We recognize the defendant
was a victim of school violence.

00:34:23.438 --> 00:34:26.275
And we agree
the plaintiff Kim Jeongmin's aggression

00:34:26.358 --> 00:34:27.860
was ongoing as well.

00:34:29.361 --> 00:34:31.113
This means

00:34:31.196 --> 00:34:34.074
we recognize the element of immediacy
that justifies self-defense.

00:34:36.368 --> 00:34:37.703
However,

00:34:38.245 --> 00:34:41.164
in regards to the act of stabbing
Kim Jeongmin with a knife,

00:34:42.082 --> 00:34:43.834
we cannot say

00:34:44.585 --> 00:34:46.753
it meets the standard

00:34:47.421 --> 00:34:50.007
of social acceptability
as a means of defense.

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:51.091
Therefore,

00:34:51.842 --> 00:34:54.428
we cannot accept
the claim of self-defense.

00:34:58.932 --> 00:34:59.933
That said,

00:35:00.392 --> 00:35:03.437
since even the prosecution
has requested a suspended sentence,

00:35:03.979 --> 00:35:05.230
it's clear that all parties

00:35:05.731 --> 00:35:08.025
have taken the circumstances
of this case into account.

00:35:08.859 --> 00:35:10.652
We will now deliver the verdict.

00:35:14.114 --> 00:35:18.118
The defendant Moon Chanyeong is sentenced
to one year and three months in prison.

00:35:18.744 --> 00:35:21.830
However, this sentence
will be suspended for two years

00:35:21.914 --> 00:35:24.458
from the date of the ruling.

00:35:34.134 --> 00:35:35.344
You did well.

00:35:36.345 --> 00:35:38.222
Thank you, sir. Thank you so much.

00:35:39.806 --> 00:35:40.974
PROSECUTOR'S SEAT

00:36:04.081 --> 00:36:06.333
<i>Who wants dinner? It's on me.</i>

00:36:09.169 --> 00:36:10.170
<i>Me.</i>

00:36:19.555 --> 00:36:22.724
That's amazing. Well done, Cho Changwon.

00:36:24.101 --> 00:36:27.271
No. All the credit goes to the prosecutor.

00:36:27.771 --> 00:36:29.356
I mean, I fought for my client.

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:32.442
But it's not easy
for a prosecutor to go that far.

00:36:36.613 --> 00:36:39.783
Hey. What would you have been
if you hadn't become a lawyer?

00:36:42.119 --> 00:36:44.037
- Why ask that all of a sudden?
- Well…

00:36:44.705 --> 00:36:46.039
I was honestly surprised.

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:49.126
Ever see a suspended sentence request
for attempted murder?

00:36:49.209 --> 00:36:50.544
Nope.

00:36:50.627 --> 00:36:53.255
I've never seen it
for even lesser charges.

00:36:53.338 --> 00:36:54.506
Exactly.

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:56.425
Even the judge looked surprised.

00:36:57.134 --> 00:36:58.719
So, it made me think.

00:37:00.971 --> 00:37:04.016
If I were the prosecutor,
could I have done that?

00:37:14.526 --> 00:37:17.321
I mean, did you ever
want to be something else?

00:37:18.322 --> 00:37:19.364
Well…

00:37:20.866 --> 00:37:22.159
I did, but I decided not to.

00:37:22.242 --> 00:37:23.285
What was it?

00:37:23.869 --> 00:37:25.579
I'm not doing it, so why tell you?

00:37:25.662 --> 00:37:28.832
- Come on, what was it? Tell me.
- I don't want to!

00:37:28.916 --> 00:37:30.334
- You don't want to?
- No.

00:37:30.417 --> 00:37:32.169
Then, take a hike.

00:37:35.464 --> 00:37:37.174
- Are you crazy?
- Cheers.

00:37:50.521 --> 00:37:52.689
<i>I'm heading to prison now.</i>

00:37:52.773 --> 00:37:54.608
<i>Was there a reason you became a lawyer?</i>

00:37:55.192 --> 00:37:57.152
You just kept studying
and ended up as one.

00:37:57.236 --> 00:37:58.904
<i>A lawyer's job is to translate</i>

00:37:58.987 --> 00:38:01.073
<i>what a client wants to say
into legal terms.</i>

00:38:01.156 --> 00:38:03.158
That's it. We're just technicians.

00:38:03.742 --> 00:38:05.410
<i>You're requesting a suspended sentence?</i>

00:38:05.494 --> 00:38:07.829
Yes, Your Honor.
Based on all of the circumstances,

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:10.666
we're requesting probation.

2025 PROSECUTOR APPLICATION GUIDE
FOR EXPERIENCED PROFESSIONALS

00:38:43.699 --> 00:38:45.033
What is your name?

00:38:45.117 --> 00:38:46.827
Shin Jihye.

00:38:47.411 --> 00:38:48.787
Okay. What can I do for you?

00:38:48.871 --> 00:38:50.372
My husband is dead.

00:38:55.794 --> 00:38:56.795
What happened?

00:38:58.463 --> 00:38:59.548
He took his own life.

00:39:04.469 --> 00:39:06.388
He was an insurance agent.

00:39:06.471 --> 00:39:08.974
FOR PERFORMANCE AND INCOME,
IT'S NOT OVER UNTIL IT'S OVER

00:39:11.101 --> 00:39:12.853
<i>Hey. It's me, Taehyeon.</i>

00:39:14.813 --> 00:39:16.148
How are you?

00:39:17.524 --> 00:39:18.901
Yeah. Well…

00:39:18.984 --> 00:39:21.653
<i>He was with a firm called Deus GA.</i>

00:39:22.946 --> 00:39:24.823
<i>Pressure on performance there was high.</i>

00:39:24.907 --> 00:39:27.409
Do you happen to have
any cancer insurance?

00:39:27.492 --> 00:39:29.244
<i>If they didn't meet the daily quota,</i>

00:39:29.786 --> 00:39:31.997
<i>the whole team wasn't allowed to go home.</i>

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:35.042
<i>And if nothing worked,</i>

00:39:35.667 --> 00:39:38.504
<i>you'd have to sign up for a policy
under your name just to go home.</i>

00:39:42.966 --> 00:39:44.510
We can finally go home now.

00:39:49.348 --> 00:39:52.226
If you can't make a sale,
you should've done this earlier.

00:39:52.309 --> 00:39:53.393
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:39:53.477 --> 00:39:54.520
Good night.

00:39:54.603 --> 00:39:55.979
- We can go home now.
- Good night.

00:39:56.647 --> 00:39:58.482
- We're finally going home.
- Good night.

00:39:58.565 --> 00:40:00.400
- I'm so tired.
- I have to take a cab now.

00:40:00.484 --> 00:40:02.277
All right, I'll see you tomorrow.

00:40:02.361 --> 00:40:03.362
- Good night!
- Good night!

00:40:03.445 --> 00:40:05.113
Let's do our best again tomorrow.

00:40:07.658 --> 00:40:10.160
Geez.

00:40:25.968 --> 00:40:27.344
Honey.

00:40:32.057 --> 00:40:33.100
Honey?

00:40:33.725 --> 00:40:35.102
- What?
- Here.

00:40:36.144 --> 00:40:37.479
You forgot your phone.

00:40:43.068 --> 00:40:45.988
<i>I could see him slowly falling apart.</i>

00:41:09.595 --> 00:41:10.929
What? He came in today?

00:41:11.013 --> 00:41:13.849
Great. I guess we're working late again.

00:41:13.932 --> 00:41:15.267
So annoying.

00:41:22.441 --> 00:41:25.527
All right.
Let's try to do well today. Okay?

00:41:26.904 --> 00:41:28.655
It looks like we're not going home again.

00:41:30.073 --> 00:41:31.384
- Again?
- He always just sits there.

00:41:31.408 --> 00:41:33.327
- What is he doing?
- It'll be overtime again.

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:35.454
Shouldn't you feel bad
for being inept?

00:41:36.038 --> 00:41:37.706
- He's making us suffer.
- He has no clue.

00:41:37.789 --> 00:41:39.625
- He's so bad.
- Incompetent and irresponsible.

00:41:39.708 --> 00:41:41.752
- Seriously.
- Unbelievable.

00:41:41.835 --> 00:41:42.878
He's hopeless.

00:41:43.962 --> 00:41:46.632
But I didn't know
he was struggling that much.

00:41:48.383 --> 00:41:49.384
I figured…

00:41:50.928 --> 00:41:53.472
Stuff like this only happened to others.

00:41:59.102 --> 00:42:01.480
Are you planning to sue the firm?

00:42:01.563 --> 00:42:03.148
I already filed the complaint.

00:42:03.232 --> 00:42:06.652
But doing it alone is overwhelming.

00:42:09.488 --> 00:42:10.489
Right.

00:42:13.659 --> 00:42:15.994
I'm sorry. Attorney Ahn,
could I have a moment?

00:42:26.588 --> 00:42:28.549
Just wrap things up.
Don't let her hire you.

00:42:29.508 --> 00:42:32.219
- Why?
- Things got a little messy.

00:42:32.928 --> 00:42:35.931
I should've told her not to come,
but the message wasn't conveyed.

00:42:36.014 --> 00:42:38.183
Just make something up and slip out.

00:42:38.267 --> 00:42:40.519
You'll have another consultation later.
You'll see then.

00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:57.119
FAMILY RELATIONS CERTIFICATE

00:43:11.842 --> 00:43:14.052
Hello, this is Attorney Kang Huiji.

00:43:15.596 --> 00:43:17.389
I'm sorry to bother you.

00:43:18.515 --> 00:43:21.435
You mentioned you visited the child once.

00:43:21.977 --> 00:43:23.729
Would you mind telling me
where he lived?

00:43:46.919 --> 00:43:50.047
We thought it'd be best to include him
in the inheritance renunciation.

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:52.216
We'll handle that ourselves.

00:43:53.008 --> 00:43:54.927
We heard
you're Jinyeong and Jina's lawyer.

00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:57.471
Then, just focus on them.
Why bother us?

00:43:58.472 --> 00:44:01.225
Jinyeong and Jina
will renounce their inheritance.

00:44:01.975 --> 00:44:05.020
That leaves Hyeonwoo as the only heir,

00:44:05.729 --> 00:44:09.107
which means all of Kim Wonho's debt
would go to him.

00:44:09.775 --> 00:44:12.736
If you agree, we'll include the child
in the renunciation.

00:44:12.819 --> 00:44:13.820
Then, what about us?

00:44:14.321 --> 00:44:16.949
If he also renounces,
it'll all fall on us.

00:44:17.032 --> 00:44:18.784
You think I wouldn't know that?

00:44:19.368 --> 00:44:21.328
It's not like you're including us too.

00:44:27.793 --> 00:44:30.462
What if I can?

00:44:33.674 --> 00:44:34.800
Well, then…

00:44:36.093 --> 00:44:37.094
Go ahead.

00:44:51.817 --> 00:44:54.236
You're from Deus GA?

00:44:54.319 --> 00:44:55.904
Yes. Hello.

00:44:56.405 --> 00:44:57.865
I'm the branch manager.

00:44:57.948 --> 00:44:59.533
And this is our president.

00:45:00.617 --> 00:45:01.702
Hello.

00:45:02.911 --> 00:45:04.162
STATEMENT OF FACTS

00:45:04.246 --> 00:45:06.832
Our company isn't that overbearing.

00:45:07.416 --> 00:45:09.918
You'll know once you look
at this statement of facts.

00:45:10.002 --> 00:45:14.339
All of our agents confirmed
we didn't operate oppressively like that.

00:45:14.423 --> 00:45:17.551
I do feel for his wife. I really do.

00:45:17.634 --> 00:45:21.388
But asking us for damages?
That's a bit much.

00:45:21.471 --> 00:45:23.640
You saw her earlier, didn't you?
Shin Jihye.

00:45:25.517 --> 00:45:27.102
- Yes.
- She keeps making a scene

00:45:27.186 --> 00:45:28.937
about taking this to court,

00:45:29.021 --> 00:45:31.481
so we have no choice
but to start preparing ourselves.

00:45:31.565 --> 00:45:34.443
Excuse me. Making a scene?

00:45:34.526 --> 00:45:37.196
Don't talk like that
about someone who's hurting.

00:45:38.405 --> 00:45:40.490
Yes, sir. I apologize.

00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:49.458
- Sir, what's going on?
- About what?

00:45:49.541 --> 00:45:51.168
How did they find out about us?

00:45:51.251 --> 00:45:52.544
Well, I don't know.

00:45:56.507 --> 00:45:58.050
You want to take their case now?

00:45:58.133 --> 00:46:01.720
They're paying a much higher fee.
What can we do? We can't take both sides.

00:46:03.222 --> 00:46:04.932
This could be a problem.

00:46:06.099 --> 00:46:08.477
Ms. Shin never officially retained us.

00:46:09.186 --> 00:46:11.313
It's not even against
Attorney-at-law Act.

00:46:11.396 --> 00:46:12.397
What's the issue?

00:46:13.565 --> 00:46:16.360
Still, she came to us first
and we were in discussion.

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:20.113
You can't reject her without any reason
just to take a bigger fee.

00:46:20.197 --> 00:46:23.325
What? You don't want it?
I'll hand it off to Attorney Bae then.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.169
No, I'll do it.

00:46:36.255 --> 00:46:39.591
When we file for Kim Jinyeong and Kim Jina
to renounce inheritance,

00:46:39.675 --> 00:46:43.595
how about including their half-sibling
and relatives too?

00:46:44.972 --> 00:46:47.432
But they're not our clients.

00:46:47.516 --> 00:46:49.059
That's true,

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:52.145
but it's just a matter
of adding their names.

00:46:52.229 --> 00:46:54.147
It won't be complicated or extra work.

00:46:54.231 --> 00:46:56.775
More work isn't really the issue.

00:46:56.859 --> 00:47:00.362
That's something
you can adjust on your own.

00:47:00.445 --> 00:47:03.365
But we're not doing this for charity.

00:47:03.448 --> 00:47:04.992
We can't just do it for free.

00:47:07.786 --> 00:47:10.539
But if only our clients
renounce the inheritance,

00:47:10.622 --> 00:47:12.916
that child ends up taking on all the debt.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.710
That can cause concern,

00:47:14.793 --> 00:47:19.047
but we can't take on every case
that weighs on our minds.

00:47:19.131 --> 00:47:20.841
Let me try convincing them again.

00:47:20.924 --> 00:47:23.385
Could we at least add the child?

00:47:30.058 --> 00:47:33.270
I really do admire this about you,

00:47:34.062 --> 00:47:36.315
but my perspective's a bit different.

00:47:37.774 --> 00:47:39.860
I get that it's heartbreaking.

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.988
But when we're working,
let's set our emotions aside.

00:47:56.877 --> 00:47:59.630
<i>It's only natural to say that,
but it was still surprising.</i>

00:48:00.464 --> 00:48:03.258
I thought she was someone
who was similar to me.

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:07.221
It was likely the right call as a boss.

00:48:07.846 --> 00:48:09.806
It's easier to justify things that way.

00:48:13.227 --> 00:48:16.355
At times like this,
just say I'm right and take my side.

00:48:16.438 --> 00:48:17.439
Wait.

00:48:18.148 --> 00:48:20.984
You said it was only natural
to say that too.

00:48:21.068 --> 00:48:23.070
I just said that to be polite.

00:48:23.153 --> 00:48:25.489
As my boyfriend,
you should do the same for me.

00:48:26.073 --> 00:48:27.115
Now, repeat after me.

00:48:28.158 --> 00:48:29.576
"Your boss was out of line."

00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:32.162
"What's so hard about helping with that?"
Go on.

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:40.128
Your boss was out of line.
What's so hard about helping with that?

00:48:40.921 --> 00:48:42.005
Good job.

00:48:46.426 --> 00:48:49.972
I know what you said wasn't wrong.
My boss has her reasons too.

00:48:52.349 --> 00:48:54.351
But he's still just a kid.

00:48:56.687 --> 00:49:00.232
If adding clients is the issue,
then I'll have to find another way.

00:49:02.693 --> 00:49:03.902
Now, it's your turn.

00:49:05.404 --> 00:49:06.405
My turn for what?

00:49:06.488 --> 00:49:08.240
Something's bothering you.
It's obvious.

00:49:12.619 --> 00:49:15.122
My boss made me turn down a client

00:49:15.205 --> 00:49:16.790
and represent the other side instead.

00:49:17.749 --> 00:49:19.918
I don't think I'll be able to
find another way.

00:49:20.002 --> 00:49:23.255
Wait, what?
Did I understand that right?

00:49:23.338 --> 00:49:25.299
A client came to you,

00:49:25.382 --> 00:49:27.634
but you turned her down
to represent the opposing side?

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:31.054
Why? Because of the retainer?

00:49:32.347 --> 00:49:33.682
Yes, pretty much.

00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:36.560
That's so messed up.

00:49:39.104 --> 00:49:40.147
It's fine.

00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:41.815
Once you get around 10 years,

00:49:42.691 --> 00:49:43.734
you have to be.

00:49:44.484 --> 00:49:45.485
And I am fine.

00:49:48.155 --> 00:49:49.740
You're not saying "nine years" anymore.

00:49:52.743 --> 00:49:54.703
Your boss was so wrong.

00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:04.421
Try this. It's delicious.

00:50:11.261 --> 00:50:14.890
<i>I'm currently employed
at the Gang-ro branch of Deus GA,</i>

00:50:14.973 --> 00:50:17.392
<i>and I worked with the late Kim Taehyeon.</i>

00:50:18.143 --> 00:50:19.645
<i>After Mr. Kim's death,</i>

00:50:19.728 --> 00:50:21.980
<i>claims of the company's pressure
on performance arose</i>

00:50:22.689 --> 00:50:24.483
<i>and there were misunderstandings about it.</i>

00:50:24.566 --> 00:50:26.860
<i>So I'd like to set the record straight.</i>

00:50:26.944 --> 00:50:31.114
<i>Our office has a family-like atmosphere
that doesn't put pressure on performance.</i>

00:50:31.615 --> 00:50:33.867
<i>On our team, we encourage
and help each other.</i>

00:50:33.951 --> 00:50:36.453
<i>There was no culture
of unreasonable meddling in</i>

00:50:36.537 --> 00:50:38.622
<i>or pressuring
our individual performances.</i>

00:50:38.705 --> 00:50:41.708
<i>The claim that agents couldn't go home
without meeting quotas</i>

00:50:41.792 --> 00:50:43.627
<i>is a delusional exaggeration.</i>

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:47.256
<i>Working hours were flexible
based on one's own task completion.</i>

00:50:47.339 --> 00:50:49.174
Geez, you're so frustrating.

00:50:49.258 --> 00:50:52.970
<i>The late Mr. Kim had always struggled
to adapt to the company's culture.</i>

00:50:53.053 --> 00:50:55.889
<i>Mr. Kim struggled</i>
<i>due to his own limitations</i>…

00:50:55.973 --> 00:50:58.559
<i>The company did not pressure
or criticize him much.</i>

00:50:58.642 --> 00:51:00.727
<i>They instead made efforts to support him.</i>

00:51:00.811 --> 00:51:03.564
<i>I hereby sign and affirm
that this statement is true.</i>

00:51:04.523 --> 00:51:05.607
<i>Kim Juhyeok.</i>

00:51:10.404 --> 00:51:11.405
Goodness!

00:51:11.905 --> 00:51:14.992
Attorney Ahn,
what brings you here so unexpectedly?

00:51:15.576 --> 00:51:16.577
Hello.

00:51:17.077 --> 00:51:19.371
Would it be possible to meet the people

00:51:19.454 --> 00:51:21.623
who signed the statement of facts
you gave earlier?

00:51:23.542 --> 00:51:24.543
Why?

00:51:25.127 --> 00:51:27.546
I'd like to get a clearer picture
of the atmosphere here.

00:51:28.672 --> 00:51:29.673
Sure.

00:51:30.174 --> 00:51:31.675
Okay, but…

00:51:32.551 --> 00:51:34.011
Most of them are busy.

00:51:34.553 --> 00:51:36.513
Maybe one or two at most are available.

00:51:37.097 --> 00:51:38.348
Yes, that's fine.

00:51:46.231 --> 00:51:47.482
It's all true.

00:51:47.566 --> 00:51:50.819
You mentioned Mr. Kim
always had trouble fitting in.

00:51:51.403 --> 00:51:52.613
In what way was that so?

00:51:52.696 --> 00:51:53.697
Well…

00:51:54.198 --> 00:51:56.408
He'd look drained
as soon as he came in for work.

00:51:56.491 --> 00:51:59.286
He barely said hi to people.

00:51:59.369 --> 00:52:02.206
Was that from the beginning
or did he change over time?

00:52:03.498 --> 00:52:04.875
I'm not sure.

00:52:04.958 --> 00:52:07.586
But he was definitely like that
toward the end.

00:52:07.669 --> 00:52:10.005
I thought maybe his depression
had come back.

00:52:10.672 --> 00:52:13.050
What? His depression came back?

00:52:13.133 --> 00:52:15.552
So he had always suffered from depression?

00:52:15.636 --> 00:52:18.639
Yes, he said he struggled with it
when he was younger.

00:52:18.722 --> 00:52:21.391
So he was already dealing
with mental health issues.

00:52:21.475 --> 00:52:22.601
How did you know that?

00:52:23.852 --> 00:52:26.188
We used to be close at first.

00:52:26.271 --> 00:52:28.982
We'd have drinks,
and he would talk about his past.

00:52:29.066 --> 00:52:31.818
He said he struggled a bit
when he was younger.

00:52:31.902 --> 00:52:35.656
So you're saying he didn't always
have trouble fitting in?

00:52:40.118 --> 00:52:41.119
Did I say that?

00:52:41.203 --> 00:52:43.622
I guess so.

00:52:43.705 --> 00:52:45.207
- Yes.
- Attorney Ahn.

00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:46.875
What does that matter now?

00:52:46.959 --> 00:52:49.503
What matters is that
we weren't the cause, right?

00:52:55.467 --> 00:52:56.468
Yes.

00:53:06.645 --> 00:53:09.356
SHIN JIHYE, DEUS GA

00:53:17.781 --> 00:53:19.700
We'll proceed with our next case.

00:53:20.576 --> 00:53:24.580
Civil case number 2025-37845.

00:53:25.122 --> 00:53:28.834
Plaintiff, Shin Jihye.
Defendant, Deus GA.

00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:46.351
Who is in attendance?

00:53:46.435 --> 00:53:50.439
This is the plaintiff, Shin Jihye.
And I'm Attorney Kim Sehyeon.

00:53:50.522 --> 00:53:51.565
For the defendant,

00:53:51.648 --> 00:53:54.610
I'm Attorney Ahn Juhyeong
with Law Group Kyungmin.

00:53:56.028 --> 00:53:57.029
Okay, have a seat.

00:54:00.657 --> 00:54:01.909
The defendant

00:54:02.409 --> 00:54:04.578
enforced oppressive practices,

00:54:04.661 --> 00:54:09.583
such as not allowing
an entire sales team to go home

00:54:10.083 --> 00:54:12.252
if an agent were unable
to meet their quota.

00:54:13.378 --> 00:54:17.007
The plaintiff's husband
developed depression due to this stress,

00:54:17.090 --> 00:54:19.051
and this ultimately led to his suicide.

00:54:19.134 --> 00:54:23.722
Therefore, the defendant is liable
to compensate the plaintiff for damages.

00:54:23.805 --> 00:54:25.224
Okay, I understand.

00:54:25.307 --> 00:54:28.018
First off, we've received
the NHIS's response

00:54:28.101 --> 00:54:30.437
to the document submission order.

00:54:30.521 --> 00:54:33.440
- Defense counsel, have you received this?
- Yes, Your Honor.

00:54:33.524 --> 00:54:35.192
Okay, please present your statement.

00:54:37.778 --> 00:54:40.948
According to the documents
submitted by the NHIS,

00:54:41.031 --> 00:54:42.741
the plaintiff's husband, the late Mr. Kim,

00:54:42.824 --> 00:54:46.286
had already been diagnosed
with depression in his twenties.

00:54:46.995 --> 00:54:48.431
To claim damages from the defendant,

00:54:48.455 --> 00:54:52.417
the plaintiff must prove a link
between the suicide and the depression

00:54:52.501 --> 00:54:56.171
and another between the depression
and the work he did at his company.

00:54:56.255 --> 00:54:58.215
However, Mr. Kim's depression

00:54:58.298 --> 00:55:01.301
appears to have existed
before he joined the company.

00:55:01.385 --> 00:55:04.888
Therefore, it has no connection
to the defendant.

00:55:04.972 --> 00:55:07.015
No! That's not true!

00:55:07.683 --> 00:55:10.060
I don't know how he was
when he was younger,

00:55:10.143 --> 00:55:13.063
but after we got married,
he never showed any signs of it.

00:55:13.146 --> 00:55:15.399
Per the statements
submitted by other agents,

00:55:15.482 --> 00:55:18.902
the defendant's company was not operated
in the manner the plaintiff claims.

00:55:20.988 --> 00:55:24.199
Since the burden of proof
lies with the plaintiff,

00:55:24.283 --> 00:55:26.285
and because she has not provided…

00:55:31.123 --> 00:55:32.457
Evidence to overcome this…

00:55:35.752 --> 00:55:37.671
We request the court
to dismiss this claim.

00:55:53.312 --> 00:55:56.732
There's one thing
I didn't get to explain last time.

00:55:59.818 --> 00:56:02.446
It's best for both of you
to renounce your inheritance.

00:56:02.529 --> 00:56:04.156
It's the simplest option.

00:56:04.239 --> 00:56:07.159
But if you both make that decision,

00:56:07.242 --> 00:56:10.370
all of your father's debts
will be given to Kim Hyeonwoo.

00:56:11.830 --> 00:56:13.832
Won't he give up his inheritance too?

00:56:14.541 --> 00:56:17.336
If he does, that debt
will pass on to your father's siblings.

00:56:17.419 --> 00:56:19.505
They're currently taking care of Hyeonwoo.

00:56:20.464 --> 00:56:22.966
That's why they won't
let him renounce it.

00:56:23.634 --> 00:56:26.386
It'll all go to the child?

00:56:30.974 --> 00:56:34.561
There's another option you can take
aside from renouncing inheritance.

00:56:34.645 --> 00:56:36.772
It's called qualified acceptance.

00:56:37.773 --> 00:56:38.774
QUALIFIED ACCEPTANCE

00:56:38.857 --> 00:56:39.942
What's that?

00:56:40.025 --> 00:56:45.155
If renunciation means
you don't inherit assets or even debts,

00:56:45.239 --> 00:56:47.241
qualified acceptance means
you only repay debts

00:56:47.324 --> 00:56:49.451
up to the value of assets
your father left behind.

00:56:49.535 --> 00:56:51.787
If the debts exceed the assets,

00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:54.289
you're not responsible
for repaying all of that.

00:56:54.373 --> 00:56:58.585
So for us,
it's basically the same as renunciation?

00:56:58.669 --> 00:57:00.754
That's right. If you go with this

00:57:00.838 --> 00:57:02.965
and even if Hyeonwoo
renounces his inheritance too,

00:57:03.048 --> 00:57:05.759
your father's debts
won't move on to his siblings.

00:57:05.843 --> 00:57:07.427
It all ends with you.

00:57:08.011 --> 00:57:11.223
That would make your relatives
willing to let Hyeonwoo renounce.

00:57:11.306 --> 00:57:12.766
Then, we can do that.

00:57:13.350 --> 00:57:16.895
Yes, but there's a catch though.

00:57:16.979 --> 00:57:19.064
Renunciation can be wrapped up
in a few days

00:57:19.147 --> 00:57:21.692
or a couple of weeks at most.

00:57:21.775 --> 00:57:25.153
But qualified acceptance takes longer
and is more complicated.

00:57:25.237 --> 00:57:27.906
You'd have to provide
a detailed accounting

00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:30.242
of every asset and debt your father left.

00:57:30.826 --> 00:57:34.204
You might even need to go through
extra steps like inheritance bankruptcy.

00:57:44.131 --> 00:57:47.176
Honestly, if it were just about you two,

00:57:47.259 --> 00:57:49.386
I'd be right to recommend a renunciation.

00:57:50.679 --> 00:57:53.056
But if you're willing to wait a little,

00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:55.726
I'll handle all of the bothersome steps.

00:57:56.226 --> 00:57:59.521
So how about considering
qualified acceptance as an option?

00:58:05.319 --> 00:58:08.572
What if Jina renounces
and only I do qualified acceptance?

00:58:09.489 --> 00:58:10.574
Yes, that's possible.

00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:15.245
We'd still get the same results
you mentioned, right?

00:58:15.787 --> 00:58:16.788
Yes.

00:58:18.999 --> 00:58:21.960
- I'll proceed with qualified acceptance.
- I'll do it too.

00:58:23.128 --> 00:58:25.964
I just thought
maybe you'd wanted to renounce.

00:58:26.548 --> 00:58:29.968
If our renouncing
means that kid takes on all the debt,

00:58:30.052 --> 00:58:31.220
I wouldn't want that.

00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:35.140
Thank you for letting us know.

00:58:35.224 --> 00:58:37.184
No, thank you.

00:58:41.396 --> 00:58:43.065
Let's move forward with this.

00:58:43.148 --> 00:58:44.566
Okay, then.

00:59:00.749 --> 00:59:02.668
QUALIFIED ACCEPTANCE

00:59:05.462 --> 00:59:08.966
So can we go ahead
and file for Hyeonwoo's renunciation?

00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:11.385
Yes, go ahead.

00:59:12.469 --> 00:59:14.054
Let us know when it's done.

00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:16.265
Yes, I will.

00:59:33.448 --> 00:59:34.449
Hello?

00:59:34.533 --> 00:59:38.203
<i>Hello, Attorney Ahn. This is Kim Juhyeok.</i>

00:59:38.871 --> 00:59:39.955
Who is this?

00:59:40.038 --> 00:59:44.251
<i>You came by our office the other day.
The insurance agency.</i>

00:59:45.043 --> 00:59:47.713
<i>I'm the one you discussed
the statement of facts with.</i>

00:59:47.796 --> 00:59:48.797
I see. Yes.

00:59:49.339 --> 00:59:51.592
<i>You wouldn't happen to need insurance,
would you?</i>

00:59:51.675 --> 00:59:53.677
<i>Cancer or accident coverage?
Pension insurance?</i>

00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:55.262
<i>We have everything.</i>

01:00:03.478 --> 01:00:04.813
You haven't clocked out yet?

01:00:06.315 --> 01:00:07.399
What?

01:00:08.609 --> 01:00:09.818
Well…

01:00:09.902 --> 01:00:11.862
No, it's not like that.

01:00:14.281 --> 01:00:15.365
Hello?

01:00:16.825 --> 01:00:17.993
<i>Hello?</i>

01:00:20.579 --> 01:00:23.707
- Okay, I'll sign up for one.
<i>- Really?</i>

01:00:25.209 --> 01:00:27.419
<i>Thank you. Yes, thank you.</i>

01:00:27.961 --> 01:00:30.339
Why didn't you do that earlier?

01:00:30.422 --> 01:00:32.090
- I'm sick of this.
- Get it right.

01:00:32.174 --> 01:00:33.967
- Go on.
- Good night.

01:00:34.051 --> 01:00:36.720
I appreciate your hard work.

01:00:36.803 --> 01:00:37.804
Hey, good work.

01:00:40.766 --> 01:00:43.477
The ruling for the Deus GA case
just came in.

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:45.562
- Should I leave it here?
- I'll take it.

01:00:46.146 --> 01:00:47.147
Okay.

01:00:47.898 --> 01:00:49.983
You won. Congratulations.

01:00:52.736 --> 01:00:53.737
I won?

01:00:55.322 --> 01:00:56.323
Yes.

01:00:57.241 --> 01:00:58.242
Thank you.

01:00:59.326 --> 01:01:00.327
Sure.

01:01:02.663 --> 01:01:05.582
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT
RULING

01:01:05.666 --> 01:01:07.876
PLAINTIFF SHIN JIHYE
DEFENDANT DEUS GA

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.002
VERDICT

01:01:09.086 --> 01:01:11.839
PLAINTIFF'S CLAIM IS DISMISSED
COSTS TO BE PAID BY PLAINTIFF

01:01:13.131 --> 01:01:14.132
Yes, come in.

01:01:26.895 --> 01:01:29.314
The ruling on Shin Jihye's case came in.

01:01:30.774 --> 01:01:31.775
Which case?

01:01:33.235 --> 01:01:34.486
The case with Deus GA.

01:01:36.572 --> 01:01:37.739
I see.

01:01:37.823 --> 01:01:40.284
Congratulations, we won the case.

01:01:40.367 --> 01:01:41.910
You came just to tell me that?

01:01:41.994 --> 01:01:45.664
- Yes, I wanted to report it to you.
- Why report this like it's a big deal?

01:01:45.747 --> 01:01:47.291
I wanted to report this one.

01:01:54.256 --> 01:01:56.842
You were never bothered
by this kind of stuff.

01:01:58.093 --> 01:01:59.511
What's different this time?

01:02:04.349 --> 01:02:06.226
It had always bothered me.

01:02:07.269 --> 01:02:09.021
I just got used to the discomfort.

01:02:11.815 --> 01:02:14.693
I thought you and I were similar,

01:02:15.903 --> 01:02:17.070
but I guess not.

01:02:18.155 --> 01:02:20.782
No, I guess not.

01:02:30.459 --> 01:02:31.460
Come in.

01:02:33.712 --> 01:02:35.672
- Ma'am.
- Yes, Attorney Kang.

01:02:38.634 --> 01:02:40.511
It's about Kim Jinyeong
and Kim Jina's case.

01:02:40.594 --> 01:02:41.595
Yes?

01:02:41.678 --> 01:02:43.764
We're proceeding
with qualified acceptance.

01:02:44.806 --> 01:02:47.184
We'll file the renunciation for the child.

01:02:47.684 --> 01:02:49.311
And we've received the retainer.

01:02:53.524 --> 01:02:54.525
Is that so?

01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:59.530
All right. If you've done all that,

01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:01.657
then what more can I ask for?

01:03:06.161 --> 01:03:07.371
Thank you, ma'am.

01:03:09.915 --> 01:03:11.124
Okay, you're free to go.

01:03:33.939 --> 01:03:35.357
Aren't you coming to dinner?

01:03:35.858 --> 01:03:36.859
I am.

01:03:37.693 --> 01:03:39.278
What happened with the case?

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:41.989
We're going with qualified acceptance.

01:03:42.072 --> 01:03:43.073
Good call.

01:03:43.574 --> 01:03:44.575
You did a good job.

01:03:44.658 --> 01:03:45.826
What about you?

01:03:48.662 --> 01:03:49.746
I won.

01:03:57.212 --> 01:03:58.422
Good job.

01:04:03.969 --> 01:04:05.012
Thanks.

01:04:19.318 --> 01:04:20.527
The seats…

01:04:29.077 --> 01:04:33.040
Five <i>tonkotsu </i>ramen
and three orders of gyoza, please.

01:04:34.041 --> 01:04:35.751
- Could you pass the soy sauce?
- Thank you.

01:04:35.834 --> 01:04:37.377
- What?
- She wants the soy sauce.

01:04:43.592 --> 01:04:45.344
- Here.
- Thanks.

01:04:45.427 --> 01:04:46.678
Why are your hands so cold?

01:04:46.762 --> 01:04:51.058
- They always get cold when I'm stressed.
- Did something happen?

01:04:51.141 --> 01:04:52.142
Nope.

01:04:53.268 --> 01:04:56.271
Other than the boss trying to hire
a replacement before anyone quits.

01:04:57.564 --> 01:04:58.857
What happened?

01:04:58.941 --> 01:05:01.652
She's probably talking about
that job posting thing.

01:05:02.236 --> 01:05:03.612
Don't pay it too much mind.

01:05:05.322 --> 01:05:07.449
- What did he say?
- Don't pay it too much mind.

01:05:07.533 --> 01:05:08.659
Don't pay it too much mind.

01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:10.661
Thanks.

01:05:10.744 --> 01:05:12.329
- She says thanks.
- She says thanks.

01:05:12.412 --> 01:05:14.331
- She says thanks.
- No need.

01:05:18.627 --> 01:05:21.964
All right. You all did a great job.

01:05:22.798 --> 01:05:23.882
Great job, everyone.

01:05:43.443 --> 01:05:50.409
Law and The City

01:06:24.943 --> 01:06:28.655
Law and The City

01:06:29.239 --> 01:06:31.575
<i>It's not like you
to take on a case like this.</i>

01:06:31.658 --> 01:06:32.743
This is it?

01:06:32.826 --> 01:06:34.328
What kind of case is this?

01:06:34.411 --> 01:06:35.851
I heard they can't pay the retainer.

01:06:36.622 --> 01:06:39.583
<i>Do you feel bad for the old man?</i>

01:06:40.626 --> 01:06:42.586
<i>I killed someone.</i>

01:06:42.669 --> 01:06:44.922
What's there to understand?

01:06:45.005 --> 01:06:46.131
It's been a long time.

01:06:47.257 --> 01:06:48.425
Please leave.

01:06:48.509 --> 01:06:49.593
<i>It was just bad luck.</i>

01:06:50.511 --> 01:06:52.596
If this keeps up, I can't work with you.

01:06:52.679 --> 01:06:53.847
<i>Why are you going this far?</i>

01:06:54.723 --> 01:06:56.391
You really don't gain anything from this?

01:06:56.475 --> 01:06:59.019
Do you only do things for your gain?

01:07:07.986 --> 01:07:09.988
