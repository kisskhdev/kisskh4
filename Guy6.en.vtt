00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:42.960
The Nice Guy

00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:45.295
THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL,
AND THE PERSONS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:46.588
SETTINGS AND EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
SERIES HAVE BEEN FICTIONALLY CREATED

00:00:46.672 --> 00:00:47.756
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:48.966
WITH THE CONSENT OF
AND IN THE PRESENCE OF GUARDIANS

00:00:56.974 --> 00:00:58.225
Park Seokcheol.

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.187
Why does it have to be you?

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:09.111
This complicates things.

00:01:24.835 --> 00:01:27.337
The Nice Guy

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:34.177
The story ends
as Sinclair reflects on himself

00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:36.263
after barely surviving war.

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:40.976
On the mirror within himself,
he finds himself similar to Demian.

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:45.022
Now, let's go back
and open the first page of this book.

00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:49.192

Doesn't the first sentence feel different?

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:51.069
Let's all read it together.

00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:53.030
Kim Changsoo!

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.114
You little...

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:56.158
What should I do?

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:57.659
Should I stick it in or not?

00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:04.166
Thank you.

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.877
Good work.

00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:11.006
- Let's eat before we leave.
- Should we?

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:13.050
- Was it all okay?
- Yes.

00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:25.479

Hi.

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:50.879
<i>Seokcheol.</i>
<i>Did you listen to the song?</i>

00:02:50.962 --> 00:02:53.465
Uh-huh. I was listening to it just now.

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:56.468
What do you call it? The melody?

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:58.053
- It's nice.
<i>- You think so?</i>

00:02:58.136 --> 00:03:01.348
What about the lyrics?
They're from someone I know.

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:03.141
The lyrics? Well...

00:03:03.225 --> 00:03:04.559
They're nice. I like them all.

00:03:04.643 --> 00:03:07.062
Be honest with me.
You don't like the lyrics?

00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:11.775
Honestly, they're a bit childish.

00:03:12.234 --> 00:03:14.403
<i>- I don't like the vibe.</i>

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:16.738
Why are you laughing?

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.616
You the one who wrote them.

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:22.411
I wrote the song,
and you wrote the lyrics.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.037
What?

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.498
I did?

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:28.750
Remember the letter you wrote to me?

00:03:28.834 --> 00:03:32.045
<i>- I just added a melody to it.</i>
- Oh.

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:41.680
I knew it.

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:45.058
No wonder it felt familiar and corny.

00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:47.936
Come on, I love it. Isn't it so cute?

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:51.148
Gosh, it's embarrassing.

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:53.442
No, it's great.

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:54.526
Where are you?

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.154
Whatever. I won't tell you.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.447
Why not?

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.740
What about you? Where are you?

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:02.159
I won't tell you either.

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:03.660
I'm almost there. Bye.

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:06.663
Miyoung.

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.294
- What?
- What?

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:24.639
I had no idea
you'd take a writing class here.

00:04:25.474 --> 00:04:26.558
The last time I came,

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:29.644
I was reminded of you when I learned
about the writing class here.

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.482
Don't tell anyone about this.

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:35.776
People find it odd
that a gangster takes such a class.

00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:39.237
How come? There's a writer from
another country who was once a gangster.

00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:40.322
He writes romance books.

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:43.158
Given the love letters you wrote,

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:45.202
you have the potential
to be a romance novelist.

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:46.578
Romance novelist...

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:49.414
If my colleagues find out,
they'll be shocked to death.

00:04:49.498 --> 00:04:52.083
So what if they find out about it?

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:54.085
You're going to resign anyway.

00:04:56.338 --> 00:04:57.380
Right?

00:04:58.715 --> 00:04:59.716
Right.

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:04.262
- Oh, I need to go in now.
- Okay.

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:06.515
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck. You can do it.

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:07.808
- I can do it.
- Right.

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:08.892
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.034
<i>So?</i>

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:28.245
Is he experienced?

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:30.080
Yes, sir.

00:05:30.956 --> 00:05:32.541
Tell him to decide quickly.

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:35.252
That punk, Kang Taehoon, is quick-witted.

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:36.753
We must catch him off-guard.

00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:38.922
I've given him some time
to think about it.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.132
- By tomorrow--
- "Time to think about it"?

00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:43.969
Hey, since when do you even care to think?

00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:45.720
Must he have time to think?

00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:47.722
What can he possibly have to think about?

00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:48.807
Still,

00:05:49.558 --> 00:05:50.851
he'll do as he's told.

00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:55.063
And about Seokcheol,

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:57.065
does he not ask you for money anymore?

00:05:57.941 --> 00:05:58.942
He does.

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:02.279
Why does he need money?
He's not one to waste money.

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:03.613
There has to be a reason.

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:06.533
I didn't bother to ask.

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:08.577
Look into it.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.955
You're in charge of our men.
You should know what's going on.

00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:27.429
THE LATE KANG SEOHYUN

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:29.264
I'm sorry.

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:33.935
I'm trying to live as you said,

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:36.146
but it's not easy.

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.279
- Who are you off to meet? A guy?
- Gosh.

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:47.073
Good for you. Bye.

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:51.244
Oh.

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:55.415
Hey, Seohyun!

00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:03.506
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.342
Will you please look here?

00:07:07.344 --> 00:07:08.720
Are you not done yet?

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:11.931
I'm almost done, Mr. Model.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.602
Will you please soften your expression?

00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:20.482
Yes.

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:21.566
Good.

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:27.238
Hey. Smile like that more often.

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:30.909
I want you to live a good life...

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.663
just like your smile now.

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:40.752
- Hey, Seohyun. Stand here.
- What?

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:42.671
Nice.

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:45.965
Gosh.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.968
One, two, three.

00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:53.807
All right. Two, two, three.

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:02.732
I'll try harder.

00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:07.112
I love you, my dear sister.

00:08:10.407 --> 00:08:12.409
VICTORY HALL

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:23.503
We're hiring a teacher
for our morning class anyway.

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:25.422
I was hesitant to ask you again.

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:29.008
- I'm sorry I didn't reach you sooner.
- No, don't mention it.

00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:32.887
But then, you were uncomfortable
having a lot of students.

00:08:32.971 --> 00:08:34.681
Are you okay with that now?

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:39.519
Of course. The more, the better.

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:45.775
Your hand shape matters the most
when playing the piano.

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:49.487
Imagine you're holding an egg-sized ball
in your hands.

00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:52.949
So that you don't drop it,
you'll use all five fingers of each hand.

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:55.702
Do what I just taught you. Ready, go.

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:03.043
Your fingers shouldn't be like this.
Round and pretty like this.

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:04.836
That's right. Good.

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:06.463
You're doing well.

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:09.174
Keep practicing, like exercising,
and you'll get better.

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:10.592
Try one more time. Slowly.

00:09:26.357 --> 00:09:28.359
BILLIARD HALL

00:09:32.447 --> 00:09:33.615
What's up?

00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:36.659
Seokcheol, Seokkyung is driving me nuts.

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:40.830
What is it this time?

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:42.749
<i>Guess what she told me yesterday.</i>

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:45.376
That she'd rather go back
than be stuck in my house

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.378
where she doesn't even
get to see Hyeonggeun.

00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:48.880
This is

00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:51.966
like a prison cell with no bars.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.551
Maybe it's worse than prison.

00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:56.054
I can't request a visitation
even if I miss Hyeonggeun.

00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:57.138
So,

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.767
I want you to send me back
to the gambling house.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.185
She finds it more comfortable there.

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:05.105
What should we do about her?

00:10:05.188 --> 00:10:07.190
<i>If we let her be, she'll run away again.</i>

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:10.276
She's staying at your place,
so try to persuade her.

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:12.570
It's easier said than done.

00:10:13.363 --> 00:10:16.116
You got her into my house.
Are you going to turn a blind eye?

00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:18.952
What's your plan?
Are you going to deal with her?

00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:21.538
Well...

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:25.416
Fine then. So what do you suggest I do?

00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:28.378
Look. I have a plan.

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:31.673
First off, we'll make her stop
thinking about running away.

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:34.717
- And how do we do that?
<i>- You know we have a weapon.</i>

00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:36.386
Someone she can't live without.

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:38.638
Who?

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:03.204
- Hyeonggeun.
- Mom.

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:04.956
Mom!

00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:11.462
Welcome back, my daughter.

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:12.547
Welcome.

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:14.090
Welcome back.

00:11:15.592 --> 00:11:16.593
Guys.

00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:18.761
Oh.

00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:27.979
Well... Father.

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:32.442
Gosh, my legs.

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:57.133
PARK SEOKHEE

00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:00.345
My gosh.

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:04.390
- What is it?
- <i>What are you up to?</i>

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:06.935
I'm doing nothing with my eyes open. What?

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:10.855
While your eyes are open,
hurry and get ready to go out.

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:13.524
Damn it, didn't you want me
to stay cooped up in this house?

00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:14.651
<i>This is an exception.</i>

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:16.694
Seokcheol will be there later.

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:19.322
<i>- What for?</i>
- He'll be there with Hyeonggeun.

00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:22.492
- Hyeonggeun?
<i>- Yes.</i>

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:24.202
I was against the idea,

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:26.621
but he wants to take you guys
to an amusement park.

00:12:28.122 --> 00:12:29.123
What?

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:32.460
Consider it a special leave
from your life in prison.

00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:35.380
<i>You have no money, right?</i>

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:40.718
You'll find a few 10,000-won bills
and a credit card in my vanity.

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:42.553
<i>Get Hyeonggeun something yummy.</i>

00:12:44.055 --> 00:12:46.224
Thanks, Seokhee.

00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:50.186
Don't get any stupid ideas.
Just have some fun with them finally.

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:51.688
Okay.

00:12:57.652 --> 00:13:00.196
Hyeonggeun.

00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:05.994
Good boy. Are you excited?

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:07.203
Goodness.

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:09.706
- Wait. Your uncle is here.
- Uncle!

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:11.624
Your uncle.

00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:13.459
Your uncle.

00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:16.170
Your uncle.

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:19.132
Uncle!

00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:21.426
Gosh, my dear Hyeonggeun.

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:23.469
I love your outfit today.

00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:25.555
It's unusual of you to take him out.

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:28.099
The weather has gotten warm,
but he's always stuck at home.

00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:30.268
Hyeonggeun, let's go somewhere fun.

00:13:30.351 --> 00:13:32.270
- Where?
- You'll find out later.

00:13:32.353 --> 00:13:33.980
Uncle, give me the Superman ride.

00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:35.940
- Superman?
- Superman!

00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:37.608
- Yes!
- Superman!

00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:39.569
Yay!

00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:41.279
Be careful.

00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:42.613
- Okay.
- Don't lose him.

00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:43.698
Get in.

00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:45.533
- Put the seat belt on.
- Okay.

00:13:45.616 --> 00:13:46.617
- The seat belt.
- Bye.

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:47.702
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.581
The seat belt. Good.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.283
Mom.

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:34.040
Mom!

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.378
Hyeonggeun.

00:14:46.844 --> 00:14:47.845
Hyeonggeun.

00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:50.556
Did you miss me or did you not?

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.849
I missed you.

00:14:53.434 --> 00:14:55.812
Thank you for missing me.

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:03.319
Gosh.

00:15:06.447 --> 00:15:09.784
So it was literally like a movie.
Is she that happy?

00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:14.831
Yes, she started tearing up
as soon as she saw him.

00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:18.626
But keep his mouth shut, okay?

00:15:18.709 --> 00:15:21.337
Don't worry, you just focus on work.

00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:23.965
- Hey, sister.
<i>- What?</i>

00:15:24.048 --> 00:15:26.175
Good job.

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:34.225
ORTHOPEDICS

00:15:34.308 --> 00:15:36.310
- Hello.
- Hello, Ms. Park.

00:15:37.061 --> 00:15:39.397
Today's Saturday.
You have a date this evening?

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.107
Where do you usually go on a date?

00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:44.193
You know it's the same as everyone else.

00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:46.654
We watch movies, or we...

00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:51.409
I'm off to the restroom.

00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:01.961
DOCTOR'S OFFICE
ORTHOPEDIST JANG KIHONG

00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:09.760
REUNION

00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:38.039
What is it?
Why are you staring at me like that?

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.374
No, it's nothing.

00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:41.834
Should I bring in a patient?

00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:43.753
Yes. It's the last one, right?

00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:45.504
Okay.

00:16:46.422 --> 00:16:47.673
Let's get it over with.

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:08.569
He's all excited.

00:17:08.653 --> 00:17:09.862
Fine.

00:17:10.947 --> 00:17:12.365
Wait until I catch you.

00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:16.577
Ms. Park.

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:18.955
Ms. Go, the herniated disk patient,
wants to see you.

00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:28.047
Did you ask for me?

00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:31.801
Yes, I did.

00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:34.971
Look. I'm in a bad mood right now.

00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:36.681
Please save it if it's something personal.

00:17:38.307 --> 00:17:40.518
I'm in a worse mood.

00:17:40.601 --> 00:17:41.727
Oh, really?

00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:43.229
How bad?

00:17:43.312 --> 00:17:44.814
Maybe a painful injection would help.

00:17:46.148 --> 00:17:47.608
Are you scaring me?

00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:49.402
Take it however you want.

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:53.906
Hey, where are you going? Hey.

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:56.826
That witch. What a vicious witch.

00:17:57.368 --> 00:17:58.369
Hey!

00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:11.716
Gosh, my back. It's killing me.

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:14.218
Why is it so hard
to do something this small?

00:18:14.969 --> 00:18:17.138
Is Hyeonggeun having fun?

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.266
You know Seokcheol will make sure he does.

00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:22.393
Who is it?

00:18:22.476 --> 00:18:23.853
Stay here. I'll go.

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:26.314
Who is it?

00:18:26.939 --> 00:18:27.940
Hello, sir.

00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:29.358
Gosh, hello.

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:30.610
- This is for you.
- Thanks.

00:18:30.693 --> 00:18:31.986
"Registered Mail."

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.162
MYOUNGSAN CITY COURT
DECISION

00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:45.291
THE CREDITOR'S REAL ESTATE WILL BE SEIZED

00:18:45.374 --> 00:18:47.251
What is it? What is it about?

00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:48.544
It's nothing.

00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:50.546
Seokcheol must've ordered something.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.256
- Ah.
- Don't bother. Let's go inside.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.841
Gosh, my back.

00:19:02.099 --> 00:19:04.310
- Hello?
- <i>Is this Ms. Kang Miyoung's phone?</i>

00:19:04.393 --> 00:19:05.394
Yes, that's me.

00:19:05.478 --> 00:19:07.480
- From <i>Little Singing Room?</i>
- That's right.

00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:09.940
<i>I'm calling from XN Entertainment.</i>

00:19:10.024 --> 00:19:11.901
<i>Do you have time for a meeting today?</i>

00:19:12.443 --> 00:19:13.527
Excuse me?

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:15.196
SAMJUN E&amp;C

00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:16.280
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

00:19:16.947 --> 00:19:20.159
Wouldn't it be nice to take this chance
to make a connection?

00:19:21.077 --> 00:19:22.536
I understand, sir.

00:19:23.704 --> 00:19:25.247
Please do this for me.

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:26.582
Sure, good-bye.

00:19:30.711 --> 00:19:31.712
So, where were we?

00:19:32.296 --> 00:19:35.091
We'll assign our men at Chungbu Station
by this week.

00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:37.968
Good. Did you arrange a meeting
with Mr. Hwang of OSEON E&amp;C?

00:19:38.052 --> 00:19:41.514
- Yes, you can talk over dinner.
- I see.

00:19:41.597 --> 00:19:44.350
- The list of this week's collected money.
- Let me see.

00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:50.606
The nightclub in Yeoljeong.
Why is it empty?

00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:54.485
Why is the box empty?

00:19:54.568 --> 00:19:55.861
Mr. Chairman.

00:19:56.404 --> 00:19:58.406
That area is
under Changsoo Gang's influence.

00:19:58.489 --> 00:20:01.283
I know.
That's why I want to collect the money.

00:20:02.368 --> 00:20:04.662
That nightclub
is practically out of business.

00:20:04.745 --> 00:20:06.122
I don't think it's necessary...

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:12.294
I apologize.

00:20:13.587 --> 00:20:15.089
You belittle that nightclub, don't you?

00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:18.968
But it was where Kim Changsoo began.

00:20:20.136 --> 00:20:22.221
What I'm after isn't that nightclub.

00:20:22.847 --> 00:20:24.390
It's his pride.

00:20:26.684 --> 00:20:29.061
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:31.605
Let's stop here.

00:20:54.336 --> 00:20:56.922
Out of the way! This is the police!

00:20:57.006 --> 00:20:58.257
Out of the way!

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.176
Here comes the warrior of justice!

00:21:00.259 --> 00:21:02.303
Hyeonggeun.

00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:03.387
Run away!

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:05.890
Run away.

00:21:10.811 --> 00:21:14.023
He's so good.
How cool.

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:16.525
- Hyeonggeun, are you sweaty?
- Yes.

00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:18.027
Did you have a lot of fun?

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.863
Hyeonggeun! Ta-da.

00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:22.072
- Thank you.
- Wow.

00:21:22.156 --> 00:21:23.365
Seokkyung.

00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:24.950
- For me?
- Yes.

00:21:25.534 --> 00:21:26.744
But I'm okay.

00:21:26.827 --> 00:21:28.204
Come on and share it with me.

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:30.122
What? Well...

00:21:30.998 --> 00:21:34.084
What on earth? Are you two close enough
to share one cotton candy?

00:21:34.877 --> 00:21:37.338
No. We're nothing like that.

00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:39.215
I won't share it with him.

00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:40.382
- Have it yourself.
- Gosh.

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:42.551
Just have it.

00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:44.970
It's better than watching
a grown-up man eat it alone.

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:47.556
I'm off now. Have fun.

00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:50.559
Good-bye, Uncle!

00:21:50.643 --> 00:21:51.894
But I don't want to.

00:21:52.436 --> 00:21:53.854
Bye, Seokcheol.

00:21:56.315 --> 00:22:00.236
Hey. I get to spend time with Seokkyung
and Hyeonggeun thanks to you.

00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:02.738
It was worth being summoned by you
on a day off.

00:22:02.822 --> 00:22:04.657
You sure are my true friend.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.076
Good. Have fun with the two of them.

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:09.411
And please make sure
to drive Hyeonggeun home.

00:22:09.495 --> 00:22:11.330
I'll even feed him well.

00:22:11.872 --> 00:22:12.873
Thank you.

00:22:12.957 --> 00:22:15.543
Your true friend is off now. Have fun.

00:22:16.377 --> 00:22:17.378
Punk.

00:22:18.504 --> 00:22:20.548
Hyeonggeun!

00:22:21.882 --> 00:22:22.967
We have a problem.

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:24.260
- What?
- We need to ride that one.

00:22:30.391 --> 00:22:33.310
- Hello, sir.
- <i>Hi, Seokcheol. Where are you?</i>

00:22:33.394 --> 00:22:37.273
- I'm at a family gathering.
<i>- A family gathering?</i>

00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:38.899
Now isn't the time for that.

00:22:38.983 --> 00:22:41.110
I need you to go
to the nightclub in Yeoljeong.

00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:42.194
What?

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:43.821
Why?

00:22:44.905 --> 00:22:46.866
Why did you come here?

00:22:46.949 --> 00:22:49.743
- Get your hands off.
- I see you've become gutsy.

00:22:49.827 --> 00:22:50.911
Hey, stop it.

00:22:51.662 --> 00:22:52.997
Wait.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.415
Okay, I get it. Move.

00:22:54.498 --> 00:22:56.667
- Hello, sir!
- Hello, sir!

00:23:06.552 --> 00:23:10.389
Have you guys decided to go
wherever your steps lead you?

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.852
Bokcheon, come closer.

00:23:16.937 --> 00:23:18.772
I won't hit you, punk. Just come closer.

00:23:23.569 --> 00:23:24.570
Hey.

00:23:24.653 --> 00:23:28.782
This nightclub is old and worn out.
It's not worth showing interest.

00:23:29.408 --> 00:23:30.409
Just leave it be.

00:23:31.076 --> 00:23:32.995
I'd love to.

00:23:33.078 --> 00:23:35.414
But my chairman thinks otherwise.
I have no choice.

00:23:38.334 --> 00:23:41.170
So, you want to start a war over this?

00:23:43.005 --> 00:23:45.883
- Tsk!
- Don't do anything silly.

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:50.346
Your boss is making my life
much more complicated already.

00:23:52.097 --> 00:23:55.976
Look.
Go and tell him exactly what I say.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.771
I get that he despises my chairman.

00:23:58.854 --> 00:24:01.565
But I don't want him
to make us hate each other.

00:24:02.858 --> 00:24:04.234
Tell him to do this for me.

00:24:10.199 --> 00:24:11.241
Yes, sir.

00:24:11.659 --> 00:24:13.494
- I'll leave for now.
- Go.

00:24:18.374 --> 00:24:20.209
Let's go, boys.

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:43.232
Tell the staff to get ready.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.278
Sir, what should we do?

00:24:48.362 --> 00:24:51.073
Taehoon Gang seems to be
picking a fight with us.

00:24:51.156 --> 00:24:52.825
Should we assign more men to Yeoljeong?

00:24:52.908 --> 00:24:54.326
Just stick to what we've done.

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:58.247
Sure, but I'll assign a few more men.
We don't know what those jerks will do.

00:24:58.747 --> 00:25:00.708
Anyway, I haven't seen Dusik around today.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:05.129
He said he'd come,
but I guess he's up to something.

00:25:05.212 --> 00:25:06.213
Like what?

00:25:07.047 --> 00:25:08.382
Well, the thing is...

00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:15.848
I heard you work
in the same field.

00:25:15.931 --> 00:25:16.932
Don't be a lowlife.

00:25:17.016 --> 00:25:19.184
Pay back what you borrowed in time.

00:25:22.229 --> 00:25:23.522
I said I'd pay you back.

00:25:23.605 --> 00:25:25.899
I'll pay you back.

00:25:28.569 --> 00:25:32.114
This just wouldn't work.
It's not working at all.

00:25:32.698 --> 00:25:34.783
Your face tells me
that you'll never pay me back.

00:25:34.867 --> 00:25:36.952
I'll take one of your organs today.
Get him.

00:25:37.036 --> 00:25:38.829
Get off me!

00:25:39.747 --> 00:25:40.831
Get off!

00:25:40.914 --> 00:25:43.083
Let go of me. I said I'd pay you back.

00:25:43.167 --> 00:25:44.209
Let go. My arm!

00:25:44.293 --> 00:25:47.004
He drinks a lot,
so his organs won't be of use.

00:25:47.087 --> 00:25:49.465
Who the hell are you?

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:52.051
Who are you?

00:25:52.718 --> 00:25:54.762
He said he'd repay you.

00:25:55.554 --> 00:25:57.765
This is why we shouldn't
lend money to gangsters.

00:25:58.348 --> 00:25:59.641
- Get him!
- Damn it.

00:26:06.523 --> 00:26:08.734
Goodness. Dusik, you bastard.

00:26:11.028 --> 00:26:12.863
Out of the way! Move!

00:26:19.912 --> 00:26:20.913
Move.

00:26:24.958 --> 00:26:26.168
Get him!

00:26:30.631 --> 00:26:31.632
WATCH YOUR HEAD

00:26:38.305 --> 00:26:40.474
We won't spare you
if you get caught.

00:26:41.642 --> 00:26:43.936
You punk!

00:26:44.019 --> 00:26:45.604
Let go of me, you bastards!

00:26:45.687 --> 00:26:46.855
Get off, you jerks!

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:54.154
Hey! Damn it.

00:26:55.906 --> 00:26:57.241
- Hurry up.
- Sir!

00:26:57.324 --> 00:26:58.325
Hurry up.

00:26:59.076 --> 00:27:01.954
Hurry up and get in. Hurry.

00:27:02.955 --> 00:27:03.956
Hey!

00:27:15.676 --> 00:27:16.885
Damn you.

00:27:18.303 --> 00:27:20.681
You're a gangster. Have you no pride?

00:27:20.764 --> 00:27:22.224
Why let loan sharks beat you up?

00:27:22.808 --> 00:27:23.809
I'm sorry, sir.

00:27:26.019 --> 00:27:28.939
You and I are both in a mess.

00:27:29.022 --> 00:27:30.023
A total mess.

00:27:32.776 --> 00:27:35.821
Get out.
Walk to the office, for self-reflection.

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:39.491
Get out now, you punk.

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.659
Hello. This is Kang Miyoung.
I'm outside the building now.

00:28:22.743 --> 00:28:24.786
Hello, Ms. Kang. You're here?

00:28:26.246 --> 00:28:27.331
Oh, I see you.

00:28:28.081 --> 00:28:30.417
- Hello.
- Please come to the second floor.

00:28:31.168 --> 00:28:32.169
Okay.

00:28:35.047 --> 00:28:37.299
<i>I watched your cover song videos</i>
<i>on social media.</i>

00:28:38.133 --> 00:28:40.510
- They were pretty nice.
- Thank you.

00:28:40.594 --> 00:28:42.554
- Do you write songs too?
- Yes.

00:28:42.638 --> 00:28:45.349
I liked the songs you wrote yourself, too.

00:28:46.516 --> 00:28:48.894
We're actually looking for
a singer-songwriter.

00:28:51.188 --> 00:28:53.899
Are you interested
in getting ready with us?

00:28:54.816 --> 00:28:56.151
Getting ready for...

00:28:56.234 --> 00:28:58.195
Getting ready to make a debut as a singer.

00:29:01.531 --> 00:29:04.493
- We'll sign an official contract too.
- A contract?

00:29:05.369 --> 00:29:06.370
Yes.

00:29:11.083 --> 00:29:12.376
What?

00:29:12.459 --> 00:29:15.671
Those damn punks. Are they that fearless?

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:17.381
You punk.

00:29:17.464 --> 00:29:21.301
If you'd accepted the Chairman's order
and killed that bastard Taehoon,

00:29:21.385 --> 00:29:23.011
this wouldn't have happened!

00:29:23.095 --> 00:29:25.764
It would've solved your money problems,
and they wouldn't have acted up.

00:29:27.224 --> 00:29:28.392
Damn you.

00:29:28.475 --> 00:29:30.602
You're bringing that up again?

00:29:31.895 --> 00:29:33.397
Gosh. Okay, whatever.

00:29:39.653 --> 00:29:40.654
Sir.

00:29:43.031 --> 00:29:46.243
The money I was promised I'd receive...
Is it still there?

00:29:46.827 --> 00:29:49.496
Hey. Dream on.

00:29:50.122 --> 00:29:52.791
Didn't you hear?
Taehoon took the third district deal.

00:29:52.874 --> 00:29:54.418
So naturally, the money is gone.

00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:58.505
You punk, goodness.

00:30:20.444 --> 00:30:23.405
Hey. Look. Take a look at this.

00:30:23.488 --> 00:30:26.158
Move it back a bit more. It's good now.

00:30:26.241 --> 00:30:27.743
What is this? It's an apartment.

00:30:27.826 --> 00:30:30.620
Gosh, it's distracting.
Why are you showing me this?

00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:33.999
I think I'll put this house up for sale.

00:30:35.042 --> 00:30:37.335
- What?
- I mean, if this house gets sold,

00:30:37.419 --> 00:30:38.837
we can pay off our debt

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.673
and use the rest
to take out a lease on someplace small--

00:30:41.757 --> 00:30:42.883
Forget it.

00:30:42.966 --> 00:30:45.177
This house is the only asset
in our entire lives.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.554
Don't make me pay rent in my later years.

00:30:47.637 --> 00:30:49.806
Then, what do you suggest we do?

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:53.351
If we do nothing,
we won't even be able to take out a lease.

00:30:56.229 --> 00:30:57.230
Goodness.

00:30:58.648 --> 00:31:00.358
It's not like

00:31:00.942 --> 00:31:02.569
I want to sell it.

00:31:02.652 --> 00:31:06.281
My father built
every part of this house himself.

00:31:06.364 --> 00:31:07.783
Forget it.

00:31:09.367 --> 00:31:10.452
Goodness.

00:31:10.535 --> 00:31:14.414
Seokkyung, Seokcheol, and Seokhee
were all born and raised here.

00:31:16.333 --> 00:31:17.334
You and this house

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:19.628
have done

00:31:20.378 --> 00:31:22.547
more than enough.

00:31:25.801 --> 00:31:27.344
NEW WORLD TOUR

00:31:33.517 --> 00:31:35.769
<i>Yes, Seokcheol.</i>

00:31:35.852 --> 00:31:38.647
<i>I feel so distressed.</i>

00:31:39.898 --> 00:31:42.400
<i>Your father</i>
<i>wants to put this house up for sale</i>

00:31:42.484 --> 00:31:44.486
<i>and take out a lease on a small house.</i>

00:31:57.082 --> 00:31:58.333
MIYOUNG

00:32:01.002 --> 00:32:02.003
Hello?

00:32:02.546 --> 00:32:03.755
I'm just

00:32:04.881 --> 00:32:06.049
working, you know.

00:32:10.178 --> 00:32:11.263
Oh, really?

00:32:13.098 --> 00:32:14.975
That's great. Congratulations.

00:32:15.934 --> 00:32:18.687
Oh, okay. I'll meet you there.

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:19.771
Okay, bye.

00:32:30.157 --> 00:32:31.575
XN Entertainment?

00:32:31.658 --> 00:32:33.076
They have a good eye.

00:32:33.577 --> 00:32:35.579
A lot of famous artists

00:32:35.662 --> 00:32:36.955
- started from that agency.
- Ah.

00:32:37.038 --> 00:32:40.458
Gosh, I had no idea
they'd offer me a chance.

00:32:40.542 --> 00:32:43.837
Come on.
All your hard work led to this day.

00:32:44.379 --> 00:32:46.756
My mom came to my mind first.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.967
I want to tell her as soon as possible.

00:32:59.436 --> 00:33:02.272
We have an emergency
with Patient Yoon Hyesook in Room 206.

00:33:02.355 --> 00:33:05.192
Ma'am!

00:33:05.275 --> 00:33:06.943
- Let go of me! Let go.
- Ma'am.

00:33:07.027 --> 00:33:08.236
- Ma'am.
- I'm going home!

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.321
Look at me.

00:33:09.404 --> 00:33:11.281
- Ma'am.
- Move, you witch!

00:33:11.364 --> 00:33:12.407
Calm down.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:14.075
Ma'am.

00:33:14.159 --> 00:33:16.203
Please calm down.

00:33:16.286 --> 00:33:18.663
Mom. Mom. What is it?

00:33:18.747 --> 00:33:21.124
- What's going on?
- She keeps insisting on going home.

00:33:21.208 --> 00:33:23.627
Mom, you promised not to do this.

00:33:24.753 --> 00:33:25.962
Come on.

00:33:26.796 --> 00:33:27.839
Miss.

00:33:28.715 --> 00:33:30.133
Miss, please help me go home.

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.136
My daughter will be hungry
when she's back from school.

00:33:33.637 --> 00:33:36.514
These witches are stopping me
from going home.

00:33:37.432 --> 00:33:38.516
Miss.

00:33:42.479 --> 00:33:43.730
Please help me go home.

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:50.111
It's all right.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.204
It must be tougher for you
than for anyone else here.

00:33:59.871 --> 00:34:02.082
You can't even remember
your daughter's face.

00:34:04.709 --> 00:34:05.794
But, Mom...

00:34:08.546 --> 00:34:11.800
when you look at me as if I'm a stranger,

00:34:13.885 --> 00:34:15.095
it breaks my heart too.

00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:18.682
When you don't remember me,

00:34:19.683 --> 00:34:21.184
I feel like I don't exist.

00:34:22.936 --> 00:34:24.062
But I do exist here.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:31.778
But do you know
what I want to do again with you the most?

00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:35.323
Making promises.

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:40.620
Promising you
not to play the piano late at night.

00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:44.082
Promising you not to skip any meals.

00:34:45.792 --> 00:34:47.627
Promising you to come home early.

00:34:49.587 --> 00:34:51.589
If I broke my promise,

00:34:52.465 --> 00:34:56.303
you'd tell me off or we'd argue.

00:34:57.012 --> 00:34:58.305
<i>When I was little,</i>

00:34:59.598 --> 00:35:04.185
she once took me somewhere far away
on a village bus.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.022
Mom, where are we going?

00:35:07.105 --> 00:35:08.523
It's a secret.

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:13.570
<i>I asked where we were going,</i>
<i>but she only laughed without telling me.</i>

00:35:17.699 --> 00:35:19.618
<i>We arrived</i>
<i>at a secondhand piano shop</i>

00:35:19.701 --> 00:35:21.995
<i>that was a bit bigger than a snack bar.</i>

00:35:22.495 --> 00:35:26.082
<i>I thought I'd pick one that made</i>
<i>the nicest, highest-pitched "do" sound.</i>

00:35:27.292 --> 00:35:32.631
<i>I kept playing "do" as I looked around</i>
<i>until the closing time.</i>

00:35:48.813 --> 00:35:52.192
<i>I promised something to my mom</i>
<i>too, but I don't remember what it was.</i>

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:58.907
<i>It was probably a small promise</i>
<i>that a daughter and mom would make.</i>

00:35:59.949 --> 00:36:02.160
Like, "I won't play the piano
late at night,"

00:36:02.243 --> 00:36:03.578
"I won't pick at food,"

00:36:03.662 --> 00:36:05.497
or "I'll behave better."

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:11.628
Those small promises

00:36:12.754 --> 00:36:13.963
mean so much to me

00:36:15.006 --> 00:36:16.424
now that I look back.

00:36:18.385 --> 00:36:19.719
I might never

00:36:20.679 --> 00:36:23.390
get to make such promises

00:36:24.391 --> 00:36:25.392
to my mom again.

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:04.431
Does it feel stiff?

00:37:07.225 --> 00:37:09.436
I thought I wouldn't get to go in.

00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:12.814
That man ends up making me a villain.

00:37:13.773 --> 00:37:16.443
All right.
Please enter and find your seats now.

00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:23.241
Inside, please.

00:37:23.324 --> 00:37:24.534
Welcome. This way, please.

00:37:28.455 --> 00:37:30.540
Ma'am, please stand in line.

00:37:31.249 --> 00:37:33.042
- Excuse me?
- Line, please.

00:37:33.585 --> 00:37:36.171
Oh, I'm not here for the concert.

00:37:36.254 --> 00:37:38.423
I just have to talk
to that man over there--

00:37:38.506 --> 00:37:41.009
Ma'am. Do you have a ticket?

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.136
Damn it.

00:37:43.219 --> 00:37:45.638
It won't take long.

00:37:46.389 --> 00:37:47.682
Goodness.

00:38:02.071 --> 00:38:05.283
- What's wrong with her?
- She wouldn't leave.

00:38:09.496 --> 00:38:10.538
Why did you laugh?

00:38:11.331 --> 00:38:13.583
You just laughed at me. Why?

00:38:16.002 --> 00:38:17.337
You're laughing again.

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:18.838
I see you laugh so easily.

00:38:18.922 --> 00:38:22.509
Hey, mister. I'm not in the mood
to ignore people who laugh at me.

00:38:22.592 --> 00:38:25.261
So let's all keep a straight face, okay?

00:38:27.347 --> 00:38:30.558
I've had enough of you, miss.

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:33.770
Come on out. Goodness.

00:38:33.853 --> 00:38:36.064
- Now, leave.
- I said I would.

00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:22.735
- I'll be going in now.
- Okay.

00:39:24.028 --> 00:39:25.029
Miyoung.

00:39:26.406 --> 00:39:28.324
Your mother will be okay.

00:39:29.868 --> 00:39:33.037
Then, you'll be able to keep
the promises you made to her.

00:39:34.497 --> 00:39:36.958
So, let's not give up.

00:39:37.792 --> 00:39:38.793
Thanks.

00:39:49.846 --> 00:39:51.097
I'll go in now.

00:39:51.681 --> 00:39:55.143
Okay. I'll come pick you up
when you're done.

00:39:55.977 --> 00:39:57.061
Okay.

00:40:32.388 --> 00:40:33.640
- Mr. Chairman.
- Hey, you.

00:40:33.723 --> 00:40:35.767
Hey.

00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:38.937
- Follow me.
- Okay. Go on.

00:40:49.656 --> 00:40:50.782
JINMI LANDSCAPING

00:41:06.214 --> 00:41:08.132
- Long time no see.
- You look great.

00:41:10.176 --> 00:41:12.345
It seems you're still a gangster.

00:41:13.721 --> 00:41:16.975
Well, things got complicated. It's a mess.

00:41:17.934 --> 00:41:18.935
Dad!

00:41:19.686 --> 00:41:22.522
Goodness, Miran!

00:41:22.605 --> 00:41:24.565
- Miran!
- Mister!

00:41:24.649 --> 00:41:25.775
Goodness.

00:41:25.858 --> 00:41:28.486
It's so nice to see you smile.

00:41:28.569 --> 00:41:29.696
Hello.

00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:32.407
- This is Miran's mom.
- Oh, I see. Hello.

00:41:34.242 --> 00:41:37.370
Thank you so much
for saving my husband's life.

00:41:37.453 --> 00:41:40.039
Don't mention it.
Anyone would've done the same.

00:41:40.123 --> 00:41:43.126
No. It wasn't something
that anyone could do.

00:41:46.379 --> 00:41:47.880
Oh, did you have lunch?

00:41:47.964 --> 00:41:50.008
If not, come join us.

00:41:50.091 --> 00:41:52.677
- Yeah, let's have lunch together.
- Sure, I'd love that.

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.929
- Let's go.
- Miran, let's go.

00:41:55.013 --> 00:41:57.181
Let's go.

00:41:57.765 --> 00:41:59.017
Thank you.

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:01.561
All right, Miran.
Here's your favorite potato <i>jeon.</i>

00:42:01.644 --> 00:42:02.645
- Eat up.
- Okay.

00:42:02.729 --> 00:42:05.231
We're quite a bunch, aren't we?

00:42:05.314 --> 00:42:06.941
All the people here

00:42:07.025 --> 00:42:10.737
are the union members who protested
at the demolition site until the end

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:13.239
and those who lost their homes.

00:42:13.322 --> 00:42:15.491
We happened to gather one after another

00:42:15.575 --> 00:42:19.370
and form some sort of community.

00:42:19.454 --> 00:42:20.538
It's pleasant to see.

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.623
- Drink some.
- I have to drive.

00:42:22.707 --> 00:42:24.333
- Let me.
- Okay, sure.

00:42:24.417 --> 00:42:26.753
Gosh. Thanks.

00:42:26.836 --> 00:42:28.004
- Ma'am.
- Thanks.

00:42:28.087 --> 00:42:29.213
No problem.

00:42:29.297 --> 00:42:32.467
- All right. Let's enjoy the food!
- I'll enjoy the food.

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:34.427
- Hey, Miran. Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:36.512
- Cheers with this mister.
- It looks so good.

00:42:38.931 --> 00:42:41.350
- So? Is it okay?
- It's to die for.

00:42:41.434 --> 00:42:43.478
- Have some steamed rice too.
- Okay.

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:53.154
If you're going to quit, do it soon.
If you hesitate, you won't be able to.

00:42:54.655 --> 00:42:55.865
I'm halfway through.

00:42:57.116 --> 00:42:59.619
I'll quit soon, for real.

00:43:00.745 --> 00:43:02.872
Even if you'll have regrets, just give up.

00:43:02.955 --> 00:43:08.044
Whether it be money or loyalty,
it only holds meaning in that field.

00:43:08.127 --> 00:43:09.879
Nothing actually matters.

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:14.133
What matters to people like us is family.

00:43:14.717 --> 00:43:17.929
They would never betray us
until the very end. Our families.

00:43:18.679 --> 00:43:21.099
They're the people we must protect.

00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:26.020
Jeez, you're such a fogey.

00:43:29.816 --> 00:43:31.692
Come to me whenever you face trouble.

00:43:31.776 --> 00:43:34.529
I won't tell you off
for joining our community halfway.

00:43:36.072 --> 00:43:37.156
Okay.

00:43:37.949 --> 00:43:39.033
Thanks for the food.

00:43:40.493 --> 00:43:41.702
Good-bye.

00:43:55.508 --> 00:43:57.218
Wasn't the concert so nice?

00:43:57.301 --> 00:43:59.137
Yes, right.

00:43:59.762 --> 00:44:02.515
The piano play was so...

00:44:03.432 --> 00:44:05.143
Do you like wine?

00:44:06.144 --> 00:44:07.145
Wine...

00:44:08.563 --> 00:44:09.814
Yes, I like it.

00:44:09.897 --> 00:44:12.859
That's right. Let's talk over some wine.

00:44:15.903 --> 00:44:16.904
Oh.

00:44:19.407 --> 00:44:20.491
I'm sorry.

00:44:21.659 --> 00:44:23.327
Excuse me?

00:44:24.537 --> 00:44:25.538
The thing is,

00:44:26.914 --> 00:44:28.332
I came here today

00:44:29.333 --> 00:44:31.669
not because I like piano music.

00:44:31.752 --> 00:44:32.879
But that doesn't mean

00:44:33.838 --> 00:44:36.716
I have good feelings for you.

00:44:38.009 --> 00:44:40.219
But it's not like
I have bad feelings either.

00:44:40.303 --> 00:44:41.429
What I'm trying to say is...

00:44:43.222 --> 00:44:44.223
The truth is,

00:44:45.391 --> 00:44:47.894
I have a girlfriend,
and we've promised to get married.

00:44:49.395 --> 00:44:50.396
I see.

00:44:50.479 --> 00:44:53.357
I'm sorry.
I should've let you know sooner.

00:44:54.025 --> 00:44:55.067
It's fine.

00:44:55.735 --> 00:44:57.820
I came because my mom forced me to.

00:44:58.571 --> 00:45:00.990
Oh, really? That's great.

00:45:01.782 --> 00:45:03.701
Is it?

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:06.329
I guess we can say that.

00:45:07.246 --> 00:45:09.081
Go meet your girlfriend.

00:45:09.165 --> 00:45:10.583
Gosh, I'm sorry.

00:45:10.666 --> 00:45:11.918
I'll be going then.

00:45:12.001 --> 00:45:13.336
Well...

00:45:13.419 --> 00:45:14.837
Could you perhaps keep

00:45:15.713 --> 00:45:19.800
what happened today
a secret between the two of us?

00:45:22.929 --> 00:45:24.222
Thank you.

00:45:24.305 --> 00:45:25.473
Well then...

00:45:26.057 --> 00:45:27.141
Good-bye.

00:45:46.452 --> 00:45:48.120
DOCTOR JANG KIHONG

00:46:09.183 --> 00:46:10.601
Excuse me.

00:46:12.228 --> 00:46:14.021
It's really you, the nurse.

00:46:14.105 --> 00:46:15.398
Goodness.

00:46:16.274 --> 00:46:18.150
- Wait.
- Do you remember me?

00:46:18.234 --> 00:46:20.319
I'm the jujitsu player from your hospital.

00:46:20.903 --> 00:46:22.029
What are you doing here?

00:46:22.113 --> 00:46:23.739
Are you here to drink too?

00:46:24.282 --> 00:46:26.325
No, I train at a gym nearby.

00:46:27.201 --> 00:46:29.495
I saw you come in and followed you.

00:46:36.585 --> 00:46:39.171
So, you sat here

00:46:40.089 --> 00:46:41.257
to have a drink?

00:46:42.008 --> 00:46:43.175
Can I drink with you?

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:45.261
Okay.

00:46:45.761 --> 00:46:46.762
Excuse me.

00:46:47.263 --> 00:46:50.474
<i>The person</i>
<i>you have reached is unavailable.</i>

00:46:51.517 --> 00:46:53.394
Sir, could you drive faster?

00:46:53.894 --> 00:46:54.979
Sure.

00:47:09.285 --> 00:47:11.829
What on earth? Finish it.

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:15.166
Well, I have low alcohol tolerance.

00:47:15.249 --> 00:47:17.043
Drink, and it'll get higher.

00:47:17.126 --> 00:47:18.210
Why not use honorifics?

00:47:18.294 --> 00:47:20.254
I'm older. Want me to use honorifics?

00:47:20.338 --> 00:47:21.505
Drink.

00:47:26.677 --> 00:47:28.429
But your phone keeps buzzing.

00:47:32.016 --> 00:47:34.602
Dr. Jang Kihong keeps calling you.

00:47:37.146 --> 00:47:39.398
- Is he your boyfriend?
- It's none of your business.

00:47:43.694 --> 00:47:45.988
Hello, I'm Ms. Park Seokhee's boyfriend.

00:47:46.072 --> 00:47:47.323
Stop calling her.

00:47:50.368 --> 00:47:51.369
Hello...

00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:58.918
I'm sorry!

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:08.928
Good job.

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.430
- What?
- I said, good job.

00:48:13.391 --> 00:48:16.519
Does this mean you'll go out with me?

00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:19.397
Wake up.

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:21.816
You're not my type, okay?

00:48:23.692 --> 00:48:25.069
Why do you use honorifics now?

00:48:26.529 --> 00:48:28.072
Because I want to. Got a problem?

00:48:28.781 --> 00:48:30.241
Hold on.

00:48:30.324 --> 00:48:32.493
- Wait. Where are you going?
- I'm going home.

00:48:33.244 --> 00:48:35.371
The bill's on me,
so stay and drink, kiddo.

00:48:35.454 --> 00:48:36.580
- Oh...
- Bye.

00:48:40.709 --> 00:48:41.710
Bye.

00:48:43.295 --> 00:48:45.214
Hyeonggeun. Meat airplane!

00:48:45.297 --> 00:48:46.632
It's mine.

00:48:46.715 --> 00:48:49.051
Come on!

00:48:49.135 --> 00:48:50.594
Goodness.

00:48:51.137 --> 00:48:52.138
Eat slowly.

00:48:53.055 --> 00:48:56.267
Mom, I got a perfect score
on my test at school.

00:48:56.350 --> 00:48:57.643
My gosh.

00:48:57.726 --> 00:48:59.979
You must be a smart student.

00:49:00.062 --> 00:49:01.814
I'm so proud of you, sweetheart.

00:49:01.897 --> 00:49:03.858
- He takes after me.
- Does he?

00:49:03.941 --> 00:49:05.317
Mom.

00:49:05.401 --> 00:49:07.820
- Yes?
- Are we going home together?

00:49:08.487 --> 00:49:09.488
Today?

00:49:09.572 --> 00:49:11.824
What kind of gift do you want
from your grandparents?

00:49:11.907 --> 00:49:15.578
I can't go with you today.

00:49:16.287 --> 00:49:19.832
What? I thought we would.

00:49:19.915 --> 00:49:22.376
Uh, Hyeonggeun.

00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:26.338
Your mom can't go home with you today.

00:49:27.173 --> 00:49:29.467
But she will come home soon.

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:30.759
- Really?
- Yes.

00:49:30.843 --> 00:49:31.927
Tomorrow?

00:49:32.845 --> 00:49:35.181
Or on the open class day?

00:49:35.264 --> 00:49:36.557
Will you come then?

00:49:39.685 --> 00:49:41.479
Yes.

00:49:41.562 --> 00:49:43.856
Of course. I'll come for sure.

00:49:43.939 --> 00:49:47.359
I'll come and watch you study there.

00:49:54.325 --> 00:49:55.576
Eat up.

00:49:57.411 --> 00:49:58.913
- Is it good?
- Yes.

00:50:53.926 --> 00:50:56.387
Seokkyung, go home with him.

00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:06.814
Hyeonggeun will be sad
if he wakes up and finds you gone.

00:51:07.773 --> 00:51:10.526
How can I possibly go home
as if nothing happened?

00:51:13.362 --> 00:51:15.197
I can't do that.

00:51:15.281 --> 00:51:17.491
You should, at least for him.

00:51:19.743 --> 00:51:21.203
Your parents will understand.

00:51:24.164 --> 00:51:25.249
Byeongsoo.

00:51:26.292 --> 00:51:27.376
Thanks for today.

00:51:32.381 --> 00:51:33.465
Take him home safely,

00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:35.551
please.

00:52:19.803 --> 00:52:21.972
<i>If you're going to quit,</i>
<i>do it soon.</i>

00:52:22.056 --> 00:52:24.058
<i>If you hesitate, you won't be able to.</i>

00:52:25.476 --> 00:52:26.727
I'm halfway through.

00:52:27.936 --> 00:52:30.439
I'll quit soon, for real.

00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:33.734
Even if you'll have regrets, just give up.

00:52:33.817 --> 00:52:38.906
Whether it be money or loyalty,
it only holds meaning in that field.

00:52:38.989 --> 00:52:40.741
Nothing actually matters.

00:52:41.533 --> 00:52:45.037
What matters to people like us is family.

00:52:45.537 --> 00:52:48.874
They would never betray us
until the very end. Our families.

00:52:49.541 --> 00:52:51.752
<i>They're the people we must protect.</i>

00:53:08.352 --> 00:53:10.813
<i>Every life holds its own meaning.</i>

00:53:12.731 --> 00:53:17.194
<i>The truth is, one's life is made up</i>
<i>of its own beauty and solidity,</i>

00:53:17.778 --> 00:53:19.530
<i>which I don't know.</i>

00:53:33.627 --> 00:53:38.132
<i>Nevertheless,</i>
<i>one's life rends my heart at times.</i>

00:53:47.808 --> 00:53:51.437
<i>Each life is a path that leads to oneself.</i>

00:54:07.411 --> 00:54:10.247
<i>I'm worried.</i>
<i>I waited by your house. I'm leaving now.</i>

00:54:45.782 --> 00:54:51.079
<i>No one has ever become</i>
<i>their complete self before.</i>

00:54:52.039 --> 00:54:53.165
- Hello, ma'am.
- Goodness.

00:54:53.248 --> 00:54:54.625
My pumpkin.

00:54:54.708 --> 00:54:56.376
- Lay him down there.
- He's asleep.

00:54:56.460 --> 00:55:00.380
- Byeongsoo, why are you alone?
- Well, Seokcheol had something to do.

00:55:00.464 --> 00:55:03.759
Gosh, Hyeonggeun. You're awake.

00:55:03.842 --> 00:55:06.261
Did you have fun today?

00:55:08.388 --> 00:55:11.225
What's wrong with him?

00:55:11.308 --> 00:55:13.435
I guess he had a nightmare on the way.

00:55:13.519 --> 00:55:14.853
Right, Hyeonggeun?

00:55:15.562 --> 00:55:16.980
- Poor thing.
- There, there.

00:55:17.064 --> 00:55:18.815
- <i>Every human...</i>
- It's all right.

00:55:18.899 --> 00:55:20.275
<i>...can be more than just themselves.</i>

00:55:21.527 --> 00:55:23.278
<i>Each of us is unique and special.</i>

00:55:24.738 --> 00:55:28.784
<i>They're a wondrous point</i>
<i>where the world's phenomena intersect...</i>

00:55:28.867 --> 00:55:30.994
<i>- ...only once within time.</i>

00:55:44.174 --> 00:55:46.343
<i>There's something that surges within me.</i>

00:55:47.302 --> 00:55:49.054
<i>I'm living that very thing.</i>

00:55:51.265 --> 00:55:53.016
<i>I wonder what made it so difficult.</i>

00:56:07.197 --> 00:56:10.242
CEO KANG TAEHOON

00:56:34.850 --> 00:56:36.518
- Are you leaving, sir?
- Yes.

00:56:36.602 --> 00:56:37.853
I'll have the car ready.

00:56:38.854 --> 00:56:41.690
No. Give me the keys. I'll go alone.

00:56:43.275 --> 00:56:44.568
Leave work early today.

00:56:49.156 --> 00:56:51.158
Your regular caffè latte is ready.

00:56:51.241 --> 00:56:53.452
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

00:56:53.535 --> 00:56:55.621
Sorry. I'll do that.
You can take the orders.

00:56:55.704 --> 00:56:58.165
Three lattes,
and one Americano with less water.

00:56:58.248 --> 00:56:59.583
What's your signature?

00:57:03.253 --> 00:57:04.880
Coffee shops usually have one.

00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:06.923
A special drink or something.

00:57:12.054 --> 00:57:13.680
- Americano.
- Ame...

00:57:17.017 --> 00:57:18.018
Fine.

00:57:18.852 --> 00:57:21.563
Then, I'll have a cup of special Americano
made by you.

00:57:21.647 --> 00:57:24.399
That'll be 4,500 won.
I've taken your credit card.

00:57:24.483 --> 00:57:26.985
- Do you have a stamp card?
- Forget that, just charge the card.

00:57:30.572 --> 00:57:31.573
Miyoung.

00:57:34.618 --> 00:57:36.453
Let's talk for a moment.

00:57:53.804 --> 00:57:55.222
Have you made up your mind?

00:57:56.932 --> 00:57:58.558
Yes, I'll finish him once and for all.

00:58:03.188 --> 00:58:05.023
Once you're done with the job,

00:58:05.107 --> 00:58:08.568
keep a low profile for about a month,
and turn yourself in.

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:12.280
And don't worry, okay?

00:58:14.491 --> 00:58:15.492
Yes, sir.

00:58:26.211 --> 00:58:30.257
Anyway, don't you want to know
who you're supposed to finish?

00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:34.261
Who is it?

00:58:37.013 --> 00:58:38.014
Kang Taehoon.

00:58:51.653 --> 00:58:52.654
Why do you

00:58:54.364 --> 00:58:56.783
ask for trouble in life?

00:58:57.534 --> 00:58:59.369
You can choose an easy life.

00:58:59.870 --> 00:59:02.372
You can't survive only on hope.

00:59:02.456 --> 00:59:03.790
Sometimes, money...

00:59:04.374 --> 00:59:06.209
Yes, if possible,

00:59:06.835 --> 00:59:09.880
you can achieve dreams
and solve problems with money.

00:59:09.963 --> 00:59:11.214
That's how it works.

00:59:12.883 --> 00:59:14.050
I can help you.

00:59:16.344 --> 00:59:17.471
Well, just have

00:59:18.305 --> 00:59:21.141
a cup of special Americano with me
from time to time like this.

00:59:21.683 --> 00:59:23.435
I doubt it's a hard thing to do.

00:59:25.937 --> 00:59:26.938
Look.

00:59:28.690 --> 00:59:31.151
I don't want to buy my dream
with someone else's money.

00:59:31.234 --> 00:59:33.236
I don't want to hear such a thing again.

00:59:34.654 --> 00:59:36.865
And don't ever visit me like this again.

00:59:44.998 --> 00:59:46.124
This is hard.

00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:57.886
I hear you're dating Seokcheol.

01:00:09.147 --> 01:00:10.148
I know him well.

01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:12.859
I know what he's like.

01:00:20.325 --> 01:00:23.078
When he suffers, he endures it to the end.

01:00:24.037 --> 01:00:25.914
But he can't watch others suffer.

01:00:26.414 --> 01:00:29.543
He tends to be very enthusiastic
about other people's business.

01:00:30.919 --> 01:00:31.920
Miyoung.

01:00:34.548 --> 01:00:37.384
If you keep this up,
I may take it out on him.

01:00:41.805 --> 01:00:43.223
- Welcome.
- Hello.

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:45.058
Well...

01:01:26.808 --> 01:01:28.184
The Nice Guy

01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:31.021
<i>Did something happen? What's wrong?</i>

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:34.357
<i>What you told me before.</i>

01:01:34.441 --> 01:01:35.984
<i>Do you still mean it?</i>

01:01:36.651 --> 01:01:38.278
<i>You said if someone harassed me,</i>

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:40.655
<i>you'd do the same.</i>

01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:42.073
Damn it!

01:01:43.658 --> 01:01:44.868
<i>Always.</i>

01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:48.330
<i>It means you may</i>
<i>catch up with Seokcheol's life.</i>

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:50.832
<i>Think wisely about what's right.</i>

01:01:50.916 --> 01:01:52.334
<i>This is Kang Miyoung.</i>

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:55.003
<i>I told you</i>
<i>I had a reunion yesterday.</i>

01:01:55.086 --> 01:01:58.465
I expected
you'd never lie to me, at least.

01:01:58.548 --> 01:01:59.925
Let's break up.

01:02:01.009 --> 01:02:02.427
<i>Miyoung, wait.</i>

01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:05.805
Wait. Can't you stop pushing me away?
I also have a heart that breaks.

01:02:05.889 --> 01:02:07.098
Let go of her.
