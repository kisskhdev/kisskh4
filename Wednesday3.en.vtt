00:10.427 --> 00:12.429
[eccentric, baroque music playing]

00:19.060 --> 00:21.896
[Morticia] Stassa's waiting list
is six months long.

00:21.980 --> 00:25.316
How did you get her up to Jericho
on a moment's notice?

00:25.400 --> 00:28.236
She has a sore spot
for disembodied appendages.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.822
And I tripled her usual fee.

00:31.531 --> 00:34.909
[Morticia] I'm so mortified
we forgot Thing's birthday.

00:34.993 --> 00:36.536
It's unforgivable.

00:36.619 --> 00:40.498
I've been so preoccupied with the children
and chairing the fundraising gala--

00:40.582 --> 00:42.208
No, no, no, no, no…

00:42.292 --> 00:44.085
Fret not, cara bella.

00:44.711 --> 00:47.047
Another hour under Stassa's deft touch,

00:47.964 --> 00:49.591
Thing will be a new hand.

00:51.176 --> 00:53.595
Tell me, how goes the fundraising?

00:54.763 --> 00:56.014
Agonizing.

00:58.308 --> 00:59.309
[sighs]

00:59.392 --> 01:00.435
Last night,

01:01.144 --> 01:04.064
I had the sudden urge to call Mama,

01:04.147 --> 01:05.857
and ask her to be

01:06.357 --> 01:08.026
guest of honor at the gala.

01:08.109 --> 01:09.319
[gasps]

01:09.402 --> 01:11.029
How very distressing.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.491
She is Nevermore's wealthiest alumni.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.994
Doubtless that's why
Principal Dort recruited me.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.788
Of course not, darling.

01:19.871 --> 01:22.791
[indignant huff]
I will never understand why my…

01:24.125 --> 01:26.294
[through gritted teeth] …dearest Mama

01:26.377 --> 01:29.672
has to make
every interaction so torturous.

01:29.756 --> 01:33.760
Fortunately, I have
a very high threshold for pain.

01:34.427 --> 01:37.222
Which I find intoxicating.

01:38.515 --> 01:39.766
[Gomez smooching]

01:42.936 --> 01:47.273
Perhaps I can help you
take your mind off your…

01:47.357 --> 01:48.358
mother.

01:51.986 --> 01:53.947
[sensuous tango music playing]

02:34.737 --> 02:35.572
[faint thud echoes]

02:35.655 --> 02:36.948
[music intensifies, halts]

02:37.031 --> 02:41.911
Darling, I'm going to slip into something
a little bit more uncomfortable.

02:43.538 --> 02:47.041
Make sure it has
a lot of spikes and buckles.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.003
[anticipatory exhale]

02:56.050 --> 02:58.428
I underestimated your bat-like hearing.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.722
And my maternal intuition.

03:02.432 --> 03:05.852
Did you honestly think
I would hide Goody's book in there?

03:05.935 --> 03:08.479
You used to hide
our Dia de los Muertos presents in here.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.815
Because I wanted you to find those.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.903
Do you remember my favorite bedtime story?

03:14.986 --> 03:16.112
Mm-hmm.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.990
The Salem Witch Trial transcripts.

03:19.073 --> 03:22.368
Nothing put you to sleep faster
than the rantings of the condemned.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.787
They were allowed
to make their case to the magistrate.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.582
Allow me the same courtesy?

03:30.877 --> 03:32.462
In my most recent vision,

03:33.213 --> 03:35.673
I learned that I am responsible
for Enid's death.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.259
What did you see?

03:38.343 --> 03:40.053
A headstone with Enid's name.

03:40.136 --> 03:42.639
It was in the middle of
a graveyard filled with crows.

03:42.722 --> 03:45.099
They were being led by a one-eyed crow.

03:46.684 --> 03:48.811
Then Enid appeared
and claimed it was my fault.

03:50.563 --> 03:53.524
Galpin was murdered
by that same one-eyed crow.

03:53.608 --> 03:56.361
And his former partner
was also killed by these birds.

03:57.487 --> 04:00.156
These aren't random attacks.
Someone is behind it all.

04:00.698 --> 04:01.699
An Avian?

04:04.244 --> 04:07.163
I need to find the killer
before they get to Enid.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.751
I am not appealing to you as my mother,

04:12.377 --> 04:13.795
but as a fellow psychic.

04:14.295 --> 04:18.341
As a fellow psychic,
you understand your visions are unreliable

04:18.424 --> 04:20.510
and open to many interpretations.

04:20.593 --> 04:21.636
Not mine.

04:22.804 --> 04:26.683
I had mastered my ability.
It showed me exactly what I needed to see.

04:26.766 --> 04:27.767
Hmm.

04:28.643 --> 04:30.937
Like that serial killer, hmm?

04:31.896 --> 04:33.022
In Kansas City.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.315
[chilling music plays]

-[music halts]
-Every artist needs their own signature.

04:39.445 --> 04:42.407
You've made a very compelling argument…

04:44.033 --> 04:45.785
to never give you back that book.

04:47.036 --> 04:49.414
You haven't mastered anything.

04:49.497 --> 04:51.791
But the only answers I have
are in that book.

04:51.874 --> 04:53.001
They're not answers.

04:53.084 --> 04:54.877
They're shortcuts

04:54.961 --> 04:58.798
that will lead you down
a treacherous path filled with pain.

04:58.881 --> 05:01.217
Your treacherous path
is my walk in the park.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.510
[scoffs]

05:02.593 --> 05:04.304
You sound just like Ophelia.

05:05.013 --> 05:07.890
She was impatient and strong-willed,

05:07.974 --> 05:11.185
and allowed her ability
to drive her to madness.

05:11.269 --> 05:12.937
I'm not your sister.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.564
No, you're my daughter.

05:15.356 --> 05:17.275
And I won't fail you

05:17.358 --> 05:19.485
the way that my mother failed Ophelia.

05:20.778 --> 05:22.196
This isn't over.

05:27.618 --> 05:29.912
[Gomez chortling]

05:29.996 --> 05:31.164
[inhales deeply] Tish?

05:33.166 --> 05:34.834
I'm sorry, mon cheri.

05:35.501 --> 05:38.963
The romantic mood
has unexpectedly escaped me.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.048
[gasps]

05:42.133 --> 05:43.301
Maybe later.

05:44.385 --> 05:45.511
[giggles]

05:45.595 --> 05:47.597
[jauntily macabre music playing]

05:59.859 --> 06:02.320
Until I can thwart my mother
and get Goody's book back,

06:03.237 --> 06:05.907
I might have to solve
this case the old-fashioned way.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.702
Galpin may have
finally left a useful clue.

06:11.579 --> 06:14.499
Yet even in death,
he refuses to cooperate.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.043
[Enid] Ugh! I'm doomed.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.170
I have nothing to wear.

06:20.129 --> 06:22.590
And where's the top
to my zebra-striped bikini?

06:22.673 --> 06:23.716
Hiding in shame.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.344
Are you gonna stare
at that disgusting eyeball,

06:26.427 --> 06:27.720
or help out your friend?

06:27.804 --> 06:29.639
[Wednesday]
It's an overnight camping trip.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.432
How many outfits could you need?

06:31.516 --> 06:32.600
There's the bus fit,

06:32.683 --> 06:35.603
and then the opening campfire,
then the late-night swim,

06:35.686 --> 06:38.106
then the morning hike,
and the final jamboree.

06:38.189 --> 06:40.483
Not to mention
breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.693
If you came, it would be
the perfect opportunity

06:42.777 --> 06:44.445
to get to know the Wolf Pack better.

06:44.529 --> 06:47.949
As Voltaire once said, "The happiest
of lives is a busy solitude."

06:48.032 --> 06:49.742
You can't avoid people forever.

06:50.701 --> 06:52.995
Ironic, considering
you've been avoiding Ajax.

06:53.079 --> 06:56.457
He keeps dropping gifts at the door
like some desperate raccoon.

06:56.541 --> 06:59.710
Ugh! I just didn't expect my relationship
with Bruno to heat up so quickly.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.380
We literally skipped
right past the talking phase.

07:02.463 --> 07:05.341
[sighs] Oh, I don't know
how to break things off with Ajax.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.301
A quick blow to the head should suffice.

07:08.219 --> 07:11.013
I don't want to hurt his feelings.
It's not his fault we grew apart.

07:13.182 --> 07:15.143
Didn't Divina borrow your swimsuit top?

07:15.768 --> 07:17.687
Oh my God. Maybe she did. Thank you.

07:18.563 --> 07:19.564
[door opens]

07:21.607 --> 07:23.651
I don't know
if Divina borrowed her bikini top.

07:23.734 --> 07:26.446
I needed the decibel level
to go down so I could think.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.576
That premonition stays between us.

07:32.326 --> 07:35.246
She's gone full Sylvia Plath
over a bikini top.

07:35.329 --> 07:38.082
Who knows how she'd react
if she knew I had a vision of her death?

07:38.166 --> 07:41.002
Enid's dying? Can I sing at the funeral?

07:41.502 --> 07:43.045
"Somewhere Over the Rainbow."

07:43.129 --> 07:45.548
Feels very Enid.
I already know the lyrics.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.633
How long have you been here?

07:48.551 --> 07:50.845
Since… this.

07:50.928 --> 07:52.430
Make it disappear again.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.307
Enid's not going to die,

07:54.390 --> 07:56.100
because I'm going to find
the murderer first.

07:57.393 --> 07:58.311
Breathe a word--

07:58.394 --> 08:01.481
And you'll find
some fiendishly exotic way to kill me.

08:01.564 --> 08:02.482
I know.

08:04.525 --> 08:06.277
So what's our next move?

08:06.360 --> 08:07.945
There is no next move.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.281
I already have a right hand.

08:10.364 --> 08:11.491
I don't need another.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.826
Go find somebody else to stalk.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.661
The more you push me away,

08:16.162 --> 08:18.122
the more I'll want to please you.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.292
Classic emotional manipulation technique.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.089
I'm late for a funeral.

08:27.798 --> 08:30.384
If you're here when I get back,
I'll be early for another.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.765
[bees buzzing]

08:38.726 --> 08:42.188
So, Slurp just came back on his own?

08:42.271 --> 08:44.649
Yep. He was in here
when I came in this morning.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.235
He looks different.

08:47.318 --> 08:48.903
I… I think he's healing.

08:48.986 --> 08:51.489
-[Slurp burps]
-Check out the inside of his skull.

08:53.991 --> 08:57.286
[Pugsley] I think he's even starting
to regrow a brain in there.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.496
[Eugene] Incredible.

08:59.080 --> 09:03.751
It's like he's regenerating
in hyper speed.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.546
[Pugsley] I'm telling you,
it's the mystery meat.

09:06.629 --> 09:09.090
The more he eats, the more alive he gets.

09:09.882 --> 09:12.176
What are we going to do
if he runs away again?

09:12.927 --> 09:13.928
He won't.

09:14.637 --> 09:18.057
He may be brainless, but he knows
he's got a sweet set-up here.

09:18.140 --> 09:20.268
Who else is going to take care of him?

09:20.851 --> 09:23.437
[Eugene] Whoa! Check out this larva!

09:26.023 --> 09:29.443
New England corpse moth.
Super rare. Only ever found--

09:29.527 --> 09:30.570
In corpses?

09:33.364 --> 09:35.700
-[retches]
-What's the matter, boy?

09:36.284 --> 09:38.286
[grunts, yowls]

09:38.369 --> 09:41.414
Did you hear that? He said his first word.

09:41.497 --> 09:43.916
Br…

09:44.000 --> 09:45.459
That's right, I am your bruh!

09:45.543 --> 09:46.460
[Eugene] He's a zombie.

09:46.544 --> 09:50.047
He's not trying to call you his bruh.
He's trying to say "brains."

09:51.549 --> 09:53.593
Don't use the Z word.

09:54.385 --> 09:55.428
He's sensitive.

09:56.095 --> 09:57.430
How do you not know this?

09:57.513 --> 09:59.223
We're supposed to be his friends!

10:00.308 --> 10:02.768
No biting! No biting! Bad Slurp!

10:02.852 --> 10:04.854
This is way too dangerous.
We need to tell someone.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.188
No!

10:06.272 --> 10:08.899
They'll take him away,
or worse, put him down.

10:08.983 --> 10:12.361
He's already dead. We can't leave him
here alone while we're off camping.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.863
Don't worry about that.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.157
I already got that covered.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.878
[officiant] May the road rise to meet you.

10:28.961 --> 10:31.213
May the wind be at your back.

10:31.297 --> 10:36.510
May the sunshine warm your face,
and may the rains fall upon your fields.

10:37.428 --> 10:41.015
May God hold you always. Amen.

10:42.350 --> 10:43.392
Two mourners.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.021
That's two more than Galpin ever deserved.

10:47.104 --> 10:49.148
[Santiago] The department
had to send an official.

10:49.231 --> 10:50.900
He was a former sheriff.

10:51.692 --> 10:53.444
I lost the coin toss with Ryken.

10:54.403 --> 10:56.614
And I'm here representing Tyler.

10:56.697 --> 11:00.743
He rather grimly asked me
to make sure his father was really dead.

11:00.826 --> 11:01.786
What's your excuse?

11:01.869 --> 11:04.121
I'm mixing business with pleasure.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.706
Funerals are a hobby.

11:06.457 --> 11:09.585
And killers have a habit of showing up
to their victims' interments.

11:09.669 --> 11:13.381
Dr. Fairburn tells me
you visited Tyler at Willow Hill.

11:14.590 --> 11:16.550
He won't give you clues.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.803
He'll send you down rabbit holes.

11:18.886 --> 11:21.138
It doesn't take
years of police work to see that.

11:21.222 --> 11:25.142
It wasn't years of police work
that exposed Tyler as a Hyde. It was me.

11:25.726 --> 11:27.186
Then I shouldn't have to warn you

11:27.269 --> 11:30.523
to stay out of the crosshairs
of another unhinged Outcast.

11:31.232 --> 11:34.360
Whoever killed Galpin
and Bradbury means business.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.904
Don't tempt fate, Ms. Addams.

11:39.031 --> 11:40.658
Did Galpin ever visit Tyler?

11:42.326 --> 11:44.537
You don't really expect me
to tell you that.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.083
Once.

11:50.167 --> 11:54.338
Within seconds, Tyler transformed.
Almost ripped through those titanium bars.

11:55.047 --> 11:58.968
It took five minutes with a shock collar
before he returned to his human form.

11:59.051 --> 12:00.469
Never seen anything like it.

12:01.178 --> 12:03.931
Pure, undiluted rage.

12:05.599 --> 12:08.436
This killer, I think they're an Avian.

12:10.187 --> 12:12.356
The ability to control birds.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.401
Intriguing theory.

12:16.861 --> 12:20.072
Rest assured, we have
no Avian patients at Willow Hill.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.409
I appreciate your candor.

12:24.535 --> 12:29.331
Like you said, the only reason that Tyler
is safely locked away is because of you.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.294
I think that's worth a little
off-the-record quid pro quo.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.631
That's more than Galpin ever gave me.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.428
[mysterious, unsettling music playing]

into defenders and attackers.

the other side's zephyr hostage.

the zephyr by any means necessary.

has reclaimed their zephyr,

on the tripod at the top wins.

to select your teammates.
