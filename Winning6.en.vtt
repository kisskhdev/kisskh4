Coach Ju.

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:05.315
What are you doing here?

What are you doing here, Heung-nam?

00:01:43.144 --> 00:01:44.646
You're here during work hours.

00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:48.233
Is there something going on?

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:52.654
Why are you being so serious, Heung-nam?

00:01:52.737 --> 00:01:53.863
"Coach."

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:56.282
Call me "Coach Bang."

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:57.742
- Dude.
- Hey.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:02.080
He's a coach. Coach Bang Heung-nam.

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:07.043
The reason I'm here is because…

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:13.174
As you know,

00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:16.177
Seok-bong hurt his back
when he used to play rugby,

00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:17.804
and he strained it again.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.685
Right. I have a bad back, as you know.

00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:25.019
Geez. What do I do?

00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:26.855
I told you not to overdo it.

00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:30.525
- I know.
- We'll get going, then.

00:02:30.608 --> 00:02:32.277
Goodness.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.570
Does it hurt here?

00:02:37.198 --> 00:02:38.992
I told you to be careful.

What's going on?

00:05:14.063 --> 00:05:15.231
- What is it?
- This can't be.

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:19.777
I see, the brackets are out.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.406
It's Daesang again.

HANYANG HIGH VS DAESANG HIGH.

00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:27.660
Daesang High!

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:31.663
Good, Sae-heon.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.835
Did you skip lunch? That was weak!

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:41.090
Hey, Tae-pung.

00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:43.634
You have to get lower, go for the waist.

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:44.802
Okay, sir!

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:47.013
Are they strong?

00:05:47.096 --> 00:05:48.514
They won last year's Nationals.

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:51.976
We lost the practice match to them
right before you got here.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.729
- It was 35 to 5.
- Still,

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:59.275
- we won the second half.
- Hey. You're just convincing yourself.

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:03.821
Hanyang.

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:06.282
What's our goal again?

00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:08.117
Winning the Nationals.

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:10.369
Winning the National Sports Festival.

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:14.040
I can't hear you.

00:06:14.123 --> 00:06:15.124
What's our goal?

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:18.628
- Winning the Nationals!
- Winning the Nationals!

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:21.297
Yes. Our goal is to dominate
the whole country.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.301
That means we have to beat Daesang High
at some point, no matter what.

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:28.846
Aren't you confident? Because I am.

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:38.189
We are strong!

00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:47.949
Beat Daesang!

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:51.577
Many college scouts will be coming
to see the athletes.

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:53.871
The scouts from pro teams
will be coming too.

00:06:54.455 --> 00:06:55.498
Win their hearts.

00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:56.582
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:59.544
Please do your best

00:06:59.627 --> 00:07:02.421
so our students can see
the fruits of their efforts.

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:07.677
If the players are equally skilled,
they'll pick ones they're familiar with.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.265
Pull all your strings and get them here
to show the students' matches.

00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:13.641
- Okay.
- Yes.

00:07:14.183 --> 00:07:18.020
The Shooting Team is ready to go.
Daehan Sport University is all set too.

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:21.524
I know Coach Jeon
has the Shooting Team covered.

00:07:23.776 --> 00:07:25.236
- Rugby.
- Yes.

00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:28.155
What's your plan?

00:07:30.491 --> 00:07:33.703
Coach Ju is practically shunned
in the rugby world.

00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:35.204
Is anybody going to come?

00:07:36.914 --> 00:07:39.250
We'll make them come somehow.

00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:45.923
Did you see
Myeongseong's admissions guideline?

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:47.049
I did.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.051
It's the same as last year.

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:52.096
It's 50% tournament results
and 50% interview.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.348
The interview's 50%? Then I have a chance.

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:55.349
Why's that?

00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:57.518
- I come across as likeable.
- Not really.

00:07:57.602 --> 00:07:59.729
- I can win points at the interview.
- No.

00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:02.899
If the interview's 50%,
it means they've got someone in mind.

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:05.568
- The interview doesn't matter.
- What?

00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:07.653
How can they pick someone
with just one interview?

00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:10.364
The scouts come to each match
for a reason.

00:08:10.948 --> 00:08:14.410
Do you intend to go to college
instead of joining a pro team, Captain?

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:18.122
I'll go anywhere
as long as I can play rugby.

00:08:20.708 --> 00:08:23.169
Snack time! Time to fuel up.

00:08:23.252 --> 00:08:24.712
It's chicken time!

00:08:24.795 --> 00:08:27.256
- Hey, Seon-ho.
- Snack time?

00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:36.307
Let's thank them first.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:40.061
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

00:08:40.144 --> 00:08:42.396
I made it with extra care today.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.481
Dive in!

00:08:43.564 --> 00:08:44.857
You're the best, Coach!

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:48.528
Hello! Today we're eating chicken!

00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:50.029
Chicken <i>mukbang!</i>

00:08:54.575 --> 00:08:56.953
Did you hear that?

00:08:57.036 --> 00:08:59.497
Its thin batter
makes it even more delicious.

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:01.707
It's the best. The best.

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:03.459
I could eat this all day.

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:06.254
When have you ever not, Seon-ho?

00:09:06.337 --> 00:09:07.380
Never.

00:09:09.131 --> 00:09:10.591
Let's just eat.

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:12.176
Coach, have some.

00:09:17.723 --> 00:09:19.058
It's good.

00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:20.601
Seok-bong cooks chicken well.

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:22.019
I wish he played rugby well too.

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:23.103
No more for you.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.524
So? How is rugby?

00:09:26.607 --> 00:09:27.650
It's fun.

00:09:30.611 --> 00:09:31.737
- Give it to me.
- What?

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:32.822
- Give it to me.
- Why?

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:36.909
Ung.

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:38.619
You're our hidden card.

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:39.703
What?

00:09:39.745 --> 00:09:43.374
Everyone's already good, but it's hard
to improve in a short period of time.

00:09:43.457 --> 00:09:44.834
But you're different.

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:48.671
You can get better infinitely
depending on how you train.

00:09:49.463 --> 00:09:51.257
Let's give it our all.

00:09:52.049 --> 00:09:53.676
Yes, I'll try my best.

00:09:57.096 --> 00:09:59.473
- Okay, listen while you're eating.
- Okay.

00:09:59.557 --> 00:10:03.311
When you're done eating,
split into two teams for a mini-game.

00:10:03.894 --> 00:10:06.522
We're one player short.
Coach, will you play as well?

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:09.025
I can't because I have something to do.

00:10:09.108 --> 00:10:10.484
Coach Ma will play instead.

00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:12.486
- Cool.
- Me?

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.323
- I'll borrow this for a bit.
- Am I really playing?

00:10:18.117 --> 00:10:19.660
Hello, Coach.

00:10:22.413 --> 00:10:23.413
Hey.

00:10:24.081 --> 00:10:25.916
- Is everything good?
- Yes.

00:10:27.418 --> 00:10:29.837
Have you seen my phone?

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:35.092
I found it while cleaning.

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.555
You finally know your place.

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:42.850
- What?
- Never mind.

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:47.229
You finally look like a coach.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.690
Thinking of your students.

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:53.653
That's the first step to becoming a coach.

00:10:55.529 --> 00:10:56.529
Good job.

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:03.037
But you didn't have
to widen the gap that much.

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:06.082
Why didn't you take the last shot?

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:07.416
To make sure you lost?

00:11:09.752 --> 00:11:10.836
It wasn't like that.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.507
Anyway, focus on coaching from now on.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:17.009
Don't think about
standing on the firing line.

00:11:17.093 --> 00:11:19.637
You know how important
the Presidents Cup is.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:24.558
You can renew your contract next year
only if they achieve good results.

00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:25.976
Do your best.

00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:29.855
Yes, sir.

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:31.107
Did you try calling me?

00:11:37.488 --> 00:11:40.324
- She's not in a good mood, is she?
- How could she be?

00:11:40.908 --> 00:11:43.661
Why did she screw up the match in the end?

00:11:43.744 --> 00:11:46.455
I have a feeling she did it deliberately.

00:11:47.164 --> 00:11:49.375
Thanks to Coach, she got qualified.

00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:51.460
No way.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.518
- Stop eating.
- I'll pay. I have money.

00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:10.187
Hey. Did I ask you for your money?

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:12.606
You'll choke at this rate.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.316
- I have this.
- Geez.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.360
Then at least take this.

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:20.990
- Will it cause a doping issue?
- No, so drink it.

00:12:24.118 --> 00:12:26.036
Actually, it doesn't matter anymore.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.164
- What?
- What do you mean?

00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:29.832
Are you going to retire?

00:12:29.915 --> 00:12:33.210
Does Ga-ram know about this?

00:12:33.711 --> 00:12:35.171
Why does he have to know?

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.591
- Well…
- He has nothing to do with me.

00:12:38.674 --> 00:12:41.343
He doesn't need to know what I'm doing.

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:44.472
And I don't want to know
anything about him, either.

00:12:45.723 --> 00:12:49.685
So don't go sharing any news about me
with him. He has nothing to do with me.

00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:35.814
More.

00:13:35.898 --> 00:13:37.733
Here you go.

00:13:37.816 --> 00:13:39.193
- Go away.
- Geez.

00:13:39.276 --> 00:13:40.736
Go away. You're bad luck!

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:43.238
Go away.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:46.534
Are you really going to be like this?

00:13:46.617 --> 00:13:48.827
Think about all the chicken
we ate together.

00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:49.911
Coach Ju.

00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:52.957
We have no interest
in Hanyang High's Rugby Team.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.875
So, we don't plan on watching their match.

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:57.586
We know Daesang High's players well.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.631
Watching from the second round
would be more than enough.

00:14:02.299 --> 00:14:06.387
Is it because our team is weak
or because I'm their coach?

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.638
Both.

00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:11.100
So stop wasting my time.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.729
You'll regret this.

00:14:17.606 --> 00:14:20.568
Myeongseong won't be seeing Daesang
in the Presidents Cup.

00:14:21.068 --> 00:14:21.902
Why, you ask?

00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:23.779
Because we'll beat them.

00:14:39.253 --> 00:14:41.297
SONG HYEON-JONG
YONHEE UNIVERSITY RUGBY COACH

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.380
Coach Song.

00:15:01.525 --> 00:15:03.360
Get straight to the point.

00:15:04.361 --> 00:15:06.405
This isn't pleasant for either of us.

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:10.284
I'm actually thrilled to see you.

00:15:13.662 --> 00:15:16.665
I heard you've been poking around.

00:15:17.291 --> 00:15:18.709
It's pointless.

00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:20.418
Why?

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.589
As long as you are their coach,

00:15:23.672 --> 00:15:27.551
no scout is going to watch
Hanyang High's match.

00:15:28.802 --> 00:15:30.679
I'm not asking you to take me back.

00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:33.891
The kids have done nothing wrong.

00:15:35.434 --> 00:15:38.437
They have you, someone reckless enough
to risk losing Olympic qualification

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.397
because of doping, as their coach.

00:15:41.231 --> 00:15:42.483
Are they really innocent?

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:47.071
That reckless someone

00:15:48.155 --> 00:15:51.200
loved rugby more than anyone in Korea,

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:53.077
did his best, and was good at it.

00:15:54.495 --> 00:15:55.621
Aren't you curious

00:15:56.372 --> 00:15:58.082
about the boys I have chosen?

00:15:58.832 --> 00:15:59.833
Chosen?

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:05.381
Hanyang High was the only school
that would accept you.

00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:07.131
No.

00:16:08.884 --> 00:16:11.470
I chose them.

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:14.098 line:20%
THREE MONTHS AGO.

00:16:14.765 --> 00:16:16.308
They're hopeless, aren't they?

00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:19.853
MUJIN: HANYANG

00:16:19.937 --> 00:16:22.022 line:20%
FIRST HALF 17:07
SECOND HALF 17:12.

00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:24.149 line:20%
- Nice.
- Let's go.

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:35.369
There you are.
Geez, I was looking for you.

00:16:35.452 --> 00:16:37.454
I thought you weren't coming.

00:16:38.372 --> 00:16:40.582
It's best to keep a low profile.

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:41.834
How was it?

00:16:42.418 --> 00:16:44.753
They did well for a team
without bench members.

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:48.465
They might have a chance next year
if they have more players.

00:16:49.049 --> 00:16:50.926
Will there be a rugby team next year?

00:16:52.636 --> 00:16:55.264
Some are trying to disband them.

00:16:55.347 --> 00:16:59.643
They're not getting good results
or any new players.

00:17:00.477 --> 00:17:01.562
It's a vicious cycle.

00:17:02.312 --> 00:17:05.232
They don't even have
a coach next semester.

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:11.238
Do you want me to find you one?

00:17:12.448 --> 00:17:13.448
Never mind.

00:17:14.658 --> 00:17:17.036
- Nobody will answer my calls.
- You should do it.

00:17:17.828 --> 00:17:19.955
- What?
- You should coach them.

00:17:20.914 --> 00:17:24.126
You said you're better now.
You just need to take care of yourself.

00:17:28.297 --> 00:17:30.549
Ms. Kang, did you forget who I am?

00:17:31.508 --> 00:17:33.177
I'm Ju Ga-ram.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.054
- Ga-ram the juicer.
- Also,

00:17:35.804 --> 00:17:39.308
you're the rugby player
who has won the most matches in Korea.

00:17:42.978 --> 00:17:46.815
What they need is a win.

00:17:47.399 --> 00:17:52.154
So they need someone
who will teach them how to win.

00:17:55.199 --> 00:17:57.326
<i>I had a lot on my mind for three years.</i>

00:17:58.952 --> 00:18:00.704
I thought it was unfair.

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.085
In the end, I was the one
who made the biggest mistake.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:09.630
The rugby spirit.

00:18:12.674 --> 00:18:15.385
I ended up like this
because I forgot about it.

00:18:17.221 --> 00:18:18.222
When you play rugby,

00:18:19.389 --> 00:18:21.100
you do it with your teammates.

00:18:22.309 --> 00:18:23.685
I forgot about that…

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:28.232
And tried to handle it all alone.

00:18:30.317 --> 00:18:32.277
And I realized this was the result.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:35.781
Now,

00:18:36.907 --> 00:18:38.700
I don't resent anyone.

00:18:49.586 --> 00:18:53.590
I'm teaching them
how to play together as a team first.

00:18:54.341 --> 00:18:57.636
They love rugby as much as you do.

00:18:59.346 --> 00:19:00.639
So?

00:19:04.309 --> 00:19:08.856
I have nothing to say,
even if you hate me with all your heart.

00:19:11.191 --> 00:19:12.191
But these boys…

00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:14.235
No.

00:19:15.779 --> 00:19:16.780
These players…

00:19:18.407 --> 00:19:20.617
Please, just give them a chance
without any prejudice.

00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:26.456
I beg of you.

00:19:55.903 --> 00:19:57.154
She's here.

00:19:57.863 --> 00:19:58.989
Hello.

00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:03.076
- Did she lose on purpose?
- Why else would she not shoot?

00:20:07.414 --> 00:20:09.124
Coach Bae is in trouble.

00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:12.085
- Why did she leave in the middle?
- Exactly.

00:20:12.628 --> 00:20:15.672
- What's going on in the Shooting Team?
- Seriously, right?

00:20:17.716 --> 00:20:19.885
Hey, what did you just say?

00:20:20.969 --> 00:20:23.013
I was just asking because I was curious.

00:20:23.597 --> 00:20:26.725
Why are you getting all worked up,
as if you did rig the match?

00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:35.400
I knew she'd do something like this.

00:20:45.535 --> 00:20:48.121
I don't know what you've heard,
but don't drag me into this.

00:20:48.205 --> 00:20:49.205
It's just strange.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:53.210
If that's not the case,
why didn't Coach take the last shot?

00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:55.587
You got qualified thanks to her.

00:20:55.671 --> 00:20:58.048
What? I got qualified because I was good.

00:20:58.131 --> 00:20:59.967
Stop talking nonsense
when you know nothing.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:01.051
Stop!

00:21:03.887 --> 00:21:09.393
Coach, she's saying we rigged the tryout,
but you know that's false. Tell her.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.703
You get a penalty
if you fight in the shooting lane.

00:21:27.786 --> 00:21:29.246
Five penalty points for both.

00:21:29.329 --> 00:21:31.123
- Coach!
- Step up to the firing line.

00:21:31.206 --> 00:21:32.457
It's training time.

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:34.376
Hurry.

00:21:39.464 --> 00:21:40.632
Darn it…

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.807
<i>Head Coach Jeon and Coach Bae,
come to the principal's office now.</i>

00:21:53.729 --> 00:21:56.189 line:20%
REQUEST TO CLEAR SUSPICION OF MATCH-FIXING.

00:21:56.857 --> 00:22:00.944
Why does my Seol-hyeon
have to face this kind of accusation?

00:22:01.028 --> 00:22:02.529
Tell me, Coach Bae.

00:22:05.949 --> 00:22:07.743
I didn't rig the match.

00:22:08.493 --> 00:22:11.413
That's true, Mr. Na.
This is a groundless accusation.

00:22:11.496 --> 00:22:13.999
It doesn't matter
whether it's groundless or not.

00:22:15.292 --> 00:22:17.669
The mere suspicion is a problem.

00:22:17.753 --> 00:22:19.588
Yes. You're right.

00:22:19.671 --> 00:22:20.839
My apologies.

00:22:21.423 --> 00:22:25.635
I should have taken
better care of the coaches.

00:22:26.303 --> 00:22:28.305
I'm not here for your apology.

00:22:29.222 --> 00:22:30.222
Coach Bae.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.143
- Yes.
- Give me an explanation.

00:22:34.269 --> 00:22:37.314
Why did you shoot the way you did
at the end?

00:22:39.775 --> 00:22:41.443
Explain it!

00:22:41.526 --> 00:22:44.988
Why is my daughter being dragged
into this filthy rumor?

00:22:48.033 --> 00:22:49.701
Tell him the truth.

00:22:50.952 --> 00:22:52.913
Do you want this
to be your retirement match?

00:22:52.996 --> 00:22:55.707
Think carefully,
unless you want to ruin your life.

00:23:02.923 --> 00:23:05.050
I wasn't feeling well.

00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:08.887
Due to what?

00:23:10.222 --> 00:23:14.518
To shoot that terribly,
you must have felt really unwell.

00:23:26.279 --> 00:23:30.242
Go to the Shooting Association
and explain everything.

00:23:34.371 --> 00:23:37.374
If you don't, I don't know what I'll do.

00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:17.121
Here.

00:24:18.123 --> 00:24:19.166
Thank you.

00:24:20.584 --> 00:24:21.668
Are you all right?

00:24:23.211 --> 00:24:24.211
Ms. Kang.

00:24:25.088 --> 00:24:27.632
I really didn't rig the tryout.

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:29.550
I know.

00:24:30.218 --> 00:24:31.928
You wouldn't do such a thing.

00:24:35.432 --> 00:24:36.432
Here.

00:24:39.519 --> 00:24:40.519
What is this?

00:24:41.479 --> 00:24:43.565
I heard the kids these days say,

00:24:44.107 --> 00:24:48.737
"Shake the carrot if you need help.
I'll come save you."

00:24:49.779 --> 00:24:51.698
I thought you might need help.

00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:55.285
How do you know such a thing?

00:24:57.996 --> 00:25:01.750
I don't hold much power
as I'm about to retire,

00:25:03.084 --> 00:25:04.377
but just say the word.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:08.381
I'll help you as much as I can.

00:25:12.552 --> 00:25:13.637
Thank you.

00:25:14.721 --> 00:25:16.514
I'll let you know when I need help.

00:25:19.351 --> 00:25:20.560
Shake the carrot.

00:25:33.448 --> 00:25:34.658
Bye.

00:25:40.705 --> 00:25:42.707
It's going to be a long day today.

00:25:44.584 --> 00:25:47.754
Hey, hurry. Don't make our senior wait.

00:25:49.923 --> 00:25:50.923
Let's go.

00:25:51.633 --> 00:25:57.222
I came to check on U-jin's training,
but I'm hearing a nasty rumor.

00:25:58.181 --> 00:26:00.183
KIM SO-HYEON, U-JIN'S MOM
FORMER NATIONAL SHOOTER

00:26:01.851 --> 00:26:04.187
Geez. You heard about that.

00:26:05.063 --> 00:26:08.024
You do have many connections
in the Shooting Association.

00:26:08.108 --> 00:26:10.568
It's nothing though. We'll sort it out soon.

00:26:11.903 --> 00:26:14.322
Why does she still lose energy
toward the end?

00:26:14.406 --> 00:26:16.741
Are you sure
your strength training is helping?

00:26:16.825 --> 00:26:21.788
So-hyeon, it's only a 0.8-point difference
from the player who placed first.

00:26:22.956 --> 00:26:24.124
Coach Jeon.

00:26:24.791 --> 00:26:28.211
You know how it is
because you used to be a player.

00:26:29.129 --> 00:26:32.465
Those 0.8 points make a big difference.

00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:35.010
What differentiates a gold medalist

00:26:36.136 --> 00:26:41.391
from a loser is often less than a point.

00:26:43.018 --> 00:26:44.060
You're right.

00:26:44.144 --> 00:26:47.147
We'll pay extra attention.

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:48.231
Right, Coach Bae?

00:26:48.857 --> 00:26:49.691
Yes.

00:26:49.774 --> 00:26:54.029
Will she continue to be the coach
in charge of U-jin?

00:26:54.112 --> 00:26:55.112
Pardon?

00:26:55.488 --> 00:27:00.327
A coach should help her players.

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:06.374
As of now, she doesn't seem
to be of much help to U-jin.

You missed recording
your weight for a few days.

00:27:20.388 --> 00:27:25.393
There's no weight division in shooting,
but an appropriate weight does exist.

00:27:25.477 --> 00:27:26.603
I'll be careful.

00:27:28.688 --> 00:27:32.275
Tell me about the first round
of the national tryouts.

00:27:32.984 --> 00:27:37.739
Your 26th and 54th shots
were especially problematic.

00:27:37.822 --> 00:27:40.200
I breathed shortly for the 26th.

00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:42.118
For the 54th…

00:27:49.084 --> 00:27:50.084
You couldn't focus.

00:27:51.586 --> 00:27:53.546
Were you thinking about something else?

00:27:59.844 --> 00:28:01.596
<i>- Blueberry smoothie.</i>
- Blueberry…

00:28:01.679 --> 00:28:03.431
Blueberry.

00:28:03.515 --> 00:28:05.433
Smoothie.

00:28:06.684 --> 00:28:07.769
I don't know.

00:28:07.852 --> 00:28:09.604
You're the one who took the shot.

00:28:09.687 --> 00:28:11.606
- Who else would know?
- Blueberry smoothie.

00:28:11.689 --> 00:28:12.982
Blueberry smoo…

00:28:14.859 --> 00:28:16.736
- Geez. Why is it so hard?
- I told you.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:19.948
- Blueberry smoothie.
- Every shot has to have a reason.

00:28:20.031 --> 00:28:21.671
- You have to think before...
- Blueberry…

00:28:23.076 --> 00:28:24.452
What is it?

00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:25.412
Sorry.

00:28:25.495 --> 00:28:26.788
I'm sorry.

00:28:30.667 --> 00:28:33.461
- Think before you shoot.
- Blueberry smoothie.

00:28:35.088 --> 00:28:36.673
Blueberry smoothie.

00:28:37.966 --> 00:28:40.760
You know what my dream is, U-jin.

00:28:41.344 --> 00:28:42.595
Don't let me down.

00:28:43.722 --> 00:28:44.722
Okay.

00:29:02.741 --> 00:29:03.741
I did good, right?

00:29:05.201 --> 00:29:07.912
You need to intervene
in someone's nagging to put an end to it.

00:29:10.999 --> 00:29:11.999
Was I not good?

00:29:13.001 --> 00:29:14.001
Well…

00:29:15.587 --> 00:29:16.921
It wasn't bad.

00:29:17.005 --> 00:29:19.549
Then I have a favor to ask.

00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:23.136
- What is it?
- "Blueberry smoothie."

00:29:23.219 --> 00:29:24.971
How do I say it in a Seoul dialect?

00:29:29.893 --> 00:29:30.977
It's not that hard.

00:29:31.644 --> 00:29:34.481
You just lower the center of your body.

00:29:34.564 --> 00:29:36.941
Think of tackling them below their thigh.

00:29:37.025 --> 00:29:40.904
Press your arms and body
firmly against theirs. Okay?

00:29:40.987 --> 00:29:41.905
Firmly.

00:29:41.988 --> 00:29:43.490
- Let's give it a try.
- This thigh…

00:29:43.573 --> 00:29:44.908
- Move, Seon-ho.
- Okay.

00:29:44.991 --> 00:29:45.992
Get ready.

00:29:46.743 --> 00:29:47.743
Okay.

00:29:51.748 --> 00:29:53.124
Lower…

00:29:53.208 --> 00:29:54.542
Nice.

00:29:54.626 --> 00:29:55.627
That's it.

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:57.504
You're a hundred times better
than Tae-pung.

00:29:57.587 --> 00:29:59.380
You definitely have good instincts.

00:29:59.464 --> 00:30:00.548
Remove the pad, Ju-yang.

00:30:03.134 --> 00:30:04.552
Now try it on a person.

00:30:05.261 --> 00:30:06.262
Okay?

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:10.558
- Seon-ho.
- Yes.

00:30:17.607 --> 00:30:18.983
We're good. You can do it.

00:30:22.779 --> 00:30:23.779
Let's try it.

00:30:27.617 --> 00:30:28.701
- Okay.
- Slowly.

00:30:36.668 --> 00:30:37.752
Hey, Coach.

00:30:40.046 --> 00:30:41.422
Hello, Coach.

00:30:41.506 --> 00:30:43.466
- Hey.
- Hello, Coach.

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:44.926
- Night training?
- Yes.

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:49.889
We've been training Ung.
He's making rapid progress.

00:30:50.557 --> 00:30:53.768
He'll soon play the role
of more than one person.

00:30:54.894 --> 00:30:56.980
By the way, Coach, you're wearing a suit.

00:30:57.063 --> 00:30:58.356
Yes.

00:30:59.357 --> 00:31:00.942
I had to.

00:31:01.025 --> 00:31:03.319
Can you wear that on match day?

00:31:03.403 --> 00:31:04.571
Why? Is it cool?

00:31:04.654 --> 00:31:06.414
- It looks like he's at a funeral.
- Exactly.

00:31:07.323 --> 00:31:10.201
It's going to be the end
for Daesang High that day.

00:31:12.745 --> 00:31:14.664
Myeong-u the Wise makes a comeback.

00:31:14.747 --> 00:31:17.250
- Do you want to beat them that badly?
- Of course.

00:31:17.333 --> 00:31:20.795
We'll never forgive the one
who abandoned us.

00:31:21.754 --> 00:31:23.006 line:20%
With my own hands, I'll…

00:31:24.507 --> 00:31:26.759
- All right, all right.
- Let's go crush them.

00:31:38.313 --> 00:31:40.440
STATEMENT

00:31:40.523 --> 00:31:41.523
I-ji.

00:31:41.941 --> 00:31:44.736
I'm craving something spicy.

00:31:44.819 --> 00:31:47.780
How about some chicken feet
before roll call?

00:31:47.864 --> 00:31:49.198
I'm busy.

00:31:52.785 --> 00:31:53.786
What are you doing?

00:31:56.122 --> 00:31:57.832
STATEMENT

00:31:57.916 --> 00:31:59.792
Are you going to the Association?

00:31:59.876 --> 00:32:01.461
What can I do? They told me to.

00:32:01.544 --> 00:32:03.922
- Was it because of Nak-gyun?
- No.

00:32:04.005 --> 00:32:05.298
Then what was it?

00:32:05.381 --> 00:32:07.050
Did your shoulder cramp up?

00:32:07.717 --> 00:32:09.719
Hey. That's a good excuse.

00:32:09.802 --> 00:32:10.887
I-ji!

00:32:11.554 --> 00:32:12.972
Was it because of Ga-ram?

00:32:13.056 --> 00:32:16.017
Do you want me to assassinate that jerk?

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.268
It wasn't him either.

00:32:17.352 --> 00:32:20.772
If it's neither of their fault,
you're the only reason left.

00:32:25.485 --> 00:32:27.737
I-ji, did you…

00:32:28.446 --> 00:32:29.739
Let's drop it, Seung-hui.

00:32:48.591 --> 00:32:52.595
All we have here is chicken.
Recharge your body for the summer with it.

00:32:55.098 --> 00:32:57.141
Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

00:32:58.935 --> 00:33:01.020
Right. I-ji was here, wasn't she?

00:33:01.104 --> 00:33:02.904
- Yes.
- Did you give her the digestive drink?

00:33:02.981 --> 00:33:06.359
I did. I did everything. You should eat.

00:33:08.695 --> 00:33:10.446
It has lots of healthy ingredients.

00:33:14.659 --> 00:33:16.411
How could you be eating right now?

00:33:16.995 --> 00:33:17.996
Honey, what's wrong?

00:33:18.079 --> 00:33:20.039
You shouldn't bother someone
when they're eating.

00:33:20.123 --> 00:33:23.418
That only applies to decent human beings.

00:33:23.501 --> 00:33:25.586
Ones who don't disappear for three years.

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:27.046
- Honey.
- What?

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:29.382
- I wasn't going to say this, but...
- Bong.

00:33:35.304 --> 00:33:36.639
I'll go get kimchi.

00:34:49.837 --> 00:34:50.671
Thank you.

00:34:50.755 --> 00:34:52.465
- Yes, enjoy.
- Thank you.

00:34:53.299 --> 00:34:56.385
- You're going to the Association tomorrow.
- Yes, I am.

00:34:56.469 --> 00:34:58.763
Make sure
there won't be any problems later.

00:34:58.846 --> 00:35:00.264
Yes. I'll make sure of it.

00:35:00.348 --> 00:35:02.642
Why did Coach Bae do that anyway?

00:35:03.684 --> 00:35:06.813
Was there really something wrong
with her body?

00:35:06.896 --> 00:35:11.943
She had no problem during the checkup.
But that was earlier this year.

00:35:12.026 --> 00:35:15.822
So she might have
developed an issue afterwards.

00:35:17.657 --> 00:35:19.742
While we're talking about checkups,

00:35:20.326 --> 00:35:24.330
Ga-ram went to the hospital
during work hours.

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:27.083
During work hours?

00:35:27.166 --> 00:35:28.835
- Yes.
- Why?

00:35:28.918 --> 00:35:31.921
He said his former teammate was sick.

00:35:32.004 --> 00:35:34.257
Seok-bong,
the one who runs a chicken place.

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:35.508
But I think he's lying.

00:35:36.384 --> 00:35:38.302
I have a hunch that's not the case.

00:35:40.471 --> 00:35:41.305
A hunch?

00:35:41.389 --> 00:35:44.225
You're talking about a hunch.
Are you kidding me?

00:35:44.308 --> 00:35:47.895
You have to bring concrete results.
I thought there was more to it.

00:35:48.563 --> 00:35:51.524
No. Keep looking into it.

00:35:51.607 --> 00:35:52.607
Okay.

00:36:17.133 --> 00:36:18.342
Ung.

00:36:19.051 --> 00:36:20.178
You haven't washed yet.

00:36:20.261 --> 00:36:22.180
I trained a bit more alone.

00:36:22.263 --> 00:36:24.223
Well done.

00:36:26.392 --> 00:36:28.019
What? What is it?

00:36:28.102 --> 00:36:29.187
Coach.

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.024
Tackling is important in rugby, right?

00:36:38.613 --> 00:36:39.613
Come in.

00:36:44.577 --> 00:36:45.745
Take a seat.

00:36:45.828 --> 00:36:47.038
Sit.

00:36:54.837 --> 00:36:56.047
Having trouble tackling?

00:36:59.967 --> 00:37:00.967
Are you afraid?

00:37:07.683 --> 00:37:08.976 line:20%
You ought to be afraid.

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.270
It requires a lot of courage

00:37:11.979 --> 00:37:16.150
to crash into someone with full strength,
knowing you might get hurt.

00:37:17.026 --> 00:37:19.946
But if you want to keep playing rugby,

00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:22.949
you have to overcome that fear.

00:37:24.242 --> 00:37:25.242
Okay?

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:32.959
Actually…

00:37:34.293 --> 00:37:36.170
- Hold on.
- Coach.

00:37:37.546 --> 00:37:38.714
What is it?

00:37:38.798 --> 00:37:40.091
What's going on?

00:37:40.174 --> 00:37:43.135
It's time for roll call,
but Coach Bae didn't come.

00:37:43.219 --> 00:37:46.222
What's wrong with her these days?

00:37:46.806 --> 00:37:48.099
I don't think she's in her room.

00:37:51.978 --> 00:37:53.604
Right.

00:37:53.688 --> 00:37:56.023
That's right. I'm an idiot.

00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:59.819
I was supposed to do it for her,
but I forgot.

00:38:00.611 --> 00:38:02.863
Sorry. Go upstairs and get ready.

00:38:02.947 --> 00:38:03.781
I'll be there soon.

00:38:03.864 --> 00:38:05.408
- Okay.
- Stupid.

00:38:05.491 --> 00:38:07.618
- Let's go.
- How stupid of me!

00:38:07.702 --> 00:38:10.621
It's time for roll call.
The others cleaned up for you.

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:13.874
Ung.

00:38:14.709 --> 00:38:16.294
I'll talk to you later.

00:38:16.377 --> 00:38:17.461
Would you?

00:38:19.005 --> 00:38:21.173
Don't worry, you can do it.

00:38:22.383 --> 00:38:24.176
Okay? Good luck.

00:38:24.719 --> 00:38:25.803
Okay.

00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:37.315 line:20%
BAE I-JI.

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:56.459
This is nothing.

00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:59.170
Just take one shot,

00:39:01.714 --> 00:39:02.714
like always.

00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:21.484
What are you doing?

00:39:23.319 --> 00:39:24.319
Stop it.

00:39:25.363 --> 00:39:26.906
You're in no condition to shoot.

00:39:26.989 --> 00:39:28.991
- Give it back.
- I know you.

00:39:29.575 --> 00:39:33.871
I can tell how you are and how you feel
just by looking at your shadow.

00:39:34.705 --> 00:39:36.332
So stop.

00:39:39.168 --> 00:39:40.252
I-ji!

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:43.672
You're right. I'm not all right.

00:39:44.382 --> 00:39:46.217
Are you here to rub that in?

00:39:46.967 --> 00:39:48.386
That's not what I mean.

00:39:48.469 --> 00:39:50.221
You know nothing about me.

00:39:51.138 --> 00:39:53.391
If you did, you would have looked
the other way.

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:56.227
You will never understand how I feel.

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:58.354
I ruined the match.

00:39:59.897 --> 00:40:02.024
People are even saying I rigged it.

00:40:03.901 --> 00:40:06.112
And then, you showed up.

00:40:09.198 --> 00:40:10.950
It's all your fault.

00:40:35.558 --> 00:40:38.352
That couldn't have been
my last match, right?

00:40:48.362 --> 00:40:49.989
Why would you say that?

00:40:51.323 --> 00:40:52.408
You don't know…

00:40:54.285 --> 00:40:55.411
What it's like to fear

00:40:56.996 --> 00:40:59.582
becoming useless overnight.

00:41:07.715 --> 00:41:08.715 line:20%
I feel the same.

00:41:12.845 --> 00:41:13.845
I'm afraid too.

00:41:57.014 --> 00:41:58.390
Tell them something was broken.

00:41:59.975 --> 00:42:01.810
- What?
- They won't believe you

00:42:01.894 --> 00:42:03.604
if you say you weren't feeling well.

00:42:04.939 --> 00:42:08.484
- We have to leave no doubts.
- And how do we do that?

00:42:08.984 --> 00:42:10.986
Should I break my wrist now?

00:42:12.363 --> 00:42:14.823
There's something they'll have to believe.

00:42:15.449 --> 00:42:16.449
The yips.

00:42:20.454 --> 00:42:22.206 line:20%
Tell them you had the yips.

00:42:22.289 --> 00:42:24.291 line:20%
What are they going to do?
They can't verify it.

00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:25.543 line:20%
Why…

00:42:26.544 --> 00:42:27.878 line:20%
Why would I have the yips?

00:42:27.962 --> 00:42:31.006
I'm not saying you have it.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:33.008
Just tell them that.

00:42:33.551 --> 00:42:36.428
What else are you going to say?
That you lost on purpose?

00:42:37.596 --> 00:42:40.808 line:20%
That will be the end for both of us.

00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:45.062 line:20%
Say that it was the yips for now.
You can say you recovered from it later.

00:42:45.145 --> 00:42:46.730 line:20%
You can come in now.

00:42:47.648 --> 00:42:48.648
Okay.

00:42:49.441 --> 00:42:50.441
Let's go.

00:42:54.154 --> 00:42:55.154
Hurry.

00:43:03.038 --> 00:43:04.915
KOREA SHOOTING ASSOCIATION

00:43:12.923 --> 00:43:14.216
Pause the video.

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:18.512
It's obvious she reduced the points
on purpose near the end.

00:43:19.638 --> 00:43:21.807
Thanks to that,
Na Seol-hyeon got qualified.

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:23.934
And it happened to be her student too.

00:43:25.185 --> 00:43:30.274
She didn't even shoot the last shot.
Her statement doesn't clear things up.

00:43:33.068 --> 00:43:37.698
Our players played the match
fair and square.

00:43:38.407 --> 00:43:40.451
What more can we say?

00:43:40.534 --> 00:43:42.202
She's saying that's not the case.

00:43:42.286 --> 00:43:46.290
If she can't give us a reasonable answer,
she could be suspended.

00:43:47.166 --> 00:43:49.627
The same goes for Na Seol-hyeon.

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:54.506
Sir, how could you suspend
such a promising young shooter?

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:57.926
Also, Seol-hyeon really had nothing
to do with this.

00:43:58.594 --> 00:43:59.595
Ms. Bae I-ji.

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:01.764
Do you have anything to say?

00:44:04.266 --> 00:44:07.895
<i>If it's neither of their fault,
you're the only reason left.</i>

00:44:07.978 --> 00:44:10.606
<i>There's something they'll have to believe.</i>

00:44:11.315 --> 00:44:12.316
<i>The yips.</i>

00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:15.694
Tell them the truth.

00:44:20.658 --> 00:44:23.619
It might be hard for her to say it herself.

00:44:23.702 --> 00:44:24.787
I-ji is actually

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:27.081
I don't know what more I can say.

00:44:28.791 --> 00:44:33.712
It sucks that I messed up the match.
Now I have to explain why I messed it up.

00:44:34.213 --> 00:44:35.339
When I…

00:44:36.799 --> 00:44:38.926
Started screwing up my points, I panicked.

00:44:41.136 --> 00:44:43.347
In the end, I couldn't even shoot.

00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:45.849
That's the end of the story.

00:45:00.614 --> 00:45:02.324
The Presidents Cup is approaching.

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:05.661
Pay extra attention
so that the players will maintain

00:45:05.744 --> 00:45:07.204
their best condition until then.

00:45:07.788 --> 00:45:08.788
Okay.

00:45:09.957 --> 00:45:12.543
And the coaches should take care
of themselves too.

00:45:12.626 --> 00:45:14.294
Like the players,

00:45:14.378 --> 00:45:18.048
please report any health issues
to the school.

00:45:18.132 --> 00:45:19.216
Okay.

00:45:21.844 --> 00:45:23.011
- Coach Ju.
- Yes.

00:45:24.847 --> 00:45:25.847
Do you understand?

00:45:26.598 --> 00:45:27.598
Yes.

00:45:37.818 --> 00:45:39.153
Ju Ga-ram.

00:45:39.236 --> 00:45:42.114 line:20%
ILLNESS: NONE.

00:46:13.729 --> 00:46:16.440
MUSCLE RELAXANT

00:46:29.786 --> 00:46:30.786
Shaky hands?

00:46:34.708 --> 00:46:35.876
Why can't you grab it?

00:46:38.587 --> 00:46:41.089
How could a former rugby player
have shaky hands?

00:46:49.473 --> 00:46:52.601
Geez, the Rugby Team is using up
all of the school's medicine.

00:46:52.684 --> 00:46:55.145
The rugby players get injured a lot.

00:46:55.229 --> 00:46:57.856
Exactly. The players get injured,
not their coach.

00:46:59.066 --> 00:47:00.066
What do you mean?

00:47:00.108 --> 00:47:03.028
Why were you at the hospital?
Especially during work hours?

00:47:03.111 --> 00:47:05.280
I already said
it was because of Seok-bong.

00:47:05.364 --> 00:47:07.115
Not because of you?

00:47:12.496 --> 00:47:15.165
I don't know what you're hiding,
but hide it well.

00:47:16.166 --> 00:47:17.251
Until someone finds out.

00:47:56.957 --> 00:47:58.250
Look at him go.

00:47:58.333 --> 00:48:01.253
- Let's make a bet. Losers do the laundry.
- Sounds good. I'm in.

00:48:03.839 --> 00:48:05.549
What? You said you were a monkey.

00:48:08.343 --> 00:48:09.511
Are you all right?

00:48:09.595 --> 00:48:10.596
Hey, are you okay?

00:48:10.679 --> 00:48:11.781
- Hyeong-sik.
- What's wrong?

00:48:11.805 --> 00:48:13.307
- Are you for real?
- What is it?

00:48:14.182 --> 00:48:15.350
- Damn.
- Are you all right?

00:48:15.434 --> 00:48:16.602
What's going on?

00:48:18.395 --> 00:48:20.355
I told you to stop.

00:48:20.439 --> 00:48:21.815
Hyeong-sik, what's wrong?

00:48:21.898 --> 00:48:22.983
- My shoulder.
- Shoulder?

00:48:23.066 --> 00:48:25.485
I think he dislocated it.
This will hurt, Hyeong-sik.

00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:28.196
Okay. It's all right. There.

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.115
One, two, three. Okay.

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:33.160
How does it look?

00:48:33.243 --> 00:48:35.954
- His ligament doesn't look too bad.
- Really?

00:48:38.415 --> 00:48:39.666
But be careful for a while.

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:41.918
- Okay.
- What happened?

00:48:43.211 --> 00:48:44.421
Will anyone explain?

00:48:45.422 --> 00:48:49.676
After getting ready for training,
we were playing around a bit.

00:48:54.306 --> 00:48:57.517
An athlete got injured
not during a match or training,

00:48:58.769 --> 00:49:00.354
but while playing around?

00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:06.360
Have you gone nuts?

00:49:07.903 --> 00:49:08.903
Have you?

00:49:11.239 --> 00:49:12.407
Even if you play it safe,

00:49:12.491 --> 00:49:17.537
in rugby, you never know when, how,
or what will force you to retire.

00:49:17.621 --> 00:49:19.373
Do you know how it feels

00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:21.792
to be abandoned because of an injury?

00:49:26.421 --> 00:49:27.422
You feel like dying.

00:49:31.385 --> 00:49:32.386
You want to die.

00:49:34.429 --> 00:49:35.429
Why, you ask?

00:49:38.892 --> 00:49:40.394
Because it's living hell.

00:50:25.021 --> 00:50:26.982
ANADROL

00:51:08.106 --> 00:51:09.106
Yes?

00:51:12.986 --> 00:51:15.155
I-ji, what is it? Is everything all right?

00:51:15.739 --> 00:51:17.407
It's roll call soon.

00:51:17.491 --> 00:51:18.909
Take care of your boys.

00:51:28.418 --> 00:51:29.628
What are you guys doing?

00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:34.341
What is this?

00:51:35.467 --> 00:51:36.301
Rugby Team.

00:51:36.384 --> 00:51:37.886
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:51:39.638 --> 00:51:41.681
What are you doing?

00:51:45.519 --> 00:51:46.520
Raise your heads.

00:51:54.986 --> 00:51:56.404
- Sorry, Coach.
- Sorry.

00:51:56.488 --> 00:51:57.823
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

00:51:57.906 --> 00:51:59.741
- Sorry, Coach.
- We messed up.

00:51:59.825 --> 00:52:01.451
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

00:52:04.913 --> 00:52:06.456
We won't mess around anymore.

00:52:07.958 --> 00:52:10.752
- There won't be a next time.
- It's all my fault.

00:52:10.836 --> 00:52:12.587
It was all me.

00:52:12.671 --> 00:52:14.506
We won't play around anymore.

00:52:15.632 --> 00:52:16.758
No.

00:52:17.884 --> 00:52:18.969
I'm sorry.

00:52:20.887 --> 00:52:22.556
I went overboard today.

00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:26.226
Please forget about it.

00:52:30.272 --> 00:52:33.108
No, Coach.
I should have stopped that monkey.

00:52:33.191 --> 00:52:34.025
I'm so sorry.

00:52:34.109 --> 00:52:35.443
I'm sorry.

00:52:35.527 --> 00:52:37.404
I should have stopped him. Sorry.

00:52:37.487 --> 00:52:38.655
I'm even more sorry.

00:52:38.738 --> 00:52:40.490
- No, I'm sorry.
- I'm even more sorry.

00:52:40.574 --> 00:52:42.492
- It's our fault.
- I should have known better.

00:52:42.576 --> 00:52:43.577
Stop.

00:52:46.371 --> 00:52:47.914
Are you going to skip roll call?

00:52:49.082 --> 00:52:52.168
- You shouldn't skip it.
- Right, roll call.

00:52:52.252 --> 00:52:54.212
- You're dismissed now.
- Dismissed!

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:56.256
- Hey, hurry.
- Go.

00:52:56.339 --> 00:52:57.841
- We'll buy you chicken.
- Go!

00:52:57.924 --> 00:52:58.924
Hurry.

00:52:59.801 --> 00:53:00.969
Chicken coming up!

00:53:01.052 --> 00:53:02.137
Thank you.

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:03.263
Go, I said!

00:53:05.223 --> 00:53:07.183
Go. Three, two…

00:53:16.651 --> 00:53:18.445
Hey. We need to talk.

00:53:19.195 --> 00:53:21.907
- About what?
- Just… I have something to give you too.

00:53:39.382 --> 00:53:41.176
It must have been tough
at the Association.

00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:45.847
Geez. You can never get used to
that place, right?

00:53:45.931 --> 00:53:47.891
That's because of all your wrongdoings.

00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:51.394
That's true.

00:53:56.107 --> 00:53:57.359
About that tryout

00:53:57.442 --> 00:53:58.735
I didn't rig it.

00:53:58.818 --> 00:54:00.820
I know. Just don't let it get to you.

00:54:00.904 --> 00:54:01.988
It's already over.

00:54:05.241 --> 00:54:06.241
Here.

00:54:08.954 --> 00:54:10.288
I said I had something for you.

00:54:20.256 --> 00:54:21.256
These are…

00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:25.971
Cover your ears for now.
They'll say whatever they want.

00:54:26.054 --> 00:54:28.556
Things like you rigged the match
or you've lost your touch.

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:30.392
Just cover your ears.

00:54:32.143 --> 00:54:33.436
Were these from you?

00:54:35.605 --> 00:54:37.816
No. I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:54:42.028 --> 00:54:45.448
Let me know if you lose them.
I have lots of them.

00:54:46.825 --> 00:54:48.368
Why would you have a lot?

00:54:49.119 --> 00:54:53.415
I bought lots of them
because I thought you'd need them

00:54:54.124 --> 00:54:55.625
during your time as a player.

00:55:03.049 --> 00:55:04.050
I

00:55:06.761 --> 00:55:08.555
I just don't get you.

00:55:11.224 --> 00:55:13.768
Why did you have to leave me like that
three years ago?

00:55:13.852 --> 00:55:16.104
I wondered why for three years.

00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:18.523
Were you tired of me?

00:55:18.606 --> 00:55:22.861
Or were you embarrassed by me
because I wasn't a good enough player?

00:55:24.195 --> 00:55:25.989
It wasn't like that, I-ji.

00:55:26.072 --> 00:55:27.073
Then…

00:55:27.699 --> 00:55:28.908
Then what on earth was it?

00:55:31.327 --> 00:55:32.412
Hold on, I-ji.

00:55:33.621 --> 00:55:35.248
Are you going to run away again?

00:55:35.331 --> 00:55:36.875
Stop right there, Ga-ram.

00:55:36.958 --> 00:55:38.084
Ga-ram!

00:55:46.384 --> 00:55:48.219
Ga-ram, hey.

00:55:49.804 --> 00:55:51.556
Ga-ram, what is it?

00:55:52.932 --> 00:55:55.143
What's wrong, Ga-ram?

00:55:55.977 --> 00:55:57.812
Open your eyes, Ga-ram.

00:55:57.896 --> 00:55:58.772
Ga-ram.

00:55:58.855 --> 00:56:00.356
Open your eyes.

00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:03.234
What's wrong, Ga-ram?

00:56:03.902 --> 00:56:05.695
Wake up.

00:56:06.571 --> 00:56:07.571
Ga-ram.

00:56:08.281 --> 00:56:09.281
Ga-ram!

00:57:06.673 --> 00:57:08.258
Myasthenia Gravis.

00:57:13.054 --> 00:57:15.223
Is that why you disappeared
three years ago?

00:57:22.564 --> 00:57:24.899
Is this the truth behind
Ga-ram, the juicer?

00:57:53.553 --> 00:57:54.387 line:20%
EPILOGUE.

00:57:54.471 --> 00:57:55.513 line:20%
THREE YEARS AGO.

00:57:55.597 --> 00:57:56.597 line:20%
Ga-ram!

00:58:02.937 --> 00:58:04.063
How did you get here?

00:58:04.147 --> 00:58:05.356
Your match is coming up soon.

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:06.816
I missed you.

00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:08.318
Let's eat. Do you have time?

00:58:08.985 --> 00:58:09.985
Let's go.

00:58:12.989 --> 00:58:14.824
I shot all tens this afternoon.

00:58:15.408 --> 00:58:17.202
The target looked this big.

00:58:17.869 --> 00:58:21.748
At this pace, I'll qualify for
the national tryouts without a problem.

00:58:23.833 --> 00:58:27.587
This time, I really want
to wear the national flag,

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:30.715 line:20%
win some medals, and enjoy
what they call the prime of my life.

00:58:31.466 --> 00:58:33.009
- I-ji.
- Yes?

00:58:36.763 --> 00:58:37.764
Apparently, I'm unwell.

00:58:39.682 --> 00:58:41.100
What? What's wrong?

00:58:41.684 --> 00:58:43.019
Is it the knee you hurt before?

00:58:43.853 --> 00:58:45.480
It shouldn't still hurt.

00:58:46.147 --> 00:58:48.107
What? Did you hurt your arm?

00:58:48.191 --> 00:58:49.943
- Let me see your shoulder.
- No.

00:58:54.989 --> 00:58:56.991
It hurts right here.

00:58:59.244 --> 00:59:01.246
I told you not to make jokes like that.

00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:13.508
Aren't you coming?

00:59:14.717 --> 00:59:15.717
I'm coming.

00:59:43.246 --> 00:59:46.249
THE WINNING TRY

00:59:46.332 --> 00:59:49.627 line:20%
<i>It's not that he didn't trust you.
He didn't want to be a burden.</i>

00:59:49.711 --> 00:59:53.047 line:20%
<i>This is their last chance.
I can't let them miss it.</i>

00:59:53.131 --> 00:59:55.633 line:20%
What if they find out
you're risking your life for them?

00:59:55.717 --> 00:59:58.261 line:20%
<i>There's something suspicious.</i>

00:59:58.344 --> 01:00:01.681 line:20%
<i>You're the vice principal, aren't you?
I'm interested in Coach Ju.</i>

01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:04.601 line:20%
<i>Yoon Seong-jun and six others
are ready for the Presidents Cup.</i>

01:00:04.684 --> 01:00:05.684 line:20%
What is our goal?

01:00:05.727 --> 01:00:07.478 line:20%
Winning the Nationals!

01:00:08.313 --> 01:00:09.731 line:20%
- What?
- There are no seats.

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:12.692 line:20%
What can you do with no subs?

01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:15.612 line:20%
If you put in effort for a goal,
you can't fail.

01:00:15.695 --> 01:00:17.572 line:20%
<i>We are bound to win.</i>

01:00:23.536 --> 01:00:25.538 line:20%
