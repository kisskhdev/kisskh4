00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.960
(Adapted from the novel
"Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.000
(Episode 22,
I Want to Bring You Home)

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.479
Men are just
easily understandable beings

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.240
They're not unusual at all

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.280
I think he understood it.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
That was fast.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.640
Chi Cheng is here.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.000
Why are you standing here?

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.240
Welcoming you.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.200
- Don't play tricks with me.
- Come in.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.080
I wouldn't dare.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.679
I've fixed all
the electrical appliances.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.120
It's rare for people to visit.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.680
How can I not be excited?

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.520
Since you're bored,
learn your lesson.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.800
Stay away from Chi Cheng
from now on.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.920
Mr. Chi.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.680
When do you plan...

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.640
to let me go home?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.520
When you've come to your senses...

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.680
and decided to cut ties
with Chi Cheng,

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.760
I'll let you go home.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.520
Well...

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.640
Well, you can't...

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.680
stay with me
for the rest of your life.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.759
You're a good young man.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.320
Why do you have perverted thoughts
in your head?

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.760
Mr. Chi.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.360
Look.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.240
Look how perverted I am.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.000
Please let me go.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.960
That's your real goal, isn't it?

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.120
You're bored, right?

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.720
Come on a business trip with me.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.640
I'll tour you
around advanced companies.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.120
Learn from their experience.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.040
Suddenly, it doesn't seem
so boring anymore.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.520
Let's go.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.160
What's wrong?

00:03:35.161 --> 00:03:36.360
My stomach hurts.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.760
I need to go to the restroom.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.840
Just five minutes.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.480
Hurry up.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.600
I'm sorry, Mr. Chi.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.440
Let's go for a drink at night.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.640
Why are there bodyguards?

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.080
He's hiding someone indeed.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.640
What should I do?

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.040
I have to think of a way to escape.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.160
Gosh!

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.840
There are no bodyguards anymore.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.160
The heavens are helping me.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.680
Move.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.440
What... What are you doing here?

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.479
Where exactly is Wu Suo Wei?

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.399
Is this how you treat your dad?

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.759
How should I treat you then?

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.199
Are you doing
what a dad should be doing?

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.359
What did you say? Say it again.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.656
I said what you're doing
is not what a dad should be doing!

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.560
Then are you doing
what a man should be doing?

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.320
Mr. Chi, please don't be angry.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.319
Young Master Chi didn't mean it.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.200
There's nothing a dad and son
can't talk about.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.920
Let's go.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.960
Don't be mad, Mr. Chi.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.520
Dad.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.640
There's a problem with my attitude.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.120
Look.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.520
You already have gray hair.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.240
I'll pluck it out for you.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.880
Look.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.520
You should get more rest.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.480
I'll get going.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.759
Got it.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.560
Mr. Chi, Wu Suo Wei got away.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.240
Chi Cheng, my "very good" son!

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.760
Drink slowly.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.120
Do you want more?

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.840
Da Wei.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.919
- Xiao Shuai.
- You're finally back.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.320
Did you miss me?

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.359
You know what, Xiao Shuai?

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.759
In the past few days,
I've suffered so much.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.280
- Xiao Shuai.
- Da Wei, I missed you so much.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.120
Da Wei, you know what?

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.799
I was the one who cracked
the codes you sent.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.919
Really?

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.960
If it weren't for me,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.359
you might not be able to come back.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.840
Xiao Shuai.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.200
Chi Cheng.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.000
Your dad is really ruthless.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.720
It's not his dad's fault.

00:06:52.721 --> 00:06:53.999
His dad didn't want to hit me.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.640
It's those three men's fault.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:56.960
Da Wei.

00:06:56.961 --> 00:06:58.959
At this state,
why are you still defending him?

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:59.960
Shuai Shuai.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.880
It's none of your business.
Stay out of it.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.200
How dare you yell at me here?

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.320
I'm sorry.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.239
- Come and sit down.
- He ran around all day, right?

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.440
He's so sweaty.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.120
Let him take a shower first
and get some rest.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.480
Let's go home first. Okay?

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.880
Do I stink?

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.040
Who said you stink?

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.760
You don't stink.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.479
Do you have other injuries?

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.520
No.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.040
I just sprained my ankle.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.960
Other than that,
I just have minor scratches.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.000
You've suffered, Wei Wei.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.440
It's okay.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.480
What does the code you sent me mean?

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.160
Block 520,

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.560
No. 8.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.800
If Jiang Xiao Shuai can't guess it,
you can't too?

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.200
Right.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.840
You're right.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.080
My brain...

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.599
doesn't work well.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.920
All right?

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.880
In that case,

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.920
I have to be in charge...

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.520
of this family.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.800
All right.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.000
You call all the shots.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.320
Sounds good.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.760
From now on,

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.520
you'll be the bottom.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.080
I'll be the top.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.720
Don't even think about it.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.280
Why not?

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:37.960
Because...

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.520
I'm handicapped.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.160
It's like...

00:08:42.161 --> 00:08:44.361
a left-handed person
being unable to use his right hand.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.000
Someone who has flat feet
can't walk for too long.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.080
Listen, I'll never be
the bottom in this lifetime.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.600
That's nonsense.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.680
You're a jerk
who's full of nonsense!

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.359
Fine.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.000
I'm a jerk.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.720
Chi Cheng!

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Mr. Wu, slowly.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.320
Mr. Wu, be careful.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.000
Let me do it, Mr. Wu.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.079
You guys can't draw it well.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.920
Only the letter C I draw looks good.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.880
Mr. Wu, please be careful.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.960
I'm fine.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.600
Okay. That's all for now.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.040
I got it.

00:09:22.041 --> 00:09:23.801
When I get to the office,
I'll call you back.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:28.960
Wei Wei.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.920
What are you doing up there?

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.080
They missed writing "CC".
I'm filling it in.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:37.920
Who let him go up there?

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.080
There was a problem
with the drawing.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.040
Mr. Wu insisted
on going up there himself.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.480
I called him down many times,
but he wouldn't come down.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.000
Young Master Chi, look...

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.160
He won't come down until he's done.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.400
It's done, right?

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.640
It's done.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.560
Be careful, Mr. Wu.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.880
- Be careful.
- Be careful.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.720
Okay.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.840
Why are you holding me?

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.320
There are so many people watching.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.360
From now on,
I'll do this kind of thing.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.920
Come on, take a look.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.800
If this show is a success,

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.080
our company can make
a name for itself in the industry.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.640
And I can live a luxurious life too.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.240
Then can you increase my allowance?

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.640
You want a raise in your allowance?

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.360
Scold me while sitting down.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.480
Are you shielding me from the sun?

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.200
I'm afraid you'll get tanned
like Jiang Xiao Shuai.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.880
You dislike
Jiang Xiao Shuai so much.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.679
When he was spouting nonsense
about the code back then,

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.880
didn't you teach him a lesson?

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.040
Of course I did.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.360
I used something
on Jiang Xiao Shuai,

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.000
then lured Guo Cheng Yu away,
so he just booked a ride home.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.639
Goodness.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.320
You're so ruthless.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:43.959
(Shuai Shuai)

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.160
Godfather, smell it.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.480
It smells quite good.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.480
It's purely plant-based.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.560
It's for scalp treatment.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.680
It seems reliable.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.440
They say it's really good.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.359
Mix it more.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.640
- Let me try.
- All right.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.200
Got it.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.880
It was my mom.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.200
She said after a couple of days,

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.400
she's bringing my sister and nephew
back to the country.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.120
Shouldn't you go home
and be with them then?

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.240
Don't tell me
you don't even want to go home?

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.520
It's not that
I don't want to go home.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.720
I want to bring you home with me.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.200
Stop joking around.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.840
If your dad could accept me,

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.640
he wouldn't have kidnapped me.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.999
No matter what,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.320
they are your family.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.720
Go home and check on them.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.040
Last time, because of me,

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.840
you and your dad
had a major conflict.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.480
I think you should apologize to him.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.360
Wait.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.880
He kidnapped you.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.720
Why should I apologize to him?

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.080
When I was at your house,

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.839
I was actually okay.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.919
Your dad...

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.120
was also nice to me.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.200
That's just on the surface.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.880
He's a shrewd businessman.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.320
He's subtle,

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.720
but lethal.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.720
Just go home and apologize to him.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.960
Things can't be awkward between you
and your family because of me.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.200
I'm not going.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.440
You...

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.360
Fine.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.960
I'll go.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.560
I'll go home.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.280
All right?

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.080
Don't worry.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.000
I'll make sure
your parents accept me.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.640
You'll be home alone
for the next two days.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.400
- Let's go to bed.
- Let's sleep.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.839
I'm sorry, Mr. Chi.
There's a problem with the car.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.719
- What's wrong with it?
- It might have broken down.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.600
But they've already sent
a new car over.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.160
You might have to wait for a while.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.800
Dad.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.760
I'll give you a ride.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.160
I don't need a ride from you.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.600
Mr. Chi, the car might
take a while to come.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.520
Why don't you ride
in Young Master Chi's car first?

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.480
Do you need a ride?

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.400
Remember to take this later.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.840
There's no need.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.160
- Mr. Chi, good morning.
- Good morning.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.760
Was that your son?
Did he drive you here?

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.360
My car broke down.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.720
My son was worried
and insisted on giving me a ride.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.399
I'm so jealous.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.400
Dad.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.520
You forgot this.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.880
Remember to take it.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.320
What is this?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.639
My son bought me hangover medicine.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.400
He's afraid I'll get drunk
and cause trouble.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.080
- Are you crazy?
- Are you crazy?

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.080
You're so sweet.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.160
Carry on.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.679
Did you tell him the passcode too?

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:38.840
No.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.559
Did we leave the door open?

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.800
Hey, Chi Cheng.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.560
I'll sleep over
at Xiao Shuai's place.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.440
Spend time with your family at home.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.640
Okay.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.920
You guys carry on.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:57.920
You're here.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.400
How can I continue?

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.560
You're right.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.080
This blanket is nice.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.440
I'll sleep in the second bedroom.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.480
Da Wei.

00:17:16.481 --> 00:17:18.000
Cheng Yu bought that for me.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.040
It's okay. I'll buy you another one.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.320
Think of it as a gift for the dog.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.199
I want to watch this.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.519
This isn't good. Watch this.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.520
Don't shake it.

00:17:30.521 --> 00:17:32.600
- Watch this.
- You won't behave?

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.559
- Change it back.
- No.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.160
- Today, what if...
- Go away!

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.879
You've been at it for a week.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.400
Hurry up. Change it back.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.480
You're the best.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.040
Give me a kiss then.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.760
Xiao Shuai, I'm going home.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.640
Don't.

00:18:08.641 --> 00:18:10.000
Are we disturbing you?

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:11.840
No.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.400
I can't sleep...

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.440
because it's not my bed.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.520
Stop talking nonsense, Da Wei.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.600
You stayed at the clinic
for so long.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.600
You slept well,
even if it wasn't your bed.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.360
I could sleep in other beds before.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:27.840
But I can't now.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.280
I'll get going.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.560
Starting tonight until tomorrow,

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.640
there will be heavy rainfall
in the city.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:54.959
Darn it.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.320
Did I leave some clothes out?

00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.320
I almost forgot.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.120
We have a dryer now.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.440
There's no need
to bring the clothes in.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.080
Mom will be pleased
if she knows that.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.359
Dad, I want this high one.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.360
Okay.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.439
- I can't reach it.
- I'll go higher.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.840
Dad, higher.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.719
Until when are you
going to play around?

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.760
All these years,
you've dated one guy after another.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.600
Do you still remember
how many people you've harmed?

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.560
Forget about the past.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.040
From now on,

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.600
there's only Wu Suo Wei.

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.360
Are you too lovestruck?

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.080
How can you say such nonsense?

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.120
It's not nonsense, Dad.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.040
I'm a man of my word.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.520
Then tell me.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.720
What do you two
want to do in the future?

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.800
When people point fingers at you
behind your backs,

00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.120
what are you going to do?

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.600
When you're old
and have no children,

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.760
what will you do then?

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.040
Why should I care
about other people's feelings, Dad?

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.160
About having kids,

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.360
while we're still young,
we'll earn more money.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.360
When we're old,
we might be happier...

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.320
hiring someone to take care of us.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.440
Take you as an example.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.240
Having a son like me,

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.320
isn't it more worrying?

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.840
You just want to go against me.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.320
Dad.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.400
I don't intend to go against you.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.480
Yes.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:49.880
I was immature before.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.720
I acted recklessly.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.120
But Wu Suo Wei and I
are working hard for the future now.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.200
Opening a company is the best proof.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.640
Dad.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.760
Please trust me this time.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.519
Your small company...

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.040
won't amount to anything.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.320
You even want to use it
as retirement insurance?

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.240
You're ignorant of your limitations.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.160
You know what?

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.480
I came here today...

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.360
because Wu Suo Wei asked me
to spend more time with you.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.640
But I realized...

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.760
that you don't need it.

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.280
Who's that?

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.200
Are you scared?

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.160
Who's scared?

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.160
Fine.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.680
I was so scared.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.680
I was scared you won't come back
once you were gone.

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:08.840
Wei Wei.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:13.880
Don't worry.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.040
I'm back now, right?

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:26.920
It's good that you're back.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.279
Dou Dou, we're home.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.400
Come and see your grandpa.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.919
Jia Li, stay longer this time.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.360
- Don't rush back.
- Okay.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.720
Where's Dad?

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.480
Grandpa!

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.280
Dou Dou!

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.279
I missed you so much.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.159
Dad, I'll unpack first
and take a shower.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.216
- You guys have fun.
- Okay.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.799
- I'll come down soon.
- You must be tired, Jia Li.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.919
Did you think of me?

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.600
- Yes.
- How did you miss me?

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.440
With your little head...

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.000
or with your heart?

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:04.920
Dou Dou.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:06.680
Are you done hiding?

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.560
Grandpa, I'm ready.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.959
Okay. I'm coming!

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.880
I'll catch you soon.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.640
I'll catch you
and pinch your little face.

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.240
Dou Dou.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.400
Dou Dou.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.200
I really can't find you.
Where are you hiding, Dou Dou?

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.280
- Dou Dou.
- Grandpa, I'm here!

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.120
You're there!

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.240
You hid so well.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.880
Grandpa, you're so silly.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.240
Dou Dou, where did you hide?

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.160
Where did you hide?

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.360
- Tell me.
- Dou Dou.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.400
Uncle!

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.200
Did you miss me?

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.560
Yes, I did.

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:03.640
Dad, Mom.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.840
Let's eat.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.560
Dou Dou.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:08.960
Dou Dou.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.080
Is Dou Dou here?

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.640
He's not here.

00:27:12.641 --> 00:27:14.319
Weren't you playing
hide-and-seek just now?

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.640
Dou Dou is missing.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000
What?

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.879
- Dou Dou!
- Dou Dou!

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.199
- Dou Dou!
- Dou Dou!

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.639
- Dou Dou!
- Come to me!

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.879
Stop hiding, Dou Dou!

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.639
I checked the attic
and every toilet. He's not there.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.079
We searched
the front and back yards.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.120
He's not there either.

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:32.000
How can you lose him
by playing hide-and-seek?

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.160
I'm speechless.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.719
Did Chi Cheng take him away?

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.120
He came back this afternoon.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.680
(Chi Cheng)

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.840
Jia Li, I took Dou Dou
out for a while.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.160
I can't believe Chi Cheng.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.519
I'll go get my grandson now.

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:52.720
That's enough. Don't go.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.719
You always fight
when you see each other.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.959
You might scare the kid again.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:56.960
I'll go.

00:27:56.961 --> 00:27:58.000
It's fine.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.240
I'll go.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.400
You fell asleep.

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.600
You're home.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.400
I brought you a present.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.720
A present? What is it?

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.240
He's so cute.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.080
Where did you get him?

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.640
Don't touch me.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.000
I love you so much.

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.399
What can I do?

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.920
Knock it off.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.360
What does that mean?

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:36.840
He said,

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.400
"Stop that."

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.440
- Really?
- Yes.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.320
Let's go. I'll show you
a magic trick, okay?

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.519
You've never
seen this before, right?

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.679
Come on, take a look.

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:49.840
Which one do you like?

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.799
That little deer.

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.039
Okay.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.360
Here you go.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.280
Take it.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.360
What else do you want?

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:03.279
- That gourd.
- Okay.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.280
Here you go.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.776
- You're quite greedy.
- Whatever you like,

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.120
I'll give them all to you.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.719
That's because you're so cute,

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.240
Dou Dou.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:13.800
Try and see if it's sweet.

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.320
It's sweet, right?

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:17.359
Yes.

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.560
You're so cute.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.080
Dou Dou.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.960
Come home with me, okay?

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.160
I want to play with Aunt.

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.360
Aunt?

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:39.960
Dou Dou.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.520
Go home with your mom.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.439
The next time
your uncle and I visit you,

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.519
we'll bring you
a lot of sugar figures, okay?

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.840
You can eat them all at once.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Okay.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:49.880
Be good and go home.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:51.600
Let's go. Come home with me.

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.320
Come on.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.439
- Let's go.
- See you next time, Dou Dou.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.520
Bye!

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.320
Dad, it's so late.
Why are you still up?

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:14.960
Where's Dou Dou?

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.520
He's asleep.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.720
Chi Cheng didn't come back with you?

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.240
No.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.600
Have a seat.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.440
Let's talk about your brother.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.080
Is he still living with that kid?

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.879
Dad, I think
it's Chi Cheng's right...

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.680
to choose the kind
of partner he wants.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.080
Your forceful interference
is a bit disrespectful to him.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.280
I don't respect him?

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.520
Does he respect me?

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.880
I have to put up
with strange looks from people.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.840
I can't even hold my head up
in front of others.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.240
I think those people
have nothing better to do.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.881
What do other people's
relationships have to do with them?

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.160
Society is becoming
more and more open-minded now.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.040
Why don't you try
to change your perspective?

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.520
That's enough.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.440
I'm going to rest.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.800
Your mom and I
didn't raise you and your brother...

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.640
just to get a slap on our faces...

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:17.960
when we get old.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.799
- What?
- It's raining.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.520
- Hold on.
- Here.

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.239
Someone reported Chi Cheng's company
for tax evasion.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.280
He was just taken away.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.360
He needs to cooperate
with the investigation.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.199
Could there be a misunderstanding?

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.000
Why would Chi Cheng do such a thing?

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:44.080
Where's the evidence?

00:31:44.081 --> 00:31:45.360
Mom, don't be anxious first.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.680
Please ask for more details, okay?

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.240
I told you,
his company is unreliable.

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:55.040
What can that rascal do?

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.320
And Wu Suo Wei is always so stingy.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.520
He must have cooked the books,
embezzled taxes,

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:01.840
and gotten my son into trouble.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.760
My right eyelid is twitching.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.640
It's probably a sign of wealth.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:22.960
Hello?

00:32:22.961 --> 00:32:24.600
Da Wei, I have something
to tell you.

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:27.400
Chi Cheng was taken
to the police station.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:28.840
What?

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.800
Don't worry too much.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.040
He's just cooperating
with the investigation.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.360
Maybe in the end,
it's just nothing, right?

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.480
He was taken away.
How can it be for nothing?

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.880
This won't do.
I'll go to the office now.

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.400
- Take a look at this.
- This one.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.200
This one is fine too.

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.000
They're all here.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.319
- There's no problem.
- Look at this one again.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.680
Look at the next one.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.080
These are fine too.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.320
- I'll check again.
- Take this over there.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.439
Ma'am, take a look.

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.640
Mr. Chi and our Finance Director
are counting on you.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.760
We can't rush it. We have to check
the accounts one by one.

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:09.880
Give me some time.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.119
Why are some tax returns
a bit different...

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.520
from what I did before?

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.120
It's different? How is it different?

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.400
I don't know either.
I didn't do this one.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:24.279
But our tax system requires
a password to log in.

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.880
Who did you give
the account password to?

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.040
I...

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.440
I didn't give it to anyone.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.600
One time, when I was doing
the taxes, Mr. Lin came by.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.600
But isn't he in charge of sales?

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.120
He wouldn't know about this.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.040
Mr. Lin?

00:33:39.041 --> 00:33:40.519
I remember his resume stated...

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.120
that he minored
in Accounting in college.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.280
Where is he? Get him here.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.840
Mr. Lin is on leave today.

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.080
On leave?

00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:00.480
(Prison and detention center food)

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.400
That's enough.

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.160
Have some water first.

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:16.760
Drink some water.

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:21.240
Tell me.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:23.200
If he's really convicted,

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.200
will he have to stay in there
for three to five years?

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.560
How can he endure that?

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.359
Cheng Yu.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:35.320
You have connections.
Help me ask around.

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:36.760
See if you can...

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.520
arrange for me to meet him.

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.800
You two are partners in the company.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:45.680
So for now,

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.120
you can't meet.

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.880
This is too fishy.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.400
Don't worry.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.520
I've already sent someone
to investigate this.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.920
I've also hired a lawyer...

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000
for Chi Cheng.

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.520
So don't worry.

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:08.640
Do you think...

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:10.840
he's eating well in there?

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.440
Is he sleeping well in there?

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.240
Don't worry about it.

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:16.520
- Don't worry.
- Don't worry.

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:24.240
(Prison Cell)

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.440
1706.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.360
Come on.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.880
Get up and eat.

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.519
Humans need food.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:42.680
You have to eat.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.440
Tomorrow, the lawyer
you hired is coming.

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.120
Get up.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.080
The food is good today.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:52.880
Here.

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.520
How is it? Any news?

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:15.880
We got it.

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:20.000
They say the mastermind
is someone named Wang Zhen Long.

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:21.840
Do you know him?

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.280
(Bonus Clip)

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.640
I'm scared.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.240
Don't be scared. I'm here.

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:39.720
I'm with you.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.280
It'll get better later. Just watch.

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:48.040
- What's wrong?
- Just now, a ghost touched me.

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.520
There's no ghost.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:50.760
I'm here. I can protect you.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:52.976
It's really nice towards the end.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.160
Trust me. Watch it.

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.160
Da Wei!

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.120
What are you doing?

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.359
I didn't want...

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.000
to interrupt you two.
