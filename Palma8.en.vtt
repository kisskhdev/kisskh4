00:00.250 --> 00:03.086
Previously on
Seducing Drake Palma.

00:03.628 --> 00:04.628
But I met someone.

00:04.655 --> 00:05.655
You’re not even good-looking.

00:06.214 --> 00:07.340
I don’t want to be handsome,

00:08.883 --> 00:09.968
I just want to be loved.

00:12.262 --> 00:13.263
By you, perhaps.

00:17.434 --> 00:18.984
I know you’d like her, Mom.

00:19.436 --> 00:21.413
Alys is right there,
she’s your girlfriend!

00:21.438 --> 00:22.835
I know, but I want you!

00:24.858 --> 00:27.027
I said can we break up already?

00:28.236 --> 00:29.236
Why?

00:29.855 --> 00:31.565
Because you don’t even like me.

00:33.085 --> 00:34.503
I don’t like you either.

00:36.569 --> 00:37.971
I don’t want to.

00:37.996 --> 00:39.695
You’re horrible!

00:40.248 --> 00:42.375
Why won’t you let me go?!

00:43.251 --> 00:45.295
You like Aunt Katrina, don’t you?

00:46.588 --> 00:47.797
Katrina’s pregnant.

00:50.508 --> 00:52.052
Alys, what if I’m the father?

00:54.662 --> 00:56.039
What would you do?

01:28.129 --> 01:29.129
Drake…

01:30.715 --> 01:31.800
are you serious?

01:43.895 --> 01:45.021
Come on, Drake.

01:46.815 --> 01:49.150
I said I like you,

01:50.401 --> 01:53.363
I didn’t say you should
make me look like a fool, right?

01:56.449 --> 01:58.409
Why are you like this?

02:04.541 --> 02:06.126
Does Uncle Steve know?

02:09.295 --> 02:11.422
Drake, I feel bad for your Dad.

02:15.176 --> 02:16.176
How about you?

02:17.663 --> 02:19.164
How about what you feel?

02:25.436 --> 02:26.896
I still like you?

02:28.064 --> 02:29.691
What do you think
my feelings are—

02:30.733 --> 02:33.444
a toilet you can
just flush down?

02:42.662 --> 02:43.662
Alys!

02:48.042 --> 02:49.752
I’m kidding! I’m not the dad.

02:51.337 --> 02:54.172
What the heck! You
joke around too much!

03:11.691 --> 03:13.943
But, seriously...

03:15.403 --> 03:16.796
Aunt Katrina’s really pregnant?

03:17.572 --> 03:18.572
Mmm.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.534
You’re gonna have a sibling!

03:25.243 --> 03:27.186
What’s so great
about having a sibling?

03:27.790 --> 03:29.042
I’m fine by my own.

03:30.210 --> 03:33.671
You know siblings will never
leave you, no matter what.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.550
Sometimes, even
when you’re wrong,

03:37.592 --> 03:38.760
they’ll still take your side.

03:43.097 --> 03:46.639
That’s what’s nice
about having a sibling.

03:52.315 --> 03:54.817
I don’t like it when
you speak profoundly.

03:57.028 --> 03:57.612
Ugh, annoying!

03:57.612 --> 04:00.365
I like you weird and shallow.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.078
You like me weird and shallow?

04:06.579 --> 04:08.456
So, does that mean you like me?

04:13.253 --> 04:14.253
Annoying!

04:16.256 --> 04:17.632
We’ll get there soon, Alys.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.835
He mentioned my name again.

05:14.147 --> 05:17.734
I love you, Drake Palma!

05:21.321 --> 05:23.448
Miss Alys, Sir Steve is here.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.116
Sir Steve?

05:25.199 --> 05:26.743
Drake’s dad.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.037
Ah, okay! Thank you!

05:34.709 --> 05:35.709
Uncle Steve!

05:37.211 --> 05:38.212
Hi!

05:39.756 --> 05:42.550
Are you here to give me your gift?

05:48.564 --> 05:49.564
Alys.

05:49.932 --> 05:50.932
Hmm?

05:52.894 --> 05:54.228
Break up with Drake.

05:56.147 --> 05:57.147
Huh?

05:57.472 --> 05:58.472
What?

05:59.391 --> 06:02.683
Drake and I are just
getting started, and now this?

06:03.279 --> 06:05.761
We’re not even at the climax
yet, and it’s already over?

06:06.616 --> 06:08.117
Uncle, is this a joke?

06:09.035 --> 06:10.286
What’s the reason?

06:11.704 --> 06:13.539
Why is Uncle Steve mad?

06:14.832 --> 06:16.334
Aunt Katrina’s pregnant,

06:16.334 --> 06:18.042
shouldn’t he be happy now?

06:18.669 --> 06:19.669
Besides,

06:20.046 --> 06:22.620
he doesn’t even know about
Drake and Aunt Katrina, right?

06:25.843 --> 06:27.331
Or maybe he knows already?

06:28.190 --> 06:31.409
Alys just break up with
Drake, for everyone’s sake.

06:32.767 --> 06:33.767
I don’t want to.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.060
Come on, Alys!

06:35.353 --> 06:36.687
Come on, Uncle Steve.

06:37.021 --> 06:38.689
Why would I do that

06:38.689 --> 06:41.359
when you haven’t
given me a valid reason?

06:43.498 --> 06:44.604
You just won’t understand.

06:45.530 --> 06:46.597
You’re still young.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.784
Leave Drake before you get hurt.

06:51.112 --> 06:53.538
Uncle Steve, like they say,

06:54.455 --> 06:57.542
“How would you know
what’s love if there’s no pain?”

06:58.668 --> 06:59.919
That’s why...

07:03.198 --> 07:04.424
it keeps getting painful, huh?

07:04.449 --> 07:06.451
Uncle Steve, please don’t cry.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.261
Is something wrong?

07:09.595 --> 07:10.930
You just won’t understand.

07:12.056 --> 07:14.308
I’ll try to understand, promise!

07:15.226 --> 07:16.269
You’re still a kid!

07:17.728 --> 07:20.373
Uncle Steve, age is just a number!

07:20.398 --> 07:21.401
Try me!

07:21.649 --> 07:25.111
Drake even said,
I’m getting more profound now.

07:25.734 --> 07:26.818
You sure?

07:32.326 --> 07:33.573
Your Aunt Katrina’s pregnant.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.582
Yes, Drake told me.

07:38.249 --> 07:39.584
What did he tell you?

07:45.440 --> 07:47.401
Honestly, Uncle Steve...

07:48.843 --> 07:52.221
I already knew about
Aunt Katrina and Drake.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.933
So I’m the only
one left in the dark.

07:58.102 --> 07:59.562
Alright Alys, I’m leaving.

08:00.396 --> 08:01.481
Uncle Steve!

08:12.450 --> 08:13.450
Drake.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.496
Mom?

08:25.755 --> 08:27.757
Mom, please don’t leave me.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.515
No one can replace you, Mom.

08:36.307 --> 08:39.685
I’ll make sure Dad
and Katrina split up.

08:45.816 --> 08:46.943
Son...

08:47.880 --> 08:49.581
I’ve been gone a long time.

08:51.186 --> 08:52.542
Let me go.

08:55.542 --> 08:57.722
Let your dad be happy.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.039
And you too.

09:05.161 --> 09:08.414
You need to be happy—for yourself.

09:09.856 --> 09:11.597
It’s time to let go, Drake.

09:14.929 --> 09:15.929
No, Mom.

09:16.806 --> 09:17.865
No, Mom.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.075
Let me go.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.100
No.

09:20.977 --> 09:21.977
No.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.397
Mom.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.083
Mom.

09:46.210 --> 09:47.300
Mom!

09:50.131 --> 09:51.131
Mom!

09:53.009 --> 09:54.009
Let me go.

10:03.394 --> 10:04.394
Mom.

10:21.912 --> 10:24.165
Ma’am, please eat.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.710
Nanny, call Drake.

10:27.735 --> 10:28.819
Yes, Sir.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.468
Sir Steve is calling you.

10:44.018 --> 10:44.952
What?

10:45.094 --> 10:47.680
How long have you been
keeping this relationship from me?

10:47.886 --> 10:49.323
Come on, Steve!

10:49.607 --> 10:50.607
Why do you care?

10:51.663 --> 10:53.998
Drake, show some
respect. I’m your father.

10:54.862 --> 10:56.697
We’re not in a relationship, Steve.

10:57.948 --> 10:59.075
To be honest,

10:59.854 --> 11:01.897
all I feel for Drake is concern.

11:02.231 --> 11:03.858
He needs someone to talk to.

11:05.122 --> 11:07.041
Someone to lean on.

11:07.534 --> 11:08.793
That’s what I am to him.

11:09.293 --> 11:10.711
Nothing more than that.

11:11.009 --> 11:13.678
Believe me when I say you’re
the father of the baby I’m carrying.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.759
Why would I believe you?

11:16.940 --> 11:18.094
How would I even know for sure?

11:18.094 --> 11:20.137
I’m barely ever home!

11:20.581 --> 11:21.957
For all I know, something’s
going on between you two!

11:21.982 --> 11:24.109
I reserve my first time for Alys.

11:25.893 --> 11:28.062
Then why are you
only telling me now?

11:28.604 --> 11:30.439
Why wait until we’re
already fighting?

11:30.481 --> 11:32.441
Because I hate you
for replacing Mom.

11:33.901 --> 11:36.487
I tried getting Katrina
to break you up –

11:37.029 --> 11:38.823
for mom, for me.

11:38.916 --> 11:40.626
I’m very disappointed, Dad.

11:41.867 --> 11:44.537
Drake, if you’ve got a problem,

11:44.861 --> 11:46.404
get out of my house!

11:46.689 --> 11:48.464
But I’ll buy you your own condo.

11:48.916 --> 11:51.460
Uncle Steve, don’t kick Drake out.

11:52.211 --> 11:53.713
He’s still a minor!

11:54.338 --> 11:56.507
Stupid, I’m already eighteen!

11:58.050 --> 11:59.276
Still!

11:59.301 --> 12:01.379
We’re only in senior
high school, Uncle Steve!

12:01.404 --> 12:03.281
Please, don’t kick him out.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.766
This is for the best, Alys.

12:05.766 --> 12:06.784
Trust me.

12:06.809 --> 12:07.977
Best for what?

12:08.853 --> 12:11.647
He’s leaving while
you two are fighting?

12:12.148 --> 12:15.109
Uncle Steve, make love not hate.

12:15.134 --> 12:16.110
Don’t intrude!

12:16.136 --> 12:18.050
I’m still talking to your Dad!

12:19.739 --> 12:21.282
Uncle Steve, please.

12:21.699 --> 12:22.699
Steve…

12:28.164 --> 12:29.189
Come on, Alys.

12:29.214 --> 12:31.876
Uncle Steve, can’t it
wait until after graduation?

12:32.251 --> 12:33.894
It’s just two weeks away!

12:34.082 --> 12:35.584
I’ve made up my mind.

12:35.668 --> 12:36.752
I’ll call the agent.

12:37.151 --> 12:39.153
Help Drake pack up.

12:41.677 --> 12:43.679
Don’t you love Drake?

12:45.723 --> 12:47.558
I love him that’s why I’m doing this.

13:22.530 --> 13:23.656
Sorry, Steve.

13:26.696 --> 13:29.032
I should’ve told you from the start.

13:29.805 --> 13:33.225
But I was afraid I’d ruin your
relationship with your son.

13:38.884 --> 13:39.885
Katrina,

13:41.976 --> 13:43.185
do you love me...

13:43.793 --> 13:45.018
or are we just fooling around?

13:46.575 --> 13:50.412
Because I really love you.

13:51.668 --> 13:53.299
I love you, Steve.

13:55.123 --> 13:58.126
That’s why I apologized
when I messed up, right?

14:01.482 --> 14:04.360
What about Drake—do
you love him too?

14:04.564 --> 14:05.668
No.

14:05.693 --> 14:07.111
I don’t love Drake.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.765
Not romantically.

14:10.828 --> 14:12.034
I love you.

14:13.769 --> 14:16.105
You heard what he said, right?

14:16.286 --> 14:18.205
Why he did all those things.

14:20.270 --> 14:22.105
I just couldn’t tell you...

14:22.545 --> 14:24.346
how Drake was treating me,

14:24.564 --> 14:25.815
because I was scared.

14:29.422 --> 14:30.965
Scared to lose him?

14:34.068 --> 14:35.277
I’m scared...

14:35.895 --> 14:38.252
that I’d ruin your
relationship with your son.

14:41.338 --> 14:42.854
Drake is still young.

14:44.174 --> 14:45.593
He’s full of anger.

14:47.344 --> 14:50.472
The least I could do
was to be there for him.

14:50.848 --> 14:51.932
That’s all it was.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.436
We were okay, Steve.

14:57.463 --> 14:59.002
I didn’t want to cause any trouble.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.025
Especially now.

15:03.694 --> 15:04.694
Okay.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.783
I accept your explanation

15:14.538 --> 15:15.538
Thank you, Steve.

15:15.915 --> 15:16.915
Thank you.

15:20.181 --> 15:23.101
Get changed, we’re
going to the OB-GYN

15:26.383 --> 15:27.383
Thank you.

15:45.903 --> 15:47.154
Why?

15:48.030 --> 15:49.030
Sweetie!

15:50.199 --> 15:51.175
Mom?

15:51.200 --> 15:53.035
Come down here, quick!

15:53.327 --> 15:54.327
Mom.

15:55.996 --> 15:56.931
What is it?

15:56.956 --> 15:57.848
What is it?

15:57.873 --> 15:59.833
What happened? Is there a fire?

16:00.000 --> 16:01.217
- What?!
- You!

16:01.418 --> 16:02.878
Why didn’t you tell me?

16:02.920 --> 16:03.920
Tell you what?

16:04.463 --> 16:06.905
That you and son-in-law are a thing now!

16:10.010 --> 16:11.010
Hi, Bee!

16:12.388 --> 16:15.616
Alright, I’ll leave you two alone
now so you can have quality time.

16:15.641 --> 16:16.433
Go on.

16:16.458 --> 16:17.458
What the heck, Mom!

16:21.021 --> 16:22.022
Why are you here?

16:23.029 --> 16:24.572
And why did you tell Mom that?

16:25.067 --> 16:26.777
Oh, these are real flowers now.

16:28.537 --> 16:31.405
And a voodoo doll that
looks exactly like you!

16:31.740 --> 16:33.075
And chocolates!

16:36.870 --> 16:38.014
Sugar-free.

16:41.375 --> 16:42.835
Stop being so extra, Kent Justin!

16:43.043 --> 16:44.225
I’ll kick you!

16:44.336 --> 16:45.545
You’re so brutal, Bee!

16:46.422 --> 16:47.631
Why are you here?

16:48.674 --> 16:51.010
Can’t I visit my girlfriend?

16:51.468 --> 16:52.845
It feels so good saying
you’re my girlfriend!

16:53.887 --> 16:55.163
You’re so over the top!

16:55.681 --> 16:58.283
Mmm, but you love me anyway!

16:58.308 --> 17:00.352
Yuck!

17:00.377 --> 17:04.214
Admit it. You’re totally
in love with me, Bee!

17:04.273 --> 17:05.315
You’re so cringe!

17:06.640 --> 17:09.403
Oh well. What can you do, Aya?

17:09.403 --> 17:10.612
You said yes.

17:10.612 --> 17:12.031
So deal with it!

17:12.031 --> 17:13.490
- My gosh!
- Hi, Bee!

17:16.785 --> 17:17.937
Chocolates.

17:18.162 --> 17:19.033
It’s sugar-free, right?

17:19.058 --> 17:20.059
Sugar-free, promise!

17:22.472 --> 17:25.017
How to Decipher Drake Palma 101:

17:25.669 --> 17:27.629
If you ask him something
and he doesn’t answer,

17:27.629 --> 17:29.548
that means it’s okay.

17:29.715 --> 17:33.010
Because if it isn’t,
he’ll just go “Tss!”.

17:33.335 --> 17:34.361
Okay.

17:34.386 --> 17:35.386
Aja!

17:44.920 --> 17:45.920
Uhm...

17:46.341 --> 17:48.509
Your Dad said you should
start packing your stuff.

17:49.359 --> 17:50.359
Tss.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.214
What are you thinking?

18:10.839 --> 18:11.839
Huh?

18:12.049 --> 18:13.383
You have that weird face, again.

18:14.301 --> 18:15.486
Weird face?

18:15.511 --> 18:17.596
Like you’re trying to
harass me or something.

18:17.750 --> 18:18.597
Tss!

18:18.597 --> 18:21.484
You’re the one who said you’re
“reserving your first” for me!

18:23.018 --> 18:24.711
But you got butterflies, didn’t you?

18:25.229 --> 18:26.080
Huh?

18:26.105 --> 18:27.272
How did he know?

18:30.234 --> 18:31.443
Whatever, Palma!

18:34.196 --> 18:38.075
He barely talks, Lord.
But when he does...

18:38.100 --> 18:41.495
my heart can’t handle it.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.121
Pack my things.

18:48.313 --> 18:50.441
This guy has no shame!

18:52.599 --> 18:53.835
Do I look like your maid?

18:54.550 --> 18:55.526
No.

18:55.551 --> 18:58.500
But you like me and
I’ll use that as my advantage.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.070
Wow!

19:03.183 --> 19:03.951
Tss.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.429
Fine, I enjoy packing anyway.

19:06.582 --> 19:07.992
I’m an expert.

19:12.943 --> 19:14.528
Suitcase number one:

19:15.231 --> 19:17.156
Uniform and school stuff.

19:20.105 --> 19:22.816
Suitcase number two: your clothes.

19:23.245 --> 19:25.497
Wow, everything’s for showing off.

19:25.497 --> 19:26.890
You’re such a model.

19:26.915 --> 19:28.792
And then, last but not least...

19:29.257 --> 19:30.769
Suitcase number three:

19:30.794 --> 19:32.963
all your grooming essentials.

19:34.298 --> 19:35.298
Aja!

19:38.427 --> 19:42.139
I feel like Drake’s housewife,
picking out his outfits.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.604
What am I forgetting?

19:49.479 --> 19:51.690
Shorts? T-shirt?

19:52.900 --> 19:54.209
Shocks!

19:54.234 --> 19:55.234
Underwear?!

20:08.790 --> 20:09.790
Tss.

20:13.086 --> 20:14.129
You’ve got the wrong idea!

20:17.466 --> 20:18.954
Do you even know
what I’m thinking?

20:21.511 --> 20:24.030
My heart, get ready.

20:24.598 --> 20:30.729
Here comes another pick-up line
that’ll keep me up all night!

20:31.438 --> 20:33.106
And why are you
holding my underwear?

20:34.131 --> 20:35.469
I didn’t mean to!

20:35.984 --> 20:37.500
My hand just landed on it!

20:39.321 --> 20:40.322
Accidentally?

20:46.954 --> 20:48.000
You’re a perv!

20:48.580 --> 20:50.165
Hey, that’s harsh! I’m not!

20:53.252 --> 20:55.055
You just want to see my abs.

20:55.671 --> 20:56.671
You’re the worst!

21:01.845 --> 21:03.138
Satisfied?

21:19.403 --> 21:20.946
Bee, come on.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.698
It’s just a simple math problem.

21:24.449 --> 21:27.171
What’s “simple”
about math problems?

21:27.196 --> 21:28.537
My brain hurts!

21:28.578 --> 21:30.289
Bee, think about it.

21:30.914 --> 21:32.758
The entrance exam’s next week.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.352
Of course, I want us both in SCA.

21:37.587 --> 21:38.880
As if you’ll pass!

21:39.631 --> 21:40.924
Of course, I’m smart!

21:42.592 --> 21:43.592
What about you?

21:44.636 --> 21:47.180
Are you saying I’m dumb?

21:47.837 --> 21:49.658
Even if you were...

21:49.683 --> 21:51.485
I’d still love you to bits.

21:55.647 --> 21:56.898
Gross!

21:58.191 --> 21:59.813
Come on, let’s study again.

22:00.569 --> 22:01.538
Game!

22:01.563 --> 22:03.780
I don’t want to anymore!

22:03.780 --> 22:05.574
My brain can’t take it, Kent!

22:05.615 --> 22:07.743
Bee, don’t say you can’t.

22:07.768 --> 22:09.407
Say “I got this!”

22:09.432 --> 22:11.346
I really can’t!

22:11.371 --> 22:12.956
You’re so pushy!

22:13.206 --> 22:15.417
I’ll never pass!

22:15.459 --> 22:17.085
I’ll just go to Brenford.

22:17.085 --> 22:18.312
Brenford?

22:18.337 --> 22:20.839
So, what’s gonna happen?
You’ll leave me all alone at SCA?

22:21.798 --> 22:23.633
Hmm? Huh?

22:23.800 --> 22:25.177
You’re way too clingy.

22:25.844 --> 22:27.469
Hey, FYI...

22:28.847 --> 22:30.932
our subdivisions are
right next to each other.

22:31.193 --> 22:32.524
Yeah, but...

22:33.393 --> 22:35.145
it’s different if we’re
in the same school.

22:35.979 --> 22:36.979
I’ll miss you.

22:38.505 --> 22:39.505
Tss.

22:39.649 --> 22:40.961
That’s why we’re doing this.

22:41.234 --> 22:42.694
We’re always together, right?

22:43.737 --> 22:45.489
What if you don’t pass SCA?

22:46.810 --> 22:48.353
Should I just go to Brenford too?

22:49.409 --> 22:50.727
You’re so dramatic!

22:51.495 --> 22:52.704
Just go to SCA!

22:53.016 --> 22:54.498
Don’t waste your brain.

22:54.956 --> 22:55.956
Besides,

22:56.208 --> 23:00.024
isn’t it obvious that you’re
welcome here in our house?

23:00.962 --> 23:02.881
My Mom basically worships you.

23:04.257 --> 23:05.567
So study!

23:05.592 --> 23:06.718
You got this, Bee!

23:06.718 --> 23:08.695
This one’s easy, promise!

23:08.720 --> 23:09.846
Focus!

23:09.846 --> 23:11.681
I’m right here to help.

23:11.706 --> 23:13.977
- I’m done!
- No, read! There!

23:25.779 --> 23:27.948
Drake, just curious...

23:30.283 --> 23:33.328
you said you want me to be
more honest with you, right?

23:35.914 --> 23:36.431
Tss.

23:36.456 --> 23:39.543
Is it really true nothing’s going
on with you and Aunt Katrina?

23:43.839 --> 23:45.090
Because...

23:45.715 --> 23:48.218
you brought her cake before, right?

23:48.260 --> 23:50.303
I saw you kiss her.

23:51.972 --> 23:54.015
Then Aya also saw—

23:54.057 --> 23:56.143
You really are my
stalker, aren’t you?

24:01.440 --> 24:02.440
Did you see us kiss?

24:05.652 --> 24:07.946
That’s because she
always avoids my attempts.

24:14.369 --> 24:15.704
Aki, what are you doing?!

24:19.541 --> 24:20.584
In fairness to her.

24:21.710 --> 24:22.919
I guess...

24:23.587 --> 24:25.172
she really loves my Dad.

24:28.425 --> 24:29.425
Okay.

24:31.928 --> 24:32.928
We’re almost there.

24:43.064 --> 24:44.524
Also...

24:45.043 --> 24:48.379
Could you take care of the stuff?

25:10.524 --> 25:11.524
Mr. Palma?

25:12.761 --> 25:14.070
Welcome to Cove Tower!

25:14.095 --> 25:17.477
Sir Steve told me
you’d be arriving today.

25:18.016 --> 25:20.587
By the way, I’m the condo manager.

25:24.731 --> 25:27.275
Yes, this is Drake Palma.

25:27.317 --> 25:28.068
Thanks!

25:28.068 --> 25:29.736
Sorry he’s a bit grumpy.

25:30.153 --> 25:31.004
No worries.

25:31.029 --> 25:32.438
Right this way, Sir.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.352
Right this way, sir

25:57.764 --> 25:58.764
This way.

26:00.873 --> 26:03.525
Oh my, it’s so nice here.

26:03.962 --> 26:05.657
I want my own condo unit too.

26:05.779 --> 26:08.198
Sir Steve chose a
high-end two-bedroom unit.

26:08.900 --> 26:11.653
That offers both space
and comfortability.

26:12.112 --> 26:13.634
And Ma’am, please hold on.

26:15.529 --> 26:17.852
Wow, Uncle Steve moves fast!

26:18.159 --> 26:20.912
We just packed and he
already sent your helper...

26:20.912 --> 26:22.706
the address and the passcode.

26:23.957 --> 26:28.086
But this is farther from my house than his.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.589
We’ll be in a long‑distance relationship.

26:32.507 --> 26:35.446
Sir, do you want to
change your passcode?

26:36.636 --> 26:39.639
Uhm Drake, they said
change your passcode.

26:39.639 --> 26:41.016
1131.

26:41.808 --> 26:44.060
1131. Okay thank you, Sir.

26:44.144 --> 26:45.328
Thank you!

26:45.353 --> 26:46.353
11-what?

26:52.527 --> 26:53.527
11-31.

26:54.863 --> 26:56.531
November 31.

26:57.824 --> 26:58.824
Our monthsary.

26:59.826 --> 27:00.826
Sometimes...

27:00.827 --> 27:03.107
I don’t even know why I
ended up with a noob like you.

27:06.455 --> 27:10.029
Sometimes I don’t even care about
Drake’s harsh words anymore.

27:10.938 --> 27:12.435
That’s just how he is.

27:13.340 --> 27:15.779
Drake isn’t Drake
without the harsh words.

27:16.676 --> 27:17.888
But despite that...

27:18.628 --> 27:23.007
the moment he throws
in that classic Drake‑style flirt?

27:23.642 --> 27:24.642
Game over.

27:25.310 --> 27:28.271
Every annoyance disappears.

27:28.772 --> 27:30.387
Kids!

27:30.412 --> 27:32.747
- Have some snacks first!
- Hi, Auntie!

27:34.694 --> 27:35.737
Thanks so much!

27:36.196 --> 27:41.357
Son‑in‑law, I made
juice as sweet as you!

27:41.618 --> 27:46.247
And some sticky rice,
so you’ll stick together!

27:46.247 --> 27:47.974
- Thank you, Auntie.
- Mom, come on!

27:47.999 --> 27:49.851
My head hurts tutoring her.

27:49.876 --> 27:51.019
She’s hopeless.

27:51.044 --> 27:54.130
Oh, son‑in‑law,
be patient with Aya.

27:54.172 --> 27:57.786
When I was pregnant with
her, I almost miscarried.

27:58.259 --> 27:59.982
Maybe it affected her brain!

28:00.013 --> 28:02.347
So please be patient, okay?

28:02.347 --> 28:04.683
Of course, future mom‑in‑law.

28:05.279 --> 28:07.781
Well, look at you
dropping “mom‑in‑law”.

28:08.144 --> 28:09.380
Improving!

28:09.646 --> 28:11.272
Obviously we’re
headed there, Bee!

28:11.564 --> 28:12.624
Hmm?

28:12.649 --> 28:14.609
As if I’d follow you to church!

28:14.640 --> 28:16.396
Then city hall it is!

28:17.098 --> 28:18.713
You’re so pushy, huh?

28:18.738 --> 28:20.013
Of course—I love you, Bee!

28:21.324 --> 28:23.368
You two are so sweet!

28:23.393 --> 28:25.687
Aya, I miss your Dad even more!

28:25.954 --> 28:26.974
Whatever, you guys.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.558
Okay, I’ll leave you two for now.

28:30.583 --> 28:32.544
- Thank you, Mommy-in-law!
- Hit the books, you two.

28:32.585 --> 28:33.585
Copy that!

28:34.838 --> 28:35.838
Got you!

28:35.974 --> 28:36.974
So, let’s eat?

28:37.233 --> 28:39.013
Will I even pass SCA?

28:39.636 --> 28:40.694
What if I don’t?

28:40.719 --> 28:41.719
Bee?

28:42.387 --> 28:43.405
Then you don’t!

28:43.430 --> 28:45.265
If it’s not meant to be, don’t force it.

28:46.589 --> 28:47.589
Bee!

28:48.444 --> 28:50.112
You look silly smiling alone.

28:53.815 --> 28:54.815
KL.

28:54.872 --> 28:55.872
Mmm?

28:56.901 --> 28:59.446
If you’re at SCA
and I’m at Brenford…

28:59.654 --> 29:00.547
Mm-hmm?

29:00.572 --> 29:02.449
Can I find an MU
partner over there?

29:03.158 --> 29:05.826
And you’re actually
asking me first?

29:07.829 --> 29:09.956
Well, you might
think I’m cheating.

29:14.210 --> 29:15.341
Don’t be like that, Aya.

29:18.482 --> 29:20.404
He just called me
“Aya” for the first time.

29:21.186 --> 29:22.701
He must be serious.

29:23.678 --> 29:25.555
He always calls me “Bee.”

29:26.848 --> 29:28.183
You know, all my exes...

29:28.933 --> 29:30.226
cheated on me.

29:31.478 --> 29:32.812
Please don’t join the club.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.888
You’re the one I’m
dead serious about,

29:37.442 --> 29:39.819
and you’d be the
worst heart‑breaker?

29:40.528 --> 29:42.447
Don’t be like that, Aya.

29:43.907 --> 29:44.907
Let’s take a break.

29:53.875 --> 29:55.193
Here, open up.

29:58.046 --> 30:00.632
Open… up!

30:00.632 --> 30:03.676
I know you’re hungry.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.380
Very good, Babe.

30:26.616 --> 30:29.035
It’s the weekend, what are you doing?

30:29.953 --> 30:31.037
It’s boring at home.

30:31.037 --> 30:32.497
So I decided to study instead.

30:33.790 --> 30:35.083
Come, stay here.

30:35.333 --> 30:37.169
Aren’t you taking the SCA exam?

30:45.134 --> 30:48.054
What for? I’m leaving anyway.

30:51.099 --> 30:53.427
It feels so good having
him beside me again.

30:54.185 --> 30:57.647
I don’t even know what I was
thinking when I broke up with him.

30:58.189 --> 30:59.190
He’s so kind,

31:00.024 --> 31:01.024
affectionate,

31:01.538 --> 31:03.466
and he really took care of me.

31:04.445 --> 31:05.530
But still, just try!

31:06.092 --> 31:07.240
It would be a waste if you don’t!

31:08.575 --> 31:10.076
Would you mind being my tutor?

31:10.785 --> 31:11.785
Sure.

31:12.036 --> 31:13.162
As long as you know how to listen.

31:13.162 --> 31:14.162
Will you listen?

31:15.099 --> 31:16.099
Yes, I will.

31:20.495 --> 31:21.830
Are you really leaving, Kei?

31:22.714 --> 31:24.107
Everything’s already planned.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.802
I’m leaving after graduation.

31:29.095 --> 31:30.179
Two weeks.

31:33.182 --> 31:34.559
In two weeks, you're leaving.

31:36.019 --> 31:37.812
And in two weeks,
we're graduating.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.566
So much will happen in two weeks.

31:42.775 --> 31:46.661
That’s why we need to make
the most of the time we have left.

31:49.866 --> 31:52.160
Do we really have to
break up in two weeks?

31:53.786 --> 31:55.413
I’m going somewhere far, Sheen.

31:57.457 --> 31:59.083
I don’t want to
be unfair to you.

32:01.753 --> 32:02.712
There you go again,

32:02.712 --> 32:04.632
making all the
decisions yourself!

32:05.965 --> 32:07.796
You really think
that’s unfair to me?

32:10.011 --> 32:11.596
Hundreds of miles away...

32:13.181 --> 32:14.181
that’s how far it is!

32:16.017 --> 32:17.101
Hundreds of miles...

32:18.102 --> 32:19.771
but my heart will
always be beside you.

32:20.570 --> 32:21.570
Sounds fair?

32:31.783 --> 32:32.783
You know,

32:34.243 --> 32:35.620
I really love you!

32:49.384 --> 32:50.151
Breakfast, Sir.

32:50.176 --> 32:52.053
Thank you so much, Karen!

33:05.525 --> 33:06.992
Why aren’t you studying?

33:10.279 --> 33:11.279
Hey.

33:12.015 --> 33:12.882
Dad.

33:12.907 --> 33:14.101
Why aren’t you studying?

33:15.451 --> 33:17.468
You’re prioritizing
photography again!

33:17.912 --> 33:19.296
That won’t be able to feed you.

33:21.082 --> 33:22.709
Your SCA exam is tomorrow.

33:23.251 --> 33:24.627
You need to get in!

33:25.753 --> 33:27.531
But I don’t want Business Ad, Dad.

33:29.340 --> 33:31.476
Then who’s supposed
to inherit our business?

33:31.884 --> 33:33.351
You’re the only
one I’m counting on.

33:34.929 --> 33:36.055
So now it’s my fault?

33:37.974 --> 33:39.767
You’re always so hard-headed.

33:42.478 --> 33:43.938
Why can’t you be
more like Drake?

33:46.524 --> 33:48.403
Okay fine, I’ll study.

33:49.505 --> 33:53.239
Just so I can live up to even a fraction
of the Palma family’s golden boy.

33:56.409 --> 33:58.224
Why don’t you make
Drake your son instead?

33:58.786 --> 34:00.496
At least he’s not a
disappointment, right?

34:27.440 --> 34:28.440
What now?

34:28.941 --> 34:30.651
What are you staring at?

34:31.277 --> 34:32.277
Open the door.

34:33.196 --> 34:34.922
Why me? You live there.

34:34.947 --> 34:35.947
You do it!

34:36.074 --> 34:37.336
You know the passcode.

34:49.003 --> 34:50.963
I have short-term memory loss.

34:50.963 --> 34:52.590
I forgot it already.

35:02.100 --> 35:06.521
Stand there until you remember.

35:06.979 --> 35:07.979
What?

35:10.733 --> 35:11.733
Drake!

35:12.193 --> 35:13.193
Drake!

35:14.904 --> 35:15.905
Hey!

35:17.240 --> 35:18.658
Drake!

35:21.369 --> 35:23.179
That weirdo can totally hear me.

35:23.204 --> 35:24.766
He’s just pretending not to.

35:29.210 --> 35:30.353
Drake!

35:30.378 --> 35:31.378
Hey!

35:34.023 --> 35:34.816
Oh no!

35:34.841 --> 35:36.300
Come on, Drake!

35:41.264 --> 35:42.598
I know that weirdo can hear me.

35:42.598 --> 35:44.100
he’s just ignoring me!

35:49.564 --> 35:50.648
Wait.

35:51.649 --> 35:52.649
Okay.

35:52.750 --> 35:54.277
1121.

35:56.529 --> 35:58.197
1124?

36:09.167 --> 36:10.793
1120.

36:11.502 --> 36:12.645
Ugh!

36:12.670 --> 36:14.172
You’re so annoying!

36:16.090 --> 36:17.090
Drake!

36:17.967 --> 36:19.093
Drake!

36:20.136 --> 36:21.136
Tss.

36:21.320 --> 36:22.321
My noob girlfriend!

36:23.181 --> 36:24.181
Hello?!

36:24.640 --> 36:26.961
I know you can hear
me and see me, Drake!

36:30.445 --> 36:31.445
Did she really forget?

36:33.566 --> 36:35.818
How could she forget
such an important date?

36:38.529 --> 36:40.406
Who could possibly remember—

36:41.949 --> 36:42.949
Sheen!

36:50.625 --> 36:51.625
Alys?

36:53.044 --> 36:54.044
Hello?

36:54.295 --> 36:55.295
Sheen!

36:56.382 --> 36:57.965
Alys, why’d you call?

36:58.090 --> 36:59.759
When is Drake and I’s monthsary again?

37:00.760 --> 37:01.928
Isn’t it November 31?

37:02.720 --> 37:04.096
But Alys, isn’t it—

37:04.121 --> 37:04.906
That’s right!

37:04.931 --> 37:05.640
November 31.

37:05.681 --> 37:06.724
Thank you so much,
thank you, thank you!

37:06.766 --> 37:08.687
There’s no November 31, Alys.

37:08.976 --> 37:10.161
What are you saying, of course there is!

37:10.186 --> 37:11.186
Bye.

37:13.272 --> 37:14.272
Okay.

37:15.983 --> 37:18.110
1131.

37:20.196 --> 37:21.196
Yes!

37:22.373 --> 37:23.758
Better save that in my notes!

37:23.783 --> 37:26.851
Drake might go into
his weirdo mode again...

37:26.899 --> 37:29.360
and leave me stranded
outside his condo!

37:41.592 --> 37:42.592
You jerk!

37:43.928 --> 37:45.888
It’s not my fault
you’re such a noob.

37:46.514 --> 37:48.521
You keep calling me a noob, huh!

37:56.440 --> 37:58.615
Rolling your eyes
like that, so dramatic!

38:00.910 --> 38:01.910
What’s so funny?

38:04.448 --> 38:05.448
You.

38:05.616 --> 38:06.762
You’re so mean!

38:07.285 --> 38:08.369
You’re on a roll!

38:09.161 --> 38:10.161
I know.

38:12.373 --> 38:14.184
You’re so harsh with your words, Drake!

38:16.669 --> 38:17.753
Can you tone it down a bit?

38:21.048 --> 38:23.051
I’m okay with it,

38:23.301 --> 38:26.207
but other people might
think you’re a terrible person.

38:28.347 --> 38:30.349
Can you just tone it down, Drake?

38:30.401 --> 38:31.401
Just a little.

38:32.893 --> 38:34.437
They won’t hear my harsh words...

38:34.812 --> 38:35.980
because I won’t talk to them.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.024
Why don’t you even talk
to them in the first place?

38:38.065 --> 38:39.483
Why are you such an introvert?

38:39.483 --> 38:41.126
Because they can’t
catch my attention.

38:41.652 --> 38:43.237
Because you are so picky!

38:47.158 --> 38:48.659
You’re the only person I talk to,

38:49.410 --> 38:50.868
in case you haven’t noticed,

38:51.120 --> 38:52.439
because you’re such a noob.

38:55.041 --> 38:56.041
What the heck.

38:56.440 --> 38:59.985
I’m getting butterflies even if
what he’s saying isn’t sweet at all.

39:01.047 --> 39:04.133
So that means...

39:04.842 --> 39:07.345
I got your attention?

39:11.449 --> 39:12.892
Calm down, heart.

39:13.441 --> 39:15.877
Don’t palpitate too much.

39:18.189 --> 39:19.940
Catch is an understatement.

39:22.276 --> 39:23.276
You got me whipped,

39:24.862 --> 39:27.656
and smitten hard.

39:41.879 --> 39:45.257
I didn’t realize we finished
sorting out your stuff at 7:00 PM.

39:45.674 --> 39:47.510
Mom will be mad.

39:48.302 --> 39:49.720
Oh, he’s here.

39:50.361 --> 39:51.728
Bye, Drake! I’m heading out!

39:57.228 --> 39:58.228
Bye!

40:01.431 --> 40:02.775
Good evening, Sir.

40:13.536 --> 40:14.703
If something happens to her,

40:15.371 --> 40:16.914
I’ll chase you to hell’s end.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.369
Ma’am, your boyfriend is so sweet.

40:28.692 --> 40:30.027
Bye.

41:08.507 --> 41:11.677
I know this! Kent taught me this!

41:12.094 --> 41:13.512
I just need to remember.

41:14.513 --> 41:15.646
Is this in the book?!

41:17.266 --> 41:19.537
What’s the answer?
This is so hard!

41:21.145 --> 41:22.438
Aja! I can do this!

41:23.063 --> 41:24.154
I’m good at guessing!

41:24.773 --> 41:27.610
I need to pass!

41:32.239 --> 41:33.616
So, what do we do now?

41:35.159 --> 41:36.159
Huh?

41:37.453 --> 41:38.453
Hon, relax.

41:41.248 --> 41:42.248
Mom?

41:47.447 --> 41:48.355
Aya, sweetheart!

41:48.380 --> 41:51.342
Come down here,
son-in-law is here!

41:54.553 --> 41:55.553
Bee!

41:55.888 --> 41:57.072
Thank you!

41:57.097 --> 41:59.259
Of course,
mommy-in-law, anytime!

42:02.311 --> 42:03.311
Bee!

42:03.997 --> 42:04.997
What’s that?

42:05.022 --> 42:06.384
My admission letter from SCA!

42:06.732 --> 42:07.732
Where’s yours?

42:08.692 --> 42:10.402
Oh, I don’t have one.

42:10.402 --> 42:11.587
I didn’t get one.

42:11.612 --> 42:12.612
What?

42:12.637 --> 42:14.572
But today’s the distribution of letters.

42:15.324 --> 42:16.324
Maybe it’s just late.

42:17.326 --> 42:18.595
I really didn’t get one, Kent!

42:19.328 --> 42:20.663
What if I didn’t pass?

42:22.456 --> 42:23.456
Mom.

42:24.833 --> 42:26.585
So what do you want
to happen now, Alys?

42:28.303 --> 42:29.303
What?

42:31.298 --> 42:32.800
Hon, I’ll handle this.

42:33.926 --> 42:35.052
You deal with her.

42:35.761 --> 42:36.761
Nanny!

42:39.098 --> 42:40.098
Dad.

42:42.614 --> 42:43.621
What’s this?

42:44.353 --> 42:47.439
Notification letter from
Saint Collete Academy.

42:48.941 --> 42:50.025
You didn’t pass.

42:52.319 --> 42:53.487
I know, Dad.

42:54.280 --> 42:56.740
I barely answered
anything on the exam.

42:58.951 --> 43:00.504
What are we going to do now?

43:01.036 --> 43:03.871
I don’t even know how to
convince your mom last night.

43:04.206 --> 43:05.957
She’s about to book your ticket.

43:07.473 --> 43:09.176
You’re really sending
me to Nana’s?

43:14.592 --> 43:16.051
Come on, Alys.

43:16.421 --> 43:17.426
Look...

43:17.886 --> 43:21.432
We let you go to a regular school even when
we knew your grades weren’t doing well,

43:22.099 --> 43:24.598
because you said
that’s what you wanted.

43:25.936 --> 43:28.027
You actually did better when
you were homeschooled!

43:29.315 --> 43:31.715
We just wanted you to improve,

43:32.651 --> 43:34.535
but you really tested
your Mom’s patience.

43:35.279 --> 43:38.824
Dad, please don’t
send me to the States.

43:40.409 --> 43:42.202
Okay, here’s the plan...

43:43.120 --> 43:44.348
scare your mom.

43:44.830 --> 43:46.123
Tell her you’ll run away.

43:46.665 --> 43:48.418
Say you’ll take me
and Dane to the States,

43:48.649 --> 43:50.311
and she’ll be left behind.

43:50.336 --> 43:52.004
- Go ahead, tell her that.
- Seriously, Dad?

43:52.004 --> 43:53.147
Yup, she’ll agree.

43:53.172 --> 43:54.840
Thank you, Dad! You’re the best!

43:57.009 --> 43:58.009
So what now, Bee?

44:00.095 --> 44:01.555
I’m not ready for a
long-distance relationship!

44:02.806 --> 44:04.074
That’s so dramatic.

44:04.099 --> 44:07.004
SCA and Brenford are
basically next-door neighbors.

44:07.102 --> 44:08.527
What if I strangle you instead?

44:08.552 --> 44:11.301
Of course I want us to be
in the same school, Bee!

44:14.234 --> 44:15.683
So what do we do?

44:16.445 --> 44:20.282
Let’s test how much
this cockroach loves me.

44:20.282 --> 44:22.326
Then just go to Brenford too.

44:26.622 --> 44:27.622
Yeah!

44:27.998 --> 44:29.208
I’m really thinking about it

44:31.207 --> 44:31.935
Seriously?

44:31.960 --> 44:33.337
Yeah, I’m serious!

44:35.005 --> 44:37.660
But I’m still figuring out
how to tell my parents.

44:39.134 --> 44:41.902
They might have a heart attack
when they find out I’m not going to SCA.

44:42.946 --> 44:43.946
What do we do, Bee?

44:44.431 --> 44:45.431
My God.

44:47.160 --> 44:48.644
- Uhm, Kent.
- Huh?

44:50.729 --> 44:51.729
What’s this?

45:01.323 --> 45:02.449
Once again, congratulations.

45:02.449 --> 45:04.346
We look forward to
welcoming you to campus…

45:05.703 --> 45:08.080
Bee, you passed!

45:08.296 --> 45:10.298
Oh, my God!

45:10.323 --> 45:11.350
I know.

45:11.375 --> 45:12.584
I was just messing
with you earlier.

45:13.428 --> 45:15.104
That’s so mean, Bee!

45:15.129 --> 45:17.047
You played with my feelings?!

45:17.464 --> 45:19.229
You’re just too gullible.

45:19.675 --> 45:20.693
“Gullible?”

45:20.718 --> 45:21.510
I’m gullible?

45:21.552 --> 45:22.886
- No way!
- I’m gullible?!

45:22.911 --> 45:24.071
I’m gullible?!

45:24.096 --> 45:25.764
- Stop it already!
- Nope! You’re chasing me now!

45:26.324 --> 45:27.674
I’m going to hug you!

45:35.563 --> 45:36.563
Bee...

45:38.485 --> 45:39.485
can I hug you?

45:40.863 --> 45:42.338
Why are you even asking?

45:43.490 --> 45:44.979
I thought you might push me away.

45:45.659 --> 45:47.553
You’ve got violent tendencies.

45:47.578 --> 45:48.578
You’re insane!

45:48.871 --> 45:50.408
If you’re going to
hug me, just do it—

45:50.706 --> 45:51.682
Thank you, Bee!

45:51.707 --> 45:53.073
I’m so proud of you!

45:54.793 --> 45:55.793
You know what,

45:56.128 --> 45:57.838
thank God we’re not doing LDR.

45:58.547 --> 46:01.925
Because I cannot live a
day without you by my side.

46:02.926 --> 46:03.736
Whatever.

46:03.761 --> 46:06.221
One more cheesy line and I
swear I’m breaking up with you!

46:07.347 --> 46:08.347
Come on, Bee.

46:15.063 --> 46:16.063
Kent!

46:18.066 --> 46:19.752
Nanny, where’s the kosher salt?

46:20.068 --> 46:21.424
You forgot again?!

46:22.154 --> 46:25.073
Ugh Nanny, I told you
not to forget it.

46:25.073 --> 46:26.675
I need it later!

46:26.700 --> 46:27.700
Mommy?

46:28.160 --> 46:30.996
Nanny always forgets!

46:35.229 --> 46:36.250
Mommy.

46:40.380 --> 46:42.925
I’m enrolling at Brenford instead.

46:44.092 --> 46:44.902
No.

46:44.927 --> 46:47.002
I filed your
application at NYCU.

46:48.639 --> 46:50.390
Mom, seriously.

46:50.531 --> 46:52.198
Don’t “Mommy” me!

46:52.518 --> 46:54.244
I told you a million times ago,

46:54.269 --> 46:59.149
if you fail the SCA exam, we’re
shipping you off to the States!

47:01.568 --> 47:04.363
But it was really hard, Mom.

47:05.322 --> 47:07.096
Alys, it’s not hard!

47:07.121 --> 47:08.121
Aya passed!

47:09.034 --> 47:10.035
Aya passed?

47:11.495 --> 47:12.387
See?

47:12.412 --> 47:13.831
You’re the only
one who didn’t pass!

47:13.872 --> 47:15.135
You disappoint me!

47:15.165 --> 47:16.165
Nanny!

47:22.047 --> 47:23.257
I’m sorry, Mom.

47:30.681 --> 47:33.934
I really tried studying.

47:40.404 --> 47:43.210
But no matter how hard I squeezed
my brain, nothing came out.

47:43.235 --> 47:45.338
I just couldn’t do it.

47:51.743 --> 47:55.408
Please believe me. I really tried.

48:01.729 --> 48:03.397
I really did my best,

48:03.422 --> 48:06.383
but I still failed.

48:15.767 --> 48:16.852
Mommy…

48:20.355 --> 48:21.440
Mommy…

48:25.402 --> 48:26.815
I’m sorry, Alys.

48:27.529 --> 48:29.323
I have so many dreams for you.

48:30.616 --> 48:32.367
Please, don’t let us down.

48:35.704 --> 48:36.914
Sorry, Mom.

48:37.581 --> 48:38.999
Stop saying sorry.

48:39.958 --> 48:41.960
You know what, you’re
your Dad’s daughter.

48:42.753 --> 48:44.379
Your Dad is smart.

48:44.880 --> 48:47.557
Too bad he’s dumb
when it comes to love.

48:47.925 --> 48:50.302
That’s why he ended up with Liana.

48:50.928 --> 48:52.638
Mom, come on.

48:52.971 --> 48:55.974
Aunt Liana hasn’t
done anything wrong.

48:58.101 --> 48:59.101
Whatever.

49:00.145 --> 49:03.148
Just follow in your Dad’s footsteps, okay?

49:03.857 --> 49:05.776
Show us! You’re smart, sweetheart!

49:06.793 --> 49:09.838
But Mom, what would
I even do at NYCU?

49:09.863 --> 49:12.491
They don’t offer the course I want.

49:13.241 --> 49:15.535
Why? I thought you
liked Advertising?

49:17.621 --> 49:19.135
So, what do you
wanna take up, then?

49:22.584 --> 49:23.584
Baking.

49:24.461 --> 49:25.461
Please?

49:25.754 --> 49:27.022
Please, Mom.

49:27.047 --> 49:28.482
Just one semester, I promise!

49:28.507 --> 49:31.093
Just one sem at Brenford,
and if I get bad grades...

49:31.093 --> 49:34.738
you can send me straight to a
community college in the U.S.

49:34.763 --> 49:38.517
Please Mom, just
give me one chance!

49:39.309 --> 49:40.744
Okay, fine.

49:40.769 --> 49:42.479
One semester only, okay?

49:44.014 --> 49:46.141
Thank you, Mommy!

49:46.316 --> 49:47.859
Thank you, so much!

49:47.901 --> 49:49.486
Better than Liana, hmm?

49:49.486 --> 49:50.901
You’re really the best!

49:51.488 --> 49:54.908
Yes, the bestest among everyone!

49:55.534 --> 49:56.451
- That’s good.
- I love you, Mom!

49:56.476 --> 49:57.978
- I love you!
- I love you so much!

50:12.801 --> 50:13.801
Tss.

50:24.354 --> 50:25.354
What?

50:30.360 --> 50:32.587
No wonder your bill’s so high.
You bought so much stuff.

50:32.612 --> 50:33.612
Tss.

50:35.449 --> 50:36.449
Why are you here?

50:38.994 --> 50:39.994
Choose one.

50:48.962 --> 50:50.695
Your Aunt Katrina’s two months pregnant.

50:54.426 --> 50:55.426
Congrats.

50:56.039 --> 50:58.221
I’m sorry you feel that
way about me and Katrina.

51:00.432 --> 51:02.078
But your Mom’s
been gone a long time.

51:03.393 --> 51:04.393
Okay.

51:04.936 --> 51:06.188
I actually don’t care anymore.

51:07.856 --> 51:08.856
Thanks, son.

51:10.734 --> 51:11.735
Here.

51:13.505 --> 51:15.968
Your admission at St. Collete Academy.

51:17.115 --> 51:18.909
Once you start
college, your Mom’s will

51:19.493 --> 51:22.204
allows you to access
your trust fund.

51:24.831 --> 51:26.616
But Drake, once
you get the money...

51:27.501 --> 51:30.295
please don’t leave me too.

51:31.254 --> 51:32.254
You’re so soft.

51:33.590 --> 51:34.590
No really, son.

51:35.092 --> 51:36.866
I miss your grumpiness.

51:37.552 --> 51:38.552
Tss.

51:38.796 --> 51:40.756
I’m crashing at your place tonight.

51:43.433 --> 51:44.433
Why can’t I?

51:44.458 --> 51:46.163
I paid for all of this anyway.

51:46.812 --> 51:47.812
I’ll pay you back.

51:48.939 --> 51:50.190
Relax, I was kidding.

51:50.899 --> 51:53.151
What if we just sleep
side by side tonight?

51:53.652 --> 51:54.652
No.

51:54.986 --> 51:56.226
Alys will stop by later.

51:56.613 --> 51:57.613
You can’t sleep here.

51:58.115 --> 51:59.273
Alys is coming?

52:01.159 --> 52:02.476
Anyway, take care, alright?

52:02.616 --> 52:04.194
But your Uncle Andy said,

52:04.958 --> 52:07.057
look after Alys. Respect her.

52:07.082 --> 52:09.084
Don’t go starting a family just yet.

52:10.544 --> 52:11.544
She’s still young.

52:11.795 --> 52:12.843
You know Uncle Andy?

52:13.046 --> 52:14.046
Of course!

52:14.750 --> 52:16.795
I already met my future in-laws.

52:19.680 --> 52:21.452
Anyway, I’m heading out.

52:25.892 --> 52:26.960
By the way, Drake...

52:27.185 --> 52:29.496
Alys is too cute, she convinced me.

52:29.521 --> 52:30.960
She asked me to buy you a car.

52:31.398 --> 52:33.640
I had no choice, so I bought you one.

52:34.067 --> 52:35.902
It’s in the parking
lot right now, waiting.

52:37.946 --> 52:40.240
Don’t you ever look at her
when she’s being cute and all.

52:41.199 --> 52:42.742
That’s only for me to see.

52:45.287 --> 52:46.287
I’m heading out

52:59.562 --> 53:00.859
You passed too, Kei!

53:02.596 --> 53:03.889
Will you study here instead?

53:05.557 --> 53:06.557
Please.

53:08.685 --> 53:10.395
Maybe this is the end for us, Sheen.

53:12.606 --> 53:15.567
At least I got to experience
being loved and how to love.

53:17.110 --> 53:18.612
Are you really leaving?

53:20.405 --> 53:21.656
I’ll come back.

53:23.742 --> 53:26.288
Maybe in five years?

53:28.496 --> 53:29.748
I’m not sure anymore.

53:33.335 --> 53:34.890
Let’s end this now.

53:40.456 --> 53:44.253
Please don’t cry
because I’ll be leaving.

53:45.138 --> 53:47.557
Smile because I’ll be returning.

53:48.934 --> 53:49.934
Okay?

53:52.938 --> 53:54.272
You’ll come back.

53:56.566 --> 53:58.026
I’ll wait for you.

54:00.035 --> 54:01.035
I’ll come back.

54:02.212 --> 54:04.973
But if you end up
liking someone else...

54:05.909 --> 54:07.238
don’t stop yourself,

54:07.376 --> 54:09.153
just because you still
have feelings for me.

54:12.698 --> 54:16.903
Falling in love, Sheen, is
the prettiest thing in the world.

54:19.506 --> 54:20.590
Okay?

54:21.716 --> 54:23.809
You’re the only one I want, Kei!

54:33.144 --> 54:34.896
But we can’t be sure of that.

54:36.773 --> 54:39.856
You might fall for Aya or Alys,

54:40.485 --> 54:42.801
so please, don’t feel
responsible for me.

54:44.948 --> 54:45.948
Okay?

54:52.289 --> 54:53.289
Goodbye, Sheen.

55:44.632 --> 55:45.632
Drake?

55:49.471 --> 55:50.471
Where is he?

55:50.882 --> 55:51.973
Drake?

55:55.560 --> 55:56.686
Where could he be?

56:00.231 --> 56:02.025
Uh, Drake?

56:05.403 --> 56:06.403
Where is he?

56:25.840 --> 56:26.883
LDR!

56:27.759 --> 56:29.210
What the heck?!

56:29.709 --> 56:31.627
I don’t want LDR!

56:47.862 --> 56:48.862
Oh, you’re here.

56:49.864 --> 56:50.864
Obviously.

56:51.408 --> 56:52.409
Where’d you go?

56:55.370 --> 56:57.174
I took the car for a test drive.

56:58.498 --> 56:59.791
Thanks for convincing Dad.

57:04.634 --> 57:05.634
Did you fail?

57:06.089 --> 57:07.465
Wow, rude much!

57:07.924 --> 57:09.884
Can’t you just ask,
“Did you pass?”

57:11.136 --> 57:14.639
“Alys” and “Passing” can’t
be used in one sentence.

57:17.809 --> 57:18.809
That’s so mean!

57:19.602 --> 57:20.895
You’re so rude.

57:31.531 --> 57:32.531
Why are you here?

57:34.951 --> 57:36.327
Nothing.

57:36.470 --> 57:37.929
Am I not allowed
to hang out here?

57:37.954 --> 57:40.707
Yes, especially when
you’re messing up my condo.

57:41.249 --> 57:42.249
OC!

57:47.857 --> 57:48.857
Uhm...

57:50.573 --> 57:51.573
Drake…

57:52.051 --> 57:53.051
What?

57:53.136 --> 57:55.013
I’ll be enrolling at Brenford.

57:55.680 --> 57:56.680
I know.

57:57.974 --> 57:58.974
How did you know?

57:59.184 --> 58:00.607
Because you’re such a noob!

58:01.060 --> 58:03.771
Wow, just because I didn’t
pass, I’m already a noob?

58:04.147 --> 58:05.147
Why?

58:05.849 --> 58:07.833
You really are a noob, aren’t you?

58:09.944 --> 58:10.944
I know.

58:11.863 --> 58:13.411
So stop rubbing it in.

58:14.157 --> 58:16.284
It’s not fun to be called
“stupid” all the time.

58:17.368 --> 58:18.368
Okay, fine.

58:19.996 --> 58:20.996
From now on,

58:21.831 --> 58:22.831
you’ll be my noob.

58:24.918 --> 58:25.918
Your noob?

58:27.045 --> 58:28.045
You’ll be my noob.

58:29.339 --> 58:31.216
Mine and mine only.

58:32.383 --> 58:33.383
Tss!

58:33.725 --> 58:34.725
No effect.

58:34.886 --> 58:36.138
I didn’t feel butterflies at all.

58:38.932 --> 58:39.932
How about this?

58:43.019 --> 58:44.019
Alys…

58:46.898 --> 58:48.733
I’ve been dying to kiss you.

59:22.308 --> 59:23.309
Wait. What is it?

59:24.263 --> 59:25.270
Okay.

59:25.295 --> 59:26.813
1121.

59:29.649 --> 59:30.942
Did she really forget?

59:31.568 --> 59:32.944
1124?

59:37.782 --> 59:39.576
How could she forget
such an important date?

59:42.787 --> 59:44.539
1120.

59:45.123 --> 59:46.266
Hey!

59:46.291 --> 59:47.792
Ugh, this is so annoying!

59:49.752 --> 59:50.752
Drake!

59:51.220 --> 59:52.220
Hello?!

59:52.630 --> 59:54.841
I know you can hear
me and see me, Drake.

59:58.136 --> 59:59.596
Drake!

01:00:02.015 --> 01:00:03.766
Alys, come on, remember.

01:00:09.522 --> 01:00:10.522
You’ve got this, Alys!

01:00:13.249 --> 01:00:14.249
Remember.

01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:20.074
Alys, remember!

01:00:21.327 --> 01:00:23.468
1131.

01:00:36.174 --> 01:00:39.260
On the next episode of
Seducing Drake Palma.

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:41.471
Get your hands off me.

01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:45.140
This is scary, I don’t wanna go in.

01:00:46.225 --> 01:00:47.935
Lord, please let
me make a friend.

01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:49.569
Just one.

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:52.190
Even if they’re ugly, just
as long as they don’t smell.

01:00:52.523 --> 01:00:53.523
My noob!

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:56.485
What?

01:00:57.904 --> 01:00:58.904
Good luck.

01:01:03.746 --> 01:01:06.540
I really miss Aya and Sheen.

01:01:07.705 --> 01:01:08.705
Hey…

01:01:08.956 --> 01:01:10.249
do you have a partner already?

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.210
I have a boyfriend!

01:01:12.627 --> 01:01:14.629
No, I meant for the Freshman Walk.

01:01:14.629 --> 01:01:15.922
Do you already have a partner?

01:01:15.922 --> 01:01:16.981
Let’s just go together.

01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:18.944
Drake, wait for me!

01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:21.917
You didn’t text me yesterday,
I was waiting for you!

01:01:22.637 --> 01:01:23.637
I have class.

01:01:24.305 --> 01:01:25.305
Wait, Drake.

01:01:33.585 --> 01:01:34.499
What?!

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:36.651
I said be careful!

01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:41.196
Ouch!

01:01:41.823 --> 01:01:42.823
Drake!

01:01:47.161 --> 01:01:48.161
Who is that?
