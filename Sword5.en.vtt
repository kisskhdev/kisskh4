00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.030
Madam, you've lived here a long time.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.790
Have you seen any young girls
from out of town lately?

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.560
Yes, there's one.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.870
Do you know where she is now?

00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:49.044
She's at Mr. Mo's house.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.120
I think it's on the east side of town.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.822
Not sure whose house exactly.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Are you looking for her?

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.310
Right...

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.040
Is the Mo family

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.520
trying to find a match
for their daughter?

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.190
What? It's not a daughter.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.270
They have a son.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.800
Right, my mistake.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.590
It's a son.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.080
So, does their son have a girlfriend?

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.470
Are you trying to find a match
for Mr. Mo's boy?

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.390
Yes.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.670
He's a good young man.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.560
He's their

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.760
only child.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.320
Honest and sincere.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.920
Good-natured too.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.800
They are one of the wealthiest families

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.440
on this street.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.800
Really? Then he must
already have a girlfriend

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.710
since he's so kind and well-off.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.600
Do they have a daughter-in-law?

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.990
You're mistaken.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.990
There is a girl in their house.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.150
But that girl

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.160
is mute.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.080
A distant relative of theirs.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.710
Poor girl, really.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.880
A few days ago,

00:02:57.888 --> 00:02:59.440
some people came looking for trouble.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:00.560
So the Mo family

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.510
took her in out of kindness.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.910
You can go to the west end
of this street.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:05.870
That's where they live.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:06.790
Go take a look.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.120
They live on the west side
of town, right?

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.040
Yes.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.520
How much?

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.440
Thirty-six yuan.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.830
Here's 40. Keep the change.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.280
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.800
Thank you.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.310
Come again.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.960
Sure.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.310
Thanks.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.230
Take care now.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.080
So, is it settled?

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.350
It's done.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.070
Thanks.

00:03:27.488 --> 00:03:28.520
To solve the problem,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.550
I should take some money.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:32.630
Get in the car first.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.270
Pleasure doing business.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.510
Nice job on the mission.

00:03:56.622 --> 00:03:58.488
You've spent all your money,
haven't you?

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.790
What else could I do?

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.120
The mission comes first.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.133
Especially when it comes straight
from Director.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.880
Hello, Mom?

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.550
We found Little Spud's location.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.160
Really?

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.400
That's great!

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:22.750
Is the child okay?

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.670
Get to the point.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.480
But they want 200,000
before they tell us

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.880
exactly where Little Spud is.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.680
Two hundred thousand?

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.640
That much?

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:33.670
I'll talk to Mom.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.390
Mom.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.120
Lin Hao and I only have 20,000 in cash.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.950
My parents don't have any
spare money either...

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:40.870
Let me talk...

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.430
Mom.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.910
Can you think of a way
to raise the money?

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.430
Xin and I

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.000
don't have much

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.120
savings on hand.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.600
I'll raise the money.

00:04:54.288 --> 00:04:55.480
If we give them the money,

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.590
will we be able to see
the child right away?

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.510
What if they're scammers?

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:00.390
What?

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.030
Mom asked if they might be scammers.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.430
No, Mom, they're not.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.630
We have a photo.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.800
Quick, send it to Mom.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.200
I'll have Lin Hao send it to you.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.560
We've seen the picture.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.080
And we asked around town.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.680
Someone saw Little Spud.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.350
Mom, it can't be fake.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.040
I'll raise the money.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.070
I'll go ask our relatives
for a loan right now.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.990
Mom.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.270
Mom, you can't ask the relatives.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.590
They warned us over and over again.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.560
They took a big risk to tip us off.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.680
You absolutely can't tell
relatives or friends...

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.920
Mom.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.822
Too many people talking

00:05:32.822 --> 00:05:34.710
could put Little Spud in danger.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.200
Don't tell anyone.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.160
Yeah, Mom, if the police find out,

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.880
you might never see Little Spud again.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.800
Okay, I get it.

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:45.470
Don't worry, you two.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.950
I won't say a word to anyone.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.320
I'll find a way myself.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.000
You have to listen to us on this.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.350
I will.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.510
Alright, I'm hanging up now.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.280
Xin...

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:07.680
We finally found him...

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.380
(Mo's Grocery)

00:06:23.933 --> 00:06:26.080
Hello, we're from the
Linshan City Police Bureau.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:27.790
Officers,

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.150
can I help you?

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.590
We heard there was
a mute girl here recently. Is that true?

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.480
Yes.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.710
A relative stayed here for a few days.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:37.750
She has already left.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.960
A distant relative?

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.360
Yes.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.160
She already left?

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.640
Yes, she's from my wife's side
of the family.

00:06:42.688 --> 00:06:44.240
Said it's too poor up in the mountains,

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:45.950
so she wanted to find a job.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.720
But how can a mute find a job?

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.830
So she couldn't find one.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.440
My wife sent her back.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.640
Mind if we take a look inside?

00:06:52.644 --> 00:06:53.640
Not at all. Come in.

00:06:54.022 --> 00:06:55.270
What's the mute girl's name?

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.560
She's a distant relative
from my wife's side,

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.120
barely even related.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.040
Not very close.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.120
I didn't ask carefully.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.120
I honestly don't know.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:06.870
And this is?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.830
This is my son,

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:08.600
Mo Lin.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.520
Say hello to them!

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.320
Why are you being so rude?

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:13.510
Go back to your room.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.430
Stop playing.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.560
Officers,

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.488
please don't mind him.

00:07:16.511 --> 00:07:17.470
He's just spoiled.

00:07:17.822 --> 00:07:20.150
There's definitely something off
about that father and son.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.000
We need to find the mute girl.

00:07:22.111 --> 00:07:23.711
She's the key to cracking the case.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.390
I'll go ask around again.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.510
If you go now, you'll tip them off.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.160
Alright.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.466
I'll get someone to watch them.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.040
Hello, Yan Lei?

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.520
Xiaoxing.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:26.350
What are you drawing?

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.640
I was just thinking what Xiaoyu
must look like now.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.350
Maybe he looks a bit like me?

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.950
But I've changed so much
since I was little,

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.590
so he must've changed too.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.870
I want to draw him out,

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:49.280
but my mind's just a blur.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:53.310
Xiaoxing,

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.000
you know,

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.440
I think about Xiaoguang a lot too.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:59.800
By age,

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.590
he should be in middle school now.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.520
Probably grown taller.

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.280
When he was little,

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.230
he had really big eyes.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.080
Guess if his nose is like mine,

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.280
or like his mom's?

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:19.080
He probably looks like his mom.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.560
Listening to the two of you talk
just now,

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.040
it got me thinking.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.800
What does Ranran look like

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.080
now that she's grown up?

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.440
She's probably about the same height
as Yanyan.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.350
But chubbier than Yan.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:46.550
When she was little,

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.080
she loved to eat.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.230
Her cheeks were all chubby.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:58.350
She had a little mole on her nose.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:03.000
I wonder if it's still there
now that she's grown.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.950
It probably is.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.560
After all these years,

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.630

Nothing else at all.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.590
I keep thinking,

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:18.600
if one day

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.160
Xiaoyu really stood in front of me,

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.590
would I still recognize him?

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:25.430
You would.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:27.750
Definitely.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.320
Didn't Xiaosu say the other day,

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.470
that a famous professor said

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.350
that family members

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:39.440
have a kind of psychic connection?

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:41.350
I believe that.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.640
Me too.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:24.630
Ma'am,

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:26.320
your house may be a bit old,

00:11:26.377 --> 00:11:28.511
but it's about to become a new
school zone property.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.110
I heard a top school is opening
a branch nearby.

00:11:31.155 --> 00:11:32.910
You'd better think carefully
before selling.

00:11:34.066 --> 00:11:35.470
This was a company-issued apartment,

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.950
and no one is living in it anymore.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.560
We need money, so let's just sell it.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.200
Let me explain again,

00:11:42.333 --> 00:11:44.270
it's about to become
a school zone property.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.466
It'll be in high demand.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.510
If it's in demand,

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:48.270
then please help me sell it fast.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.190
The sooner, the better.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.111
How soon are you thinking?

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.030
Ideally, I'd like the money today.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:55.550
Cash, full payment.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.560
Well, in that case, the price might...

00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.200
I'm willing to take a loss.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:00.710
Can you sell it?

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.280
There are some people
who've shown interest.

00:12:04.466 --> 00:12:05.270
Give me a second.

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:06.710
I'll make a few calls right now.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.390
So, how much of a discount

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:13.310
are you asking for?

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.440
Alright, hold on.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.800
I'll ask her right now.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:24.630
I have a buyer
ready to sign immediately,

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.590
but we'll need to drop the price
by another 20,000.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:28.080
So...

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.000
Sure.

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:30.590

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.040
I feel uneasy about something.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.830
I want to talk it through with you.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.630
Here's the money. Take a look.

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:07.200
I think,

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.630
since we haven't seen the child yet,

00:14:08.733 --> 00:14:10.870
maybe we should play it safe
and give them half first.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.120
What do you think?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:13.550
Okay.

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:14.510
That's safer.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:15.430
Alright.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:17.510
Wait here a moment.

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:18.822
I'll go give him the money.

00:14:18.844 --> 00:14:19.622
Okay.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:20.750
Cai Xin and Hao

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:22.040
found Little Spud,

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:23.800
but the other side
is asking for 200,000.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:25.920
We can only see the child after paying.

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:27.670
Mrs. Lin, no,

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.910
it's a scam!

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.260
Please don't believe them.
We haven't found Little Spud yet.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.520
That's what I was thinking too.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.590
I thought the same as you.

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:37.950
That's why I called you.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.630
But I already transferred the money
to Lin Hao.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:41.550
What now?

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:42.680
Alright, that should do it.

00:14:42.688 --> 00:14:43.550

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.320
don't rush just yet.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.600
I'll call Lin Hao.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.560

I'm taking my child home.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:47.870
You think you can just barge in

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:49.080
and take the child

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.440
from them that easily?

Look, listen to me.

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:55.440
Wait till they bring the child out.

They just passed Linshan North Station.

00:19:07.133 --> 00:19:07.920
What?

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.320
Okay, got it.

Alright, I'm on my way.

00:19:13.755 --> 00:19:15.644
Turn around and head to
Linshan North Station.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:25.150
Stop right there!

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.440
Put the child down.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.360
Stay back!

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.000
One more step

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:31.920
and I'll jump!

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:33.390
Don't provoke her...

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.390
No one's taking my child away from me!

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:36.880
Listen to me.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.400
Put my child down first.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.070
This is not your child! It's my child!

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:41.310
- You're right! Stay here!
- Xiaobao!

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:42.110
Don't provoke her!

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.630
Xiaobao, come to Mommy!

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.240
If you upset her,

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.390
what if she really jumps?

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.279
(The situation is dangerous.
Onlookers are on edge.)

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.820
(Daylight child snatching and rooftop
standoff. Is she mentally unstable?)

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:54.040
Director, has Cai Xin really gone mad?

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:58.920
She hasn't.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.022
Any parent who's been through this
would act the same.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.320
One more step and I'll jump!

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:20.280
They took my child!

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.280
They're bad people!

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:22.920
Officers!

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:23.570
What's going on?

00:20:23.577 --> 00:20:24.440
She took my child!

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.030
Honey...

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:27.480
Officers!

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.550
It's them!

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:29.510
They kidnapped my child!

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:30.270
That's my child!

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:30.830
Shut up!

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:31.790
That's my child!

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:33.030
Is it really your child?

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:33.950
No!

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.311
See? See? They admitted it themselves.

00:20:36.311 --> 00:20:37.177
They're traffickers!

00:20:37.222 --> 00:20:38.270
Arrest them right now.

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:39.520
Arrest them!

00:20:39.622 --> 00:20:40.200
Calm down.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.560
They're traffickers!

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.640
Calm down.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:45.480
What are you doing?

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.600
Stay back!

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:50.320
Don't come closer!

00:20:54.844 --> 00:20:55.777
Honey!

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:00.680
Director, you're here!

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.590
They're up there.

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:02.480
Come with me.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.400
Let's go.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:08.920
Honey.

00:21:08.955 --> 00:21:10.200
Honey, be careful. Don't panic.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.150
Be careful.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.400
- What's the situation?
- Director.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.110
The woman is extremely agitated.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.190
Director...

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:18.830
My wife is extremely emotional
right now.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:19.750
Can you talk to her?

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:20.760
Okay, leave it to me.

00:21:21.133 --> 00:21:22.390
Are they the child's parents?

00:21:22.466 --> 00:21:23.510
They're not the parents...

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:24.430
Cai Xin.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.560
It's me,

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:26.710
Deng Yan.

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:28.190
Do you remember me?

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:31.230
Director Deng...

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:32.870
You're here!

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.430
Arrest them all!

00:21:34.511 --> 00:21:35.510
They're all traffickers!

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:36.350
They're all scammers!

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:38.070
Shut up! Who are you calling
a trafficker?

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:40.240
I recorded it.
They admitted it themselves.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.350
Alright, take them away.

00:21:42.555 --> 00:21:43.550
Give me back my child.

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:44.910
Why are you dragging me?

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:47.280
It's my child! Why are you dragging me?

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:49.230
Cai Xin.

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:50.830
They're gone now.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:52.666
No one's taking Little Spud
from you anymore.

00:21:52.777 --> 00:21:53.800
Trust me, okay?

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:56.190
Cai Xin.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:58.600
I'm sorry.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.520
We didn't find Little Spud in time.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.960
You found him all by yourself.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.320
You really are connected by heart.

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:10.720
It was our failure.

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:15.200
You heard Little Spud calling out
to you, didn't you?

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:16.670
Yes.

00:22:17.644 --> 00:22:18.760
He has a mole on his back?

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:19.950
Yes.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.110
I saw it.

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:22.480
It's in the exact same spot.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:23.400
Alright.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.480
Don't take another step.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.670
If you take another step,

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:27.190
Little Spud could be in danger.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.040
Think about how long it's been

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:31.830
since Little Spud saw his mom.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.160
He's really sad.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:34.790
If you take one more step

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:35.870
with him in your arms,

00:22:36.333 --> 00:22:38.244
the consequences would be unthinkable.

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:39.870
Think of the child.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.670
He must be so scared,

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.110
right?

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:44.030
Yeah.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:45.350
I can't take another step.

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:47.120
He's scared.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:47.920
Honey.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:48.790
Look.

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:49.950
Why isn't he making a sound?

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:51.070
He stopped crying.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:51.960
Why did he stop crying?

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:52.880
Is he hungry?

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:53.920
Let me see him.

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:55.270
Yeah.

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:56.720
He hasn't cried for a while.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:57.840
Let me see him.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.120
Trust me.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.040
He is your Little Spud.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.830
No one can take him away from you.

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:05.590
Cai Xin...

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:06.720
Okay, you can take a look.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.710
Just one look,
and then I'll give him back to you.

00:23:08.711 --> 00:23:09.470
Okay?

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:10.880
Let me see him.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:12.030
Little Spud.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.000
Look at him. He must have been scared.

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:16.630
What's wrong, Little Spud?

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.390
It really is Little Spud.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.800
They took him away.

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:21.240
Is he crying?

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.350
He keeps looking at his mom.

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:25.510
The baby's crying.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:26.920
The baby's crying.

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:28.470
Why is he crying?

00:23:28.555 --> 00:23:29.790
Take the child for DNA testing.

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:30.830
She took him away.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.520
She took my child away!

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:34.160
She took my child away!

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.550
Why are you dragging me?

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:36.640
Why did he stop crying?

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.488
The child's safe now.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:39.155
It's okay, Honey.

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:43.240
Officer,

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.160
we've seen the photos.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.444
It really is our child. It really is!

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:48.750
We had the child

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:49.720
take a DNA test.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.520
He's not Little Spud.

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:56.430
That's impossible.

00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:58.910
You must've made a mistake.

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:00.590
You were tricked.

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:03.310
These people used
your missing child poster

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:04.240
and platform listings

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:06.240
to learn everything about Little Spud.

00:24:06.266 --> 00:24:07.800
Then they found a similar-looking child

00:24:08.111 --> 00:24:09.480
just to scam you out of your money.

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:12.510
During that time,

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:13.960
the people who gave you tips,

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:15.560
who guided you,

00:24:15.888 --> 00:24:17.760
even strangers
you asked for directions...

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:19.430
They were all impostors.

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:23.630
We were scammed...

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.480
It was all a scam.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.600
But don't worry,

00:24:26.955 --> 00:24:29.160
the Wang brothers who scammed you
have been caught.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.150
But they've already transferred
the money to Zhao Zhilong.

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:34.430
We haven't found Zhao Zhilong yet.

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:36.670
How much money did you give them?

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.040
Two hundred thousand...

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.110
Don't worry

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:48.240
about the money for now.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.310
Our criminal investigation team

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:51.520
will speak to you shortly.

00:24:55.177 --> 00:24:57.310
- We don't mind spending money.
- Xin...

00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:59.200
I'd pay two million if I had to.

00:24:59.244 --> 00:25:00.270
We don't mind the cost.

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:01.110
Xin...

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.790
It's okay.

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:02.590
No matter the cost,

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:03.670
we'll find our child.

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:04.830
We'll get our child back.

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:07.070
Director.

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.990
Please stay calm.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:09.640
Mrs. Lin is here.

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:11.470
Mom.

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:15.310
What's going on?

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:16.760
Why did you bring me here?

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:19.000
Didn't you say the child was found?

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:20.230
Please have a seat.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.560
Where's Little Spud?

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:24.910
It's all my fault, Mom.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.030
Hao...

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:28.440
It's my fault.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.360
Xin.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.000
Say something, where's the child?

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:32.430
Where's the child?

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.120
Yanyan,

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:38.600
what happened?

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:40.830
Didn't I beg you to go find them?

00:25:41.577 --> 00:25:43.444
Why didn't you bring the child back?

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:45.040
Where's the child?

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:46.950
Mom...

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.360
Mom...

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:50.240
We were scammed.

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:52.280
That child

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.480
isn't Little Spud.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:56.750
Mom...

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:57.590
Mom...

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:59.910
This is my fault. I was too desperate.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.880
It's all my fault.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.350
I was just too anxious.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.110
Mom, I was too desperate.

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:06.030
Mom...

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:09.040
I really thought

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:11.870
we'd found Little Spud,

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.320
that our child was finally coming home,

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.190
that we could finally be reunited
as a family.

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:20.960
How could this happen?

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.480
How could this happen...

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.400
It's all my fault.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.320
Mom...

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:33.720
I ruined

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.270
our happy family.

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:36.400
I've let you all down.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.560
I've let Little Spud down.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.920
I'm the sinner in this family.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:42.870
Mom...

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.350
I'm so sorry...

00:26:59.155 --> 00:27:01.488
We've lost the lead
on Little Spud again.

00:27:03.555 --> 00:27:05.400
Even after working
in this office for so long,

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.044
I'm still not used to it.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.320
That poor family

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.190
was utterly devastated.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.044
Completely heartbroken.

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:18.910
I just want to help them somehow.

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:22.910
But now the leads are a complete mess.

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:30.680
If only

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.270
we had an integrated database.

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:34.830
It would boost our efficiency so much.

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:37.230
What's that?

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.080
Let me explain simply.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.640
It's like building a space on a server

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.160
where we can upload everything,

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.430
all the case files, data,
and info from our unit.

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:46.790
Then with a simple keyword,

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:47.960
we can instantly search

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.044
for all the clues and info we need.

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:52.720
Is that complicated?

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:54.840
It'll take some time.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.200
Can you handle it?

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.110
Of course I can.

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:01.377
I'll show you when it's done.

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.560
Director Deng,

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.600
we've confirmed it.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.430
The child isn't Yao Laosan's.

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:19.320
They adopted him through legal means.

00:28:19.622 --> 00:28:21.244
And the paperwork is all in order.

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:23.520
So that's good news, at least.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Otherwise, if the child's future
were uncertain,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
everyone would still be on edge.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.800
Alright, get some rest.

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:39.800
How can I not be worried?

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:41.630
Did you see the footage?

00:28:41.955 --> 00:28:44.066
The family's so desperate
they're ready to jump.

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:48.550
Okay.

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:50.280
Let me know the moment
you hear anything.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:18.800
Hello?

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.990
Deng Yan,

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:21.800
we just got a report at the station.

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:24.133
Mr. Yin collapsed by the roadside.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.110
How could that be?

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.720
He seemed fine when he left.

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:29.520
What happened? Is he hurt?

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.680
If you want to know if he's hurt,

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:32.800
go see him yourself.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.160
Deng Yan,

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.720
let me remind you. You just
joined Anti-abduction Office.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.080
I understand your eagerness
to prove yourself.

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:41.280
But fitting into a team

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.680
takes time.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.600
Take it step by step.

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:46.750
Show concern for your colleagues
in every way.

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:47.480
Only then

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.240
can you truly be one of the team.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.510
Didn't I say

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:51.590
go all in and do your best?

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:54.320
Chief Xiao and I will support you fully.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.510
Alright?

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:56.900
Show more care for your colleagues.

00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:58.350
Alright.

00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:59.270
I understand.

00:29:59.333 --> 00:30:00.933
Thanks for letting me know, Captain Han.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.120
Okay.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:10.500
(Yin Jiansheng)

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:24.470
Mr. Yin.

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:35.070
Hello.

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:36.070
Excuse me,

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:37.560
is Bed 38 Yin Jiansheng?

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:38.800
He doesn't seem to be there.

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:40.470
Yes, that's him.

00:30:40.511 --> 00:30:42.000
But he said he had something at home

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:43.888
and asked to go back.
He'll be back later.

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.080
Hey,

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:49.590
capture the horse.

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:51.440
Where are you going with that?

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.350
Wrong move.

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:54.190
Why'd you do that?

00:30:54.222 --> 00:30:55.688
Now he's going to capture your piece.

00:30:55.711 --> 00:30:56.760
Too late now.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:57.840
Exactly, look.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:59.080
Your piece is right here.

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:00.480
Move your piece forward.

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:02.040
I can move it.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:02.920
Move it then.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.110
Look at him, just plays and walks off.

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:06.110
Sir,

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:07.030
still playing chess?

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.000
Deng.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:08.920
What brings you here?

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:11.670
Just wanted to chat
and open up with you.

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:13.240
Sure, sure.

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:14.800
So,

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:16.800
not going too well lately?

00:31:17.111 --> 00:31:18.549
As expected of a former director,

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:19.470
sharp as ever.

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:22.190
Actually,

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.760
I just wanted to share
what's on my mind.

00:31:25.511 --> 00:31:27.480
Since starting work here
in Anti-abduction Office,

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:28.440
I've realized

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.350
it's nothing like

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:30.280
what I imagined.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:31.480
The operations

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:32.400
and the cases

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:34.520
are way more complicated than I thought.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:36.880
What's wrong?

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.800
Feeling the pressure?

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.350
The Party Committee and Chief Xiao

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:42.670
chose you as Director

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:45.240
because they value your character

00:31:45.555 --> 00:31:46.822
and leadership.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.080
I heard Jiansheng was hospitalized.

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.622
So you're short-staffed, right?

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:54.470
That's true.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.400
You're here.

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.870
What are you secretly up to?

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.240
I tried to bring you food,

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.160
but you refused.

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:08.070
Now I come,

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:10.310
and the nurse tells me
you've been doing nothing

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:11.430
but secretly making calls.

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:12.270
I didn't know

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:13.390
you had so many friends.

00:32:13.711 --> 00:32:15.155
Where were you sneaking off to?

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:17.550
I was bored,

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:18.470
so I went for a walk.

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.560
You'd better keep an eye
on your husband.

00:32:21.577 --> 00:32:23.400
Before you know it,
he's off solving a case.

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:25.800
If something happens,
who's going to be responsible for it?

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:29.160
(Him? I know.)

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.240
It's the same old story.

00:32:30.311 --> 00:32:31.955
If we're talking about Jiansheng,

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.222
he's top-notch in both
character and ability.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:38.630
They don't call him the
Walking Encyclopedia for nothing.

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:42.520
Pick up any file at random
and flip to a page,

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:44.910
and he can probably
tell you all about it.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.160
Cases, always cases.

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:48.070
That's all you care about, isn't it,

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:50.030
Yin Jiansheng,
you don't think about yourself,

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:51.600
but could you at least think about me?

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.080
Hello?

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:56.230
Okay.

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:01.190
Why are you yelling?

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:04.066
Aren't you worried people will laugh?

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:05.230
Let them laugh.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.190
Now, where are you going?

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.720
Actually...

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.560
Considering Mr. Yin's age
and experience,

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.800
after you stepped down as Director,

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:19.310
he really should've taken over the role,

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:20.230
not me.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.560
Jiansheng is a retired soldier.

00:33:22.644 --> 00:33:24.160
He only has a high school education.

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.350
I've told him many times

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.630
that even if he's self-taught, he needs
to get a college diploma.

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:29.920
But he single-mindedly

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.390
focused on solving cases
and finding missing children.

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:36.190
But nowadays, cadre appointments
emphasize education and youth.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:37.960
Just on that point alone,

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:39.560
he doesn't qualify.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.190
Anti-abduction work

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:44.800
isn't something that can be done
in a day or two.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.870
Before you joined the Anti-abduction
Office, you used to ask me often

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:48.950
about Lin Ran.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.640
You know this.

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:52.870
In the early years,
there were few leads,

00:33:53.177 --> 00:33:54.590
the environment was complex,

00:33:54.844 --> 00:33:56.280
and the technology was crude.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.520
Finding someone was extremely difficult.

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:00.750
And also,

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.870
buyers had little legal awareness.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.430
Their ignorance

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.280
allowed this market
to continue circulating.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.710
That's why we anti-abduction officers
need to have

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:11.710
strong willpower.

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:13.750
Never give up, or abandon hope.

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:16.666
In that regard, you've done very well.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.280
Deng,

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.360
let me tell you,

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.560
Jiansheng can't sit still

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.040
in the hospital.

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:26.360
Let him rest a few days,
and then call him back.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:27.911
Once he has a case to work on,

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.670
he'll recover faster.

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:32.590
I understand,

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:33.510
Sir.

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:35.230
Let me play chess with you.

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:36.230
Come on then.

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:37.150
Let's go.

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:42.260
(Nurse Station)

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:44.940
(Please Keep Quiet)

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.860
(Yin Jiansheng)

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:49.590
Hello,

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:50.510
Officer Du.

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:52.710
I'd like to ask a favor.

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.150
It's about the recent case,

00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:57.560
the Little Spud case.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:58.760
Yes.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.670
Bed 38, turn off your phone
and get some rest.

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:03.840
Don't you know the state
of your own health?

00:35:03.888 --> 00:35:05.940
If you keep pushing like this,
you'll have a stroke.

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:07.030
Okay, I got it.

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.630
Go to sleep.

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:08.150
Okay.

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:09.070
Right away.

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:12.430
Yes, yes.

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:14.070
I...

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.630
I'll come find you in person.

00:35:21.977 --> 00:35:22.990
What are you doing here?

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:24.320
Hello.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.555
May I know if there's a patient
with the surname Yin?

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.030
Yes.

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:27.950
Bed 38.

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:29.280
Thirty-eight...

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.070
Thank you.

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:30.590
Wait,

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:31.800
you can't go in.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.150
Visiting hours are over.

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:34.840
Yes.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:35.800
I know.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.880
But the patient named Yin
is a police officer.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.670
So I'd like to check in on him.

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:40.590
Still no.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:42.120
Why not?

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.630
Visiting hours are over.

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:44.400
Everyone's resting.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.320
Come back tomorrow.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.320
So strict.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.150
Move along.

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:49.110
No flexibility at all.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:50.400
Go on.

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:19.470
Mr. Yin.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.955
The nurse didn't kick you out?

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:26.150
I dropped your name,
and who'd dare kick me out?

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:28.190
Here,

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:29.110
flowers.

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:31.960
I was going to bring you some fruit,

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.022
but then I remembered you have diabetes,
so I got flowers instead.

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:36.150
How's recovery going?

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:40.150
I'm fine. Just need
a couple of days' rest.

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:43.670
How's the team doing lately?

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:46.020
(Linshan People's Hospital.
Please Keep Quiet.)

00:36:46.066 --> 00:36:47.310
Okay, I'm heading over now.

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:04.300
(Baby Missing)

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.630
How's the Little Spud case going?

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.080
Any new leads?

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:08.920
Nothing yet.

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:10.190
But

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:12.920
Jiajia is working on
some kind of database.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:13.840
She says it might help.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:28.960
Still awake, Mr. Yin?

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:29.880
Director Deng.

00:37:29.888 --> 00:37:31.040
What brings you here so late?

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.760
Actually, I came during the day.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.840
You weren't here,
so I came back tonight.

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.200
Hope I didn't disturb your rest.

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:37.510
You're too polite.

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:38.960
I'll just leave this here for you.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:40.880
Have a seat.

00:37:43.088 --> 00:37:43.760
Alright, alright.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.680
You can come out now.

00:37:47.822 --> 00:37:49.190
What a coincidence, Director Deng.

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.240
You see...

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.110
I was afraid of the nurse...

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:55.360
No, not the nurse.

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.920
I was afraid of breaking hospital rules.

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.800
You two talk,

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:02.720
pretend I'm not here.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:05.760
Mr. Yin,

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:07.400
didn't Captain Han tell you

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:08.630
to rest properly?

00:38:10.422 --> 00:38:11.630
If we all listened to doctors,

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.590
the Police Bureau

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:15.230
would've filled every hospital by now.

00:38:15.577 --> 00:38:17.080
This little ailment of mine is nothing.

00:38:17.244 --> 00:38:19.022
It can't be cured, but it won't kill me.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.520
The former director really called it.

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.360
What did he say?

00:38:23.511 --> 00:38:25.320
He said if you were still awake
this late,

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.790
you must be working a case.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:29.280
He guessed right.

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:31.070
Well, in that case,

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:32.110
let's talk.

00:38:32.333 --> 00:38:33.920
Let's talk about the Little Spud case.

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.000
What's the situation now?

00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:36.880
Mr. Yin, let's not talk tonight.

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:38.310
We can talk tomorrow.

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.790
What matters most now
is that you rest well.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.933
The Anti-abduction Office needs you.

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:49.220
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.440
What's going on with Mr. Yin exactly?

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:54.720
What else could it be?

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.230
He's been doing this for years.

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:57.960
He can't sit still.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.488
Even if he can't sit still, he has to.

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:01.360
Han Liang, you tell him

00:39:01.622 --> 00:39:03.230
this time he must listen to the doctor.

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:05.040
He needs to rest and recover properly.

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:07.070
Chief Xiao,

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:10.000
he's worried about the Little Spud case.

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:11.880
There are no leads at all right now.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.520
Unless we find Little Spud,

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:14.760
he won't get better.

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:17.440
So push ahead with the case.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.230
You're the team captain.

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:20.190
You're in charge!

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:21.110
No, Chief Xiao...

00:39:22.666 --> 00:39:24.720
Chief Xiao, Captain Han.
You were looking for me?

00:39:26.244 --> 00:39:26.880
Come here.

00:39:26.888 --> 00:39:27.630
Quickly.

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:30.550
Here, have a seat.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.630
The Little Spud case

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:42.200
has gotten a lot of public attention.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:43.920
What are your thoughts?

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.200
Here's how I see it.

00:39:48.266 --> 00:39:50.711
There has been a recent surge
in child trafficking cases.

00:39:50.733 --> 00:39:51.630
The Little Spud case

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:53.440
has drawn widespread attention
from society.

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:54.400
I believe

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.670
this is a great opportunity
to mobilize the public

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:57.960
to fight abductions.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.630
It can help every household

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:01.190
realize how serious child abduction is.

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:02.920
And with our firm crackdown,

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.190
we can definitely curb these crimes.

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.240
Good.

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:10.000
From the masses,

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.310
to the masses.

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:12.920
That's how our Party

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:15.110
continues to thrive and stay relevant.

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:16.400
Deng,

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.080
that level of awareness is excellent.

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:20.270
So I'm assigning this task to you.

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:21.720
What's your plan?

00:40:22.222 --> 00:40:23.666
The bureau will fully support you.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.400

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:35.590
(We also hope that families and parents)

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:37.880
(who've lost children
don't act out of panic)

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.750
(in moments like this.)

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.440
(Please trust the police.)

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:44.040
(We hope every lost child
will return home soon,)

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:46.520
(and that every family will be reunited.)

00:41:46.533 --> 00:41:48.520
(May the day come when no child
is ever abducted.)

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.560
(Yes, a world without abduction.)

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:51.777
(That requires)

00:41:51.822 --> 00:41:53.630
(joint efforts from both police
and society.)

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:54.733
(Thank you, Director Deng.)

00:41:54.733 --> 00:41:56.480
(Missing Person)
(I know I'll find my grandson.)

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.310
(I won't give up on my child.)

00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.710
(I will keep searching.)

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:00.710
(I'll keep looking.)

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:02.760
(I will definitely bring him back.)

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:04.400
(I will find him, no matter what.)

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:05.550
(We must believe)

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:07.000
(that we can find our children.)

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.666
(Can you help me find her?)

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:13.920
(Thank you, thank you so much.)

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:18.260
(Art Institute Fine Arts Building)
Zhang told me

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:21.355
Professor Yang is the best
sketch artist in Linshan.

00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:22.670
So I thought

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:24.190
maybe he could sketch

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:26.480
a portrait of a boy
based on your features.

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:27.710
Who knows,

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:30.150
it might be what your brother
looks like grown up.

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.360
It's done.

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:35.430
Thank you.

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:37.550
Xiaoxing, come here.

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:44.720
Does it look like him?

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:49.700
(Integrated Database)
It's done.

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:52.670
Is this the database you mentioned?

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:53.760
That was fast.

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:54.760
No way it's that quick.

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:55.880
This is just a trial version.

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:57.880
I just compiled all
of Little Spud's case info

00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:59.920
into a simple, mini-database.
