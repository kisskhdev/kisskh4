WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.280
<i>You cannot go to the festival</i>
<i>with anyone but me tonight.</i>

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.120
It is my sole responsibility
to take you to the festival.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.840
I do want to float a lantern
like everyone else though.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.960
<i>Can you come?</i>

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.320
My father insisted I must bring some lady
to the festival tonight.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.440
Thee.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.400
This is Mom Rajawong Tikumporn Borrirak,
the daughter of Duke Udomsawaddamrong.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.560
From now on, my body and my soul
will long for Thee,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.920
<i>and only for Thee.</i>

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.760
Six months?

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.800
Six months from now,
I must travel back to France.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.960
What will become of us?

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.800
We will remain what we are.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.200
If we give it our all and do our best,

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.640
there is nothing to regret.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.680
I will take care of you the best I can
within these six months.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.120
And I will let you.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.040
Let's start with

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.920
going to the ministry with me.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.440
Going to the ministry?

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.840
Is something the matter?

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.120
MINISTRY OF EDUCATION

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.520
What's the matter?
Why am I meeting the minister?

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.960
Has there been a complaint
regarding my teaching?

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.600
- Please tell me.
- You'll know soon.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.040
Is it good news or otherwise?
Please tell me, Thee.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.520
I need to steel myself.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.600
It is good news.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.680
Very much so?

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.600
Rati.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.800
Please.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.840
It is good news.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.080
Very good news.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.720
"Viscount Rati Jarupich"?

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.640
I am not dreaming, am I?

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.240
Your title has been published
in the <i>Royal Gazette.</i>

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.120
It is reality.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.120
"Viscount Rati Jarupich."

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.640
This title given by His Majesty

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.360
suits you perfectly.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.040
"Viscount Rati Jarupich."

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.000
What does the name mean?

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.800
"Rati" means affection and pleasure.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.400
"Jaru" means elegance.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.120
"Pich" means an intellectual.
A learned man.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.760
You can surmise why I think
the name is beautiful.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.000
Viscount Rati Jarupich.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.920
Count Suratheetamtanapich.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.640
There is one "pich" in my name,
just like yours.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.280
Is that a good thing?

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.640
It is.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.400
It warms my heart to hear it.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.560
It feels like I'll always
have you with me.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.720
From now on, I believe things
will only continue looking up for us.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.440
Mek?

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.880
Dech.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.640
What's wrong? You don't look well.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.040
Is this…

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.720
from yesterday's match?

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.200
You might need to see a doctor.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.360
I doubt it.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.120
I'm fine. I'll be all right
just with some ointment.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.320
You're being stubborn.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.080
I'm not.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.760
I know myself.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.000
I am fine.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.800
I know you got it,

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.120
but I'm worried about you.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.520
Won't you go to the doctor for me?

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.800
I'm begging you.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.000
Of course.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.280
I will.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.560
After work, that is.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.920
Good.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.960
Hold on, Dech.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.640
Look.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.960
I'm almost done saving up.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.760
Winning seven or eight more matches
will likely secure it.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.080
Once I have all the money I need,

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.560
I'll buy my mother's land back.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.280
Will you go with me?

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.960
I want to show you her home.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.520
I'd go even if you didn't ask me to.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.120
It's all thanks to you.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.800
I believe your pouch has brought me luck.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.000
Well…

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.920
I have to go to class.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:35.760
Oh.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.920
Don't…

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.400
forget to go to the doctor.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.200
Study well, Dech.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.000
CIVIL SERVANTS SCHOOL

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.680
Professor Rati has been
granted a viscounty.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.200
<i>Bonjour à tous.</i>

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.320
Professor Rati.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.920
I heard that you've been made a viscount.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.560
Congratulations. You deserve it.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.080
As a baronet,
I pay my respects to you, sir.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.800
We pay our respects, sir.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.920
By the time your year teaching here is up,
I'm afraid I'll have to bow to you too.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.960
Come on.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.800
Please speak to me
the way you all did before.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.920
I remain the same Rati.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.240
I'm no better than anyone else.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.120
The taller one grows, the lower one bows.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.120
The more noble one gets,
the more one needs to stay humble.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.280
That's how one stays respectable.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.520
I simply do my job
to the best of my ability.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.880
Whatever title I am given

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.000
is like a rewarding glass
of refreshing water,

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.640
not a blade to strike someone down.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.480
Hey.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.000
What are you all doing?

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.400
You should congratulate
the new viscount, Lord Ruj.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.920
Professor outranks you now.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.840
You can't call him a servant anymore, sir.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.440
You could be whipped for it now.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.120
What's so funny?

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.480
Move away.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.840
Let's begin our lesson, sirs.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.040
CIVIL SERVANTS SCHOOL

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.840
The test results are not as important
as your comprehension of the lessons.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.160
The tests are simply a tool for me
to know where else to focus on.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.840
Who got the highest scores, sir?

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.320
Was it me?

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.440
You got 7 out of 20, sir.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.480
The highest scores

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.320
belong to Prince Mai

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.760
and Count Suratheetamtanapich.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.080
I noticed that many of you
struggle with vocabulary.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.360
I have compiled an extra sheet
on the matter.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.040
You should have it
with your returned test.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.600
Why do I have two sheets?

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.280
Are you mocking me for my bad results?

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.560
That is not my intention, sir.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.880
You're flaunting your new title now,
aren't you?

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.600
Even if you were made a duke,
it wouldn't change the fact

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.760
that you were born of a kitchen maid.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.680
Baron!

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.680
Don't think you will ever earn my respect.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.880
Bear that in mind.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.720
I take no issue that you call me
a servant boy.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.760
It is the truth, and I accept it.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.440
However, you must recognize that the title
I received was given by His Majesty.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.680
Even if you have no respect for me,

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.520
at least respect His Majesty's judgement
to have granted me the title.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.520
How dare you lecture me?

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.520
Father!

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.120
You think I'll cower just because
you're a nobleman now?

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.120
My lord.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.200
Despite your hatred,
I think you should keep in mind

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.800
that Professor Rati is
the son of the French ambassador.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.520
Professor Rati is the man
Siam begged France for.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.600
He is our nation's guest.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.440
Do you wish to put us at odds with France?

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.240
All you care about is whether
one is born high or low…

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.160
when your own actions sink beneath
even the dregs of society.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.720
If you don't wish to study, leave class.
Do not be a burden to others.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.600
I know you don't mind, Professor,

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.720
but I can't allow his behavior to pass.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.440
The ministry has taken note of the matter,
and soon, word of it will reach France.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.800
Must such a big deal be made of it?

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.720
It affects international relations.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.960
The baron must be punished for it.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.240
What is weighing on your mind?

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.200
Lord Ruj is Mother Rung's younger brother.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.480
He is my uncle.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.680
If this matter blows up,

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.160
I don't think I can face anyone
at Suriyakorn Palace.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.400
Could Lord Ruj simply be removed
from the student list

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.160
instead of legal action being taken
or him being demoted?

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.280
He shall be punished
according to the rules.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.960
Siam will not overlook bad behavior.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.920
If France were to find out

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.840
that one of their own had been
discriminated against

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.920
to the point of verbal and physical abuse,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.840
they would never accept it,
and would likely call for action.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.680
If it came to that,

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.000
the baron could face
even more severe punishment.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.200
It could even mean death.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.360
I understand now.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.560
I can still see unease on your face.

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.240
You didn't ask me

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.520
if I was in pain.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.920
Are you in pain?

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.120
I'm sorry

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.280
for not being able to protect you.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.400
It's all right.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.760
It wasn't your fault.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:27.040
You know, I am angry about what happened
and I'm worried about you.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.680
But I must be careful

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:36.480
because I know you care about
what people think.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.440
If I could reveal my true feelings,

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.560
there is no way I would not show
my concern for you openly.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.800
It still hurts.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.280
In the future…

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.120
I will no longer hold myself back.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.960
I will show my true feelings.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.520
If I am to be ostracized,

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.360
I will bear the brunt of it on my own.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.640
- Please don't joke about such things.
- I meant it.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:16.360
Is not love for another man felt with the
same beating heart as any other love?

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.560
Father.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.880
You should apologize to Professor Rati.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.400
What for? What did I do?

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.800
Do not feign ignorance.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.560
Your behavior is undermining our nation,

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.800
not to mention discrediting
the good name of Suriyakorn.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.480
Resist, if you want.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.680
But if this blows up
and tarnishes Suriyakorn's reputation,

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.680
keep it in mind that it is due to
your own actions, Father.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.400
Hey.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.600
Dech.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:21.640
Dech!

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.280
Buaphan.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.600
What are you doing here?

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.560
Are you here to mock me like your son did?

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.600
You must be dancing with joy
that your son has become a viscount.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.320
You dare look me in the eyes?

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.720
The likes of you should remember
your place in the world.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.400
Ungrateful pigs!

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.960
- Keep that in mind!
- Father, stop!

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.560
- Buaphan, run!
- Never let yourself forget it!

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.920
- Father!
- Let go!

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.960
- Hammer it into your skull! Get back here!
- Father!

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:53.800
Father!

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:56.680
Father!

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.880
Buaphan!

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:58.920
- Father!
- Buaphan!

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:00.560
Buaphan!

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.160
- Father!
- Come back here, Buaphan!

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.400
- Buaphan!
- Father!

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.640
Buaphan! Buaphan!

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.760
Come out here! Come out!

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:14.880
Come out!

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.520
What the hell are you looking at?
Get lost! Go back to work!

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.000
He is…

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.280
He is a viscount now.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.040
He is a viscount now.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.640
I've made my decision about the matter
involving Baron Wijitphakorn.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.200
Please don't try to persuade me
against it, Professor.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.360
Rules are rules,
and punishments are necessary.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.720
To let him off the hook is to allow him
to continue his abuse of power.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.760
You need to put a stop to his bullying.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.480
Don't forget who you are now.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.920
You have every right to defend yourself.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
I admit it infuriates me
each time you let it happen.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.560
Will you hear me out, Your Highness?

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:16.800
Go on.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.880
I am here to ask

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.720
that he be punished according to the law.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.280
You are not asking for pardon?

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.200
I was going to.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.000
But after speaking to Thee…

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.960
I mean, Count Suratheetamtanapich,

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.840
I learned that if he goes unpunished,
it will only do more harm,

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.400
both to Lord Ruj and to the relationship
between our two nations.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.400
So it was the good count
who clarified that point.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:05.160
SENG CHAROEN

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.040
Dig in.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.320
My treat.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.440
Did you fetch me from home
just so we could eat <i>pagrim kaitao?</i>

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.360
My dear Young Master,

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.320
please don't think badly of me, sir.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:32.080
I heard your father slapped the professor.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.680
I'm worried about you.
How are you doing?

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.880
It wasn't me who did it.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.480
Why shouldn't I be all right?

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.800
At the end of the day,
he is still your father.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.760
You can say it doesn't concern you,

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.600
but I don't believe you.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:49.840
Look.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.960
I'm here if you need someone to talk to.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.680
- Are you?
- Of course.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.720
Ow!

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.160
Does it hurt?

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.360
No. I'm only joking.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.440
You jester.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.400
I didn't want you to be upset.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.840
I'm really here if you need to talk.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.440
Well…

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.840
Can I talk to you about something?

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.320
Go on.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:28.120
Someone promised me he would see a doctor,

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.520
but he ended up doing anything but.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:37.000
What do you think I should do to him?

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.000
I think

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:46.240
you should calm down
and finish your bowl of dessert.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.080
I was going to go, but the rickshaw
has never been busier.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.560
Finish your dessert.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.840
We're going together.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.400
Yes, sir.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.600
Aunt Porn,

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:05.720
give me five more bowls.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.120
Coming up!

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.480
Are you hungry?

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.920
It's my treat. I want you to eat well.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.280
Here. I'll even feed you.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.520
How is it?

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.960
It's good, isn't it?

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.880
You will probably like it too.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.320
Won't you have a taste?

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.440
I've had my fill.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.440
Come on.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.800
That's too big of a bite.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.440
- Are you pranking me?
- Of course not.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.360
- Are you sure?
- Of course I am.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.000
- Really sure?
- Really sure.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.920
- You're not joking?
- Of course not.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.920
Mr. Rati.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.640
What news, Kui?

00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:00.080
I've asked the attendants
at Suriyakorn Palace,

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:04.800
and they said Lord Ruj has been so furious
that no one dares get close to him.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.560
As for your mother Buaphan…

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:09.240
What's happened to Buaphan?

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.600
She is currently safe, sir.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.800
The attendants said
Young Master Dech is protecting her,

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.120
but no one can say
how long she will remain safe.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.760
I need to see her.

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:22.520
What can you do for her if you go there?
You can't just barge into the palace.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.200
I think you should go
to Count Theerathon, sir.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.400
If he's with you,
he might be able to do something.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:35.960
That's very smart of you, Kui.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.440
And I know it, sir.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.720
<i>Kanom bueang</i> this way.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.160
Come and get it here.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.280
Can I have some <i>kanom bueang,</i> please?

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.280
I was just on my way to see you.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.200
I beat you to it.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.800
I got some<i> kanom bueang</i> for you
on the way here.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.280
I'm afraid a few pieces
might have gone missing though.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.080
Thank you.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.240
I have a feeling it was your mouth that
must account for the missing pieces.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.080
Are you busy after work?

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:38.640
I was wondering if you could come with me
to Suriyakorn Palace to see my mother.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.800
Of course.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.360
I will go grab my bag,
and we'll go in my car.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:46.920
Father.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.800
Are you here on state matters?

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.000
I am here to see you, actually.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:58.120
I need to talk to you about the wedding
between you and Lady Pa.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.520
I know you're devoted to
serving our country.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:21.520
I've been persuading your grandmother
to postpone it, but now…

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.800
Now, I'm afraid I can no longer avoid it.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.320
I think the time is right for you as well.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.120
You want me to marry someone I don't love?

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:36.040
Lady Pa is the perfect lady for you.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.760
I believe you will come to love her
as time goes by.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.680
Like you and Mother?

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.040
Is this what Grandmother said to you too
when she wanted you to get married?

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.360
And what happened?

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.760
Did you ever fall for Mother?

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:57.920
You married Mother for the honor
and glory of our families.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.800
Meanwhile, the woman you love
lives in the servants' quarters

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.600
where you can never set foot.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.840
All to satisfy Grandmother.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.960
In your relationships,

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.120
is anyone happy?

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.720
Do you truly want the same for me?

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.920
My troubles are unlike yours.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.080
I'm worried about you, son.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.240
I want you to choose the right path.

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.640
I take care of my responsibilities.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.400
I am serving my country.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.600
I work hard to prove myself.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.080
Is that not enough to honor our family?

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.800
You can already see
how rough the path up ahead is.

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:09.360
Do you insist on taking it?

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.480
Yes.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.480
To struggle with someone I love

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.840
seems like a struggle I can be happy with.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.400
Will you pass some books to Tiwa for me?

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.320
Mr. Rati?

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.680
It really is you.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.560
I came here to see my father.
I was just leaving, actually.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.680
This is good.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.000
I need to talk to you.

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.040
I have quietly admired Thee
for a long time.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:09.400
I was glad when my father
and his grandmother wanted us to marry.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.720
But I think…

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.120
Thee is in love with someone else.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:25.400
My father is the Minister of Education,
the ministry where Thee works.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:28.480
He would never allow me to be humiliated.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:34.520
He doesn't care who Thee is in love with.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.240
All he cares about is propriety.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.960
But I am not like my father.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.160
I do not wish to take away anyone's love.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.440
If he doesn't love me,

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.960
I don't want him.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.840
But whoever it is that he loves
must be perfect for him.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:57.080
Someone who is better than me.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.080
What do you think, Mr. Rati?

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.560
Are you more perfect for him than I am?

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.480
What were you talking to Lady Pa about?

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.280
Nothing.

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.880
Please tell me.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.520
It's really nothing.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.760
Let's go.

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.400
We need to go to Suriyakorn Palace.

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.360
Oh, here he comes. Will you put it down?

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.520
Wash your hands
before you touch anything, Phu.

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.080
It's safe to say
my cooking remains impeccable.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.000
Dear Buaphan, you haven't stopped smiling
since you learned that

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.240
your son has been made a viscount.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:13.120
You should be very comfortable in life now
to have a son you can rely on.

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.720
When is he going to come
and take you away?

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.120
He is not my son.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.080
He is Lady Rung's son.

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.760
If he's not your son, how come you haven't
stopped smiling about him all day?

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:28.560
Can't a woman just be happy?

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.400
Tight-lipped, isn't she?

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.400
This woman…

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.480
You must be ecstatic.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.720
Buaphan, come here!

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.760
- Please let me go, sir!
- Come here!

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.160
- Come here!
- Sir!

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.480
- Just come with me!
- Sir, please!

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:51.040
Your son doesn't know his place.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.600
I'll drag you to school and show everyone

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.640
that his mother
is nothing but a servant in my kitchen!

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.640
- Come here!
- No!

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.760
- I'm not going, sir! No!
- Come!

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:06.560
If you're using me to hurt the viscount,
I refuse to obey, my lord.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.160
I would rather die!

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.360
My lord, please stop.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.800
- Please, sir. I'm begging you.
- My lord, please.

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.400
Stay out of this!

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.400
Come here!

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.480
Father!

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.720
Let Buaphan go.

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:20.760
You're crossing the line.

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:21.960
Stay out of my business, Dech.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:23.760
Come here!

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:26.520
Let go!

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.880
Grandfather wants to see you.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.880
Why?

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.440
Because you slapped Rati.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.520
I told him.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.200
And why on earth did you do that?

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.720
You refused to take responsibility
for your actions.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.120
I don't want to be in trouble

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.600
so I asked Grandfather for help.

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.120
Dech.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.880
Take Buaphan away.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.280
Stop it!

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:46.640
- Did I say you could go?
- Father!

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.440
- Where do you think you're going?
- Father!

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:49.520
Come here! Come here!

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.040
Father, let her go.

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.240
Father!

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:55.840
Let her go!

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:56.880
Buaphan!

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.040
Stop!

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:01.720
Father!

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.280
Father!

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:08.920
- Buaphan.
- Father!

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.080
Buaphan.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:11.920
Father, please!

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.160
Stop it!

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.680
Go! Don't ever come back!

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.560
Buaphan!

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.800
Father.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.960
<i>You married Mother for the honor</i>
<i>and glory of our families.</i>

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:53.520
Meanwhile, the woman you love
lives in the servants' quarters

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.280
where you can never set foot in.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.960
All to satisfy Grandmother.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.800
<i>In your relationships,</i>

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.600
<i>is anyone happy?</i>

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.400
Where are you going, my lord?

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:48.680
Hello.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.880
We apologize for barging in.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.680
There was no gatekeeper at the door.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.440
Father is upstairs with Grandfather.
He will be here shortly.

00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.400
How are you, Rati?

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:02.680
I apologize on behalf of my father
for the other day.

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:03.960
I'm all right.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.600
There was no serious harm done.

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.120
I heard you have been helping
my mother Buaphan, Baronet.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.360
Thank you.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.960
Not at all.

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.360
Mr. Rati has some concerns.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.080
He wants to meet Buaphan for a moment.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.240
Can you fetch her for us?

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.400
It's all right.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.280
I will meet her in the kitchen.

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.920
Something happened this morning.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:33.360
Father wanted to take Buaphan
to school to embarrass you.

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.240
So she…

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.640
She ran away.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.400
I already have men looking for her,

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.640
though we haven't found her.

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.200
My mother, Buaphan,

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.840
did anyone find her?

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:15.639
Excuse me.

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:18.960
Have you seen a woman
of about this height named Buaphan?

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:20.520
Excuse me.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.920
Have you seen a woman
of about this height named Buaphan?

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:23.960
No.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:26.280
Thank you.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:27.800
Mom!

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.560
Stop, Rati.

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:32.239
Leave this matter to me.

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:42.840
- Two-baht worth of these, please.
- Of course. Just a moment.

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.239
- One cup of hot tea, please.
- Of course.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.880
Do you really think Mek would do it?

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.159
He's never lost, brother.

00:34:55.239 --> 00:34:56.719
He must.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.680
He promised to lose this time.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.880
The money from the bet
is bigger than his ego.

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.400
A rigged match?

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:17.920
Mek.

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.000
Dech.

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.200
Are you going to deliberately lose?

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.320
I…

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.120
Why are you doing this?

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.320
If I don't give them the money tomorrow,

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.040
they'll sell my mother's land
to someone else.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.760
Hey, Mek. Are you ready?

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.080
The match is about to begin. Come on.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.320
Mek. Don't you dare.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.360
Don't worry about me.

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:53.440
I'll be fine.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.920
- Go for it!
- You can do it, Mek.

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.520
Hey. Go for it!

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.120
- Mek!
- Hey! Stop it!

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.880
- Mek!
- You can't get in!

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:27.240
Let go of me!

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.840
- Stay away!
- Mek!

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:36.120
- Mek! Get up!
- Don't let him.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.200
Let go of me!

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:46.520
Mek!

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:48.840
Mek.

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:05.240
Buaphan is a good woman.

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:07.840
She must be hiding somewhere safe.

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.520
I have men looking for her.

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.840
We'll have news of her soon.

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.120
Thank you.

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.040
Have you eaten yet?

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.480
I can't stomach anything.

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:27.800
Will you have dinner with me if I ask?

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.080
What about this?

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:36.800
Will you at least eat this?

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.360
Where did you get it?

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:45.120
I had Mhay look for someone
with a fairy floss machine.

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.400
Being the good man that he is,
Mhay actually found someone.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:52.000
I wanted to celebrate your viscounty
with some fairy floss, you see.

00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:58.640
Eat.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.920
Before it melts away.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:07.800
I can't help but worry about Buaphan.

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.920
Did you hear what Baronet Dech said?

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:18.080
When she heard the baron
wanted to use her to hurt you, she ran.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.200
Because she loves me,

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.640
she doesn't want my name to be sullied.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:27.920
You're right.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:33.600
That's why you must take care of yourself
to match the love she has for you.

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.040
I don't want
to sully your name either, Thee.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:42.440
Thee.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:45.160
Please marry Lady Pa.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.880
I've thought it through.

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:55.720
Marrying Lady Pa is the best thing to do.

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:07.000
You don't want to sully my name…

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.640
because you love me?

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.680
Is this your indirect way
of telling me you love me?

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.680
Thee.

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.320
You're awake.

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:36.240
How are you feeling?

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.720
Does it still hurt?

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.960
Your money. I was asked to give it to you.

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:58.800
Now that you have enough money,
you can buy your mother's land back.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.440
Quit fighting.

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.480
You don't need to get yourself hurt
like this anymore.

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.960
What's wrong?
Why are you staring at me like that?

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:25.800
Mek.

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:27.960
Can you hear me?

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:31.280
Mek?

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:37.600
Mek! What's wrong?

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.000
Mek.

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:40.000
Mek!

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.040
Mek!

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.560
Wait right here. I'll fetch you a doctor.

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:51.760
Mek!

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:18.720
Mek, watch out!

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.160
You're all right. I'm here.

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.760
Mek!

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.800
Are you pretending not to understand?

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.320
I don't love Lady Pa.

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:41.200
I want to spend the rest of my life
with you, Rati.

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:47.960
What we have is a fleeting moment of joy.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.360
In less than six months,
I will be back in France.

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.760
And when that time comes,
what we have right here

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.520
will be gone in the blink of an eye.

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:58.120
We will do anything we can
to keep it alive.

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.680
Can you keep this fairy floss
from melting?

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.200
There has to be a way.

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:15.640
Soon enough, people will talk about us.

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.400
The good name of
Count Suratheetamtanapich will be gone.

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.440
I cannot do that to you.

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:27.240
It shouldn't be wrong
to be true to one's self.

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:29.880
Thee.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:33.440
Love between two men is impossible.

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:35.880
This is the truth.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:40.400
Is my love not true, then?

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:43.200
Count Suratheetamtanapich.

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:45.800
Viscount Rati Jarupich.

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:50.560
Both of our names carry the word "pich,"
which means "intellectuals."

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:55.120
Whatever obstacles lie in our path,
we shall take them in stride.

00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:00.040
- I think it's impossible--
- Will you please stop saying that?

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:02.960
How, then?

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:06.680
How will you make them understand?

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:11.960
Is there a way that allows us
to be happy together?

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.040
Will you please tell me?

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:22.280
Can you really walk away from me?

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:29.120
I'm doing this to protect you, Thee.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:37.440
Come with me.

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:47.480
Thee, people are staring.

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:51.280
I told you I would show my feelings openly

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:53.280
and I wouldn't hold myself back from you.

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:09.600
Have you seen Mek?

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.640
Mek wouldn't be here.

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.440
He must be seriously injured.

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.000
Are you done?

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:26.920
Good job keeping your promise.

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.640
I'll even give you this.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:46.920
LAND DEED

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:36.000
Shame on you.

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:01.040
With the deity of Mai Maan Shrine
as my witness,

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:07.880
I will love and cherish you
and only you, Rati.

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.280
I will do everything possible
to make you happy,

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.520
and I will do everything in my power
to make our love possible.

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:25.880
I don't know right now
how to make that happen…

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.960
but as long as you don't give up on me,

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.920
I won't give up on us either.

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.840
I will do everything possible

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:41.720
to let us be together
like any other couple,

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.840
no matter how hard it gets,

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:49.480
and even if it costs me my life.

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:56.920
Please help me in this pursuit
so we can grow old together.

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:28.320
I, Count Suratheetamtanapich,
solemnly swear.

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.040
Your ears aren't working properly.

00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:56.000
Can you hear me?

00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:58.360
- Can you hear me at all?
- I can hear you just fine!

00:47:58.440 --> 00:47:59.880
NEXT EPISODE

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:01.040
Why did you kiss me?

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:03.960
I'm kissing my friend,
the way people kiss their pets.

00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:07.400
<i>I had a lot of fun flying a kite today.</i>

00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:09.400
<i>Prince Mai sure takes good care of you.</i>

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:10.880
I guess I'm now useless.

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.680
<i>Would you be up for a bet?</i>

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:15.680
- What are we betting, Your Highness?
- The professor, perhaps.
