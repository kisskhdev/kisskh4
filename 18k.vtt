00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:35.451


00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:45.160
Okay, I got it, Dad.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.080
Thanks.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.080
Drive safe. Gotta go.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.800
What did your dad say?

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.800
He said back when

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.280
he worked at the foreign company,

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.880
he knew a friend in foreign trade.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.720
Deals in plush toys.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.800
He might buy your cotton.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.640
But he can only try.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.160
No guarantee.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.199
Thanks.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.560
Ge Kaiyang, you actually can cook?

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.720
It won't be

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.920
some inedible mess,

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.000
huh?

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.040
I'm talented at cooking.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.320
My parents were busy when I was little,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.680
so I'd often make instant noodles,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.520
and that's where it all started.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.280
Alright. I'll give it a taste.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.320
Can't wait.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.280
Didn't you say

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.520
you'd make me malatang?

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.160
[Malatang?]

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.480
[Don't make it here.]

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.640
Can't stand the chili fumes.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.079
Just kidding.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.000
Have you eaten?

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.079
Not hungry.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.320
Fed the pigeons yet?

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.840
Nope.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.320
Young lady.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.520
You're quite pretty.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.760
Why hang around

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.320
my grandson all day?

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.320
Don't let his looks fool you.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.120
He's dirt poor.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.520
Don't laugh.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.600
We're broke.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.120
Think carefully.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.520
Are you okay?

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.400
Can you go feed the pigeons?

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.640
Think it over, girl.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.120
[Yeah, granny,]

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.120
[I will.]

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.840
She likes joking.

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:31.680
Pay no mind.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.360
Our products

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.920
have strict raw material standards.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.880
We usually don't consider

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.520
materials with unknown sources.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.520
Here, feel this.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.800
Feel the quality.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.360
This is what happens

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.720
when we handpick

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.079
raw materials.

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:56.320
I see. How about this?

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.360
I'll give you a discount.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.440
I really need the money.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.920
It's not about the money.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.840
If I hadn't known Lu

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.840
for decades,

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.520
[you wouldn't even]

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.680
[be inside our factory.]

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.880
[But honestly,]

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.880
[I checked carefully.]

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.840
[Your batch of cotton]

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.000
[is actually quite good.]

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.200
[Meets our standards.]

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.680
Deal.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.280
Thank you, thank you!

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.280
You've helped me a ton.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.880
Thanks!

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.279
Thanks a lot.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.320
Feeling generous today?

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.640
I promised, didn't I?

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.240
Treat you to dinner once I get the money.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.680
A drink isn't too much, right?

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.280
Your 200k IOU turned into

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.520
only 85k in goods payment.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.680
Spend wisely.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.640
If it weren't for you,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.840
I probably wouldn't have gotten anything.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.880
I want to talk to you

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.960
about something.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.840
I could

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.400
give you some as a commission.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.280
Wait, Ge Kaiyang.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.720
I helped you

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.480
not for your money.

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:00.160
That's not what I meant.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.120
Thanks.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.640
Back in Canada,

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.680
we never would've guessed

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.160
we'd be doing this together.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.200
I think

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.160
I should start a debt collection

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.520
company.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.160
Right?

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.960
Sure.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.280
I'm in.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.160
This way I can

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.240
make ends meet.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.840
Then we'd make the news.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.680
Ten years studying abroad,

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.159
ended up as debt collectors.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.120
How's that?

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.760
Sounds good.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:03.960
What's up?

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.480
The job.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:13.840
I got the job.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.800
The company informed me

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.880
that I can join anytime.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.880
That's good.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.800
Aren't you happy about it?

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.720
I'm being honest,

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.240
but don't make fun of me, okay?

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.800
After studying abroad for years,

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.680
the only job I can find back home

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.040
is at a study abroad agency.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.720
No debt collection company for us.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.360
Aren't you hot?

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.080
At least

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.360
turn on the fan.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.960
Need help?

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.159
How often do you take this?

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:55.360
I didn't see you take it yesterday.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.200
It says

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.880
"24-hour efficacy".

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.280
That's all nonsense.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.680
Once every two days is fine.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.240
Won't die.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.560
Says who? You're not a doc.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.520
Listen,

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.400
this is no joke.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.120
[No insulin left in the fridge.]

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.640
[I'll take you to the hospital tomorrow.]

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.600
Your fasting blood sugar

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.360
and A1C levels

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.760
are already past the danger zone.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:35.560
You need to be hospitalized.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.000
Listen to the doc.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.080
I don't want to.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.560
You should listen to the doctor.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:45.920
Can't believe I fall

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.280
for your words about the insulin.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.640
Ma'am,

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:50.880
at this stage,

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.120
hospitalization is a must.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.720
If you don't control your sugar,

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.200
complications can easily arise.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.520
That would be dangerous.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.720
Is it that serious?

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.760
Are you worried about the cost?

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:01.840
Well, most of the

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.000
hospitalization expenses

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.040
can be reimbursed.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.480
Including the insulin.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:08.720
Once

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.200
your blood sugar stabilizes,

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.200
you can be discharged.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.720
I'll also prescribe two weeks'

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.240
worth of insulin for you to take away.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.200
Two whole weeks'

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.520
worth of insulin

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.160
to take home?

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.000
Right.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.280
Saves a lot of money.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.720
Fine, admit me.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.720
That's right.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.200
I'll write you a form.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.640
Here, take them back.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.160
Thanks.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.320
Patient's name?

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:36.840
Huang Shufen.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.200
Here.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.120
Paid the fees.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.440
Keep these papers.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.240
Huang Shufen!

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.720
How dare you call me by my name?

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.120
What are you eating?

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.280
Let me see.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:22.960
Let me see.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.960
Where did you get this?

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.560
From the cabinet.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.120
You can't eat this.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.120
Go check them.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.520
Where's my ID?

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.280
What are you doing?

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.160
Take a photo for memories.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.080
November 8th, 1946.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.320
Scorpio.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:52.960
What?

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.160
Zodiac. Scorpio.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.120
So?

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.000
Scorpios are kinda grudging.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.320
Grudging?

00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.560
Huh.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.600
When was my grandpa's birthday?

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.280
What now?

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.040
Just curious if you two were meant to be.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:09.960
Huh?

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.840
July 4th, 1941.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.880
Cancer.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.360
Why are you staring at me?

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.680
Were we meant to be?

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:26.600
Nope.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.080
Ugh, stop annoying me.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.200
Get out of my sight.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.600
Stop watching over me.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:33.920
And remember to

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.920
feed the pigeons.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.360
You've told me a million times.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.360
Fly them twice a day.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.160
Got it.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.000
Why do you care more about

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.120
the pigeons than me?

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.720
Those pigeons

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.720
were all left by your grandpa.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.160
So I wasn't left by Grandpa?

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.520
Unless my dad

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.080
wasn't my grandpa's real son.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.080
Or I wasn't my dad's real son.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.200
You little rascal.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.880
Why do you talk so sassy?

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.800
It hurts. Are you really a patient?

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:00.920
I'm just in the hospital,

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.000
not on my deathbed!

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:03.560
Don't jinx it!

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.600
Alright, alright.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:07.680
Go home.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.920
Pass me the remote.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.920
Why are you so nice to animals?

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.480
I always see you talking to them.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.680
You wouldn't understand, kiddo.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.840
Dealing with animals

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.080
is much easier than dealing with people.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:25.720
Got it.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.560
Remote, the remote.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.640
Need to get new pigeon grit.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:32.720
Head to

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.720
the back of the flower-and-bird market,

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.720
look for Old Man Qian,

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.520
and buy it from him.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.080
I know exactly how many

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.280
pigeons I have.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.360
If even one's missing when I get back,

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.280
I'll beat you black and blue.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.720
I love eating pigeon meat.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.720
Say that again, I'll hold a grudge.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.920
[I brought all this for you two.]

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.520
[You're staying at her house,]

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.040
[and you need to get along with her.]

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:57.440
Right?

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.680
And here's some fruit.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.760
Your mom bought all this,

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.080
told me to bring it over.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.240
So many snacks.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.720
My mom bought all these?

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.120
Don't lie to me.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.520
Maybe they were just

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.280
free samples

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.360
with the fruit she bought.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.440
Your mom misses you a lot.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.120
She's just tough on the outside.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:22.520
Oh, right.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.080
You were looking for a job, right?

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.320
So

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.640
how's that

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.680
working out?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:28.560
I've got it.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.760
Impressive! That's my girl.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.080
But Dad, I was thinking

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.480
once my life gets a bit more settled,

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.760
and Mom knows

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.720
I'm doing fine

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.920
back in China,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.160
maybe she'll let it go.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:43.480
Alright.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.840
Job's settled.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.520
But staying at someone's place

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.120
isn't a long-term solution.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.280
Should I rent you an apartment?

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.200
No, Dad, thanks.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.840
It's nice having company.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:52.400
I'm good.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.760
You drive so much, must be tiring.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.920
I don't want to be

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.680
an extra burden.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.200
I'll rent my own place

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.800
once I start earning.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:00.840
Alright then.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.160
Alright, I'm off.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.200
Drive safely.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.720
It's a bit heavy, be careful.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.760
It really is.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:07.640
See you.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.320
Take care.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.360
Go on.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.600
Go.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.560
I'll wait till you go in.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.080
[Okay, goodbye.]

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.120
[You're back.]

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.400
Come clean.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.120
Who were you on a date with?

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.760
What date?

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.200
Just helping a friend.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.120
I'm exhausted these days.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.320
Then who bought

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.040
all these snacks?

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.560
No way you bought them yourself.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.960
My dad bought them for us.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.440
Your dad?

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.480
Lucky I have proof.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:08.960
So tell me,

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:09.720
who's the guy

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.760
bringing you food in the photo?

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:12.480
What's

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.960
really going on between you two?

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.560
You made my dad look

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.920
really handsome.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.280
And young.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.080
This is really your dad?

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.360
Yep, for real.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:29.720
To be honest,

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.920
this is the first photo

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.840
I've taken with my dad since I grew up.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:34.440
Send them all to me. Now.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:36.520
Send them all.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:42.880
Done.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.280
Great shot. Really good.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:04.920
Cynthia.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:05.640
I have a general idea

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.560
of your background.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:07.920
I don't know how the boss

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.120
introduced our department to you,

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:09.840
but let me

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.880
briefly explain your role.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.240
Your job will involve

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.760
everything from client acquisition

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:14.840
to handling all

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.160
academic programs

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.440
once students join our agency,

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.120
including language training,

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.320
document preparation, portfolio design.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.760
Every student has

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:22.520
different

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:23.320
learning needs,

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.040
so you'll need to

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:24.960
customize service plans for each.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.200
Basically,

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.720
you can think of it as

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.400
personalized one-on-one service.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.040
Resume says you

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.640
studied economics, right?

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.120
That's great.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.200
I want my kid to study economics too.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.600
Easier to find a job.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.400
Sweetie, do you like economics?

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.280
She's still so young.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.880
She doesn't know what she really wants.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.520
We can't let her choose based on whims.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:49.960
She doesn't understand anything.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.920
I need to plan for her.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.560
But she's only in 8th grade.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.320
Isn't it a bit early to consider this?

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.560
Not at all.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.160
It's often said kids

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.640
have to get a head start.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.320
Ideally,

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.680
she should go abroad for high school.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.760
She's been taking English tutoring

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.240
since kindergarten.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.920
Already working on TOEFL scores.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:13.400
Oh, come on.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.760
Stop playing with your phone.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.520
Language tests

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.440
might change in the future.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.880
And studying abroad

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.680
is for the kid herself.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.080
Shouldn't we respect

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.560
her own thoughts?

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.200
No matter what changes,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:31.840
we need to

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.160
be fully prepared.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.520
Kids don't know anything.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:36.720
It's up to parents

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.600
to plan for them.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.760
Have you considered the overall cost

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.080
of studying abroad?

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.760
No need to worry about that.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:47.680
We've got it all figured out.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:50.600
Okay.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.640
My apologies, I overstepped.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.800
I'll prepare some materials

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.880
on international high schools

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.120
for you to look over, okay?

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:00.800
Yeah.

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:07.560
Their food is pretty good here.

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:11.400
How was your first day?

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.200
Not bad, I think.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.160
The offices are spacious,

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.680
and the supervisor is nice.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:23.960
Usually when you say that,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.720
there's a "but" coming.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:29.680
Well...

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:32.760
To be honest,

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.200
this job comes with a lot

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.200
of responsibility.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.760
I don't want to

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.520
make decisions for others.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.080
All those kids

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.800
wanting to study abroad...

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:43.800
I'd prepare

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.560
so much of their materials.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.160
If they get in, fine.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.200
If they don't,

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:49.760
all that

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.840
admissions pressure

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.800
would fall on me.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.040
I don't think I can handle that.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.040
But you're not

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.440
making the decision for them.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:17:59.560
Studying abroad

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:00.720
is their own choice.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.440
You're just helping them

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.760
with one part of the process.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.840
And whether they get accepted

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:07.600
depends on

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.960
their own abilities.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:09.680
Right?

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:11.880
You can't always

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.440
do exactly what you love.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.040
I don't like driving ride-hailing either.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.200
You don't have much

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:17.920
work experience yet.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:19.160
You can take this job

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.200
for now,

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:20.800
you know,

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.560
and keep an eye out

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.400
for something better.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:31.880
Dad.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.240
Do you think I'm being

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.200
too fussy or demanding?

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.480
Of course not!

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.520
My daughter should

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.320
have high standards

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:43.560
for her job.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.440
You should do something you love.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:46.760
I get it.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.080
Okay.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:57.560
To celebrate

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.560
my daughter landing a job,

00:18:58.880 --> 00:18:59.480
I'm gonna

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.520
take extra fares today.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:01.120
Great.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.120
Reply your messages.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.400
Dad, slow down a bit.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:05.920
See ya.

if we're talking vocals,

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.800
Kaiyang.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.480
Don't bring up that jinx.

Who's Kaiyang?

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.080
Why didn't you invite him out?

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.240
He doesn't deserve it.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:01.800
Who are you talking about?

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.320
Ge Kaiyang?

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.920
He's doing designated driving now.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:06.960
Who?

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:07.800
Ge Kaiyang.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:08.560
Doing what?

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.440
Designated driver.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.640
Louder.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.760
Ge Kaiyang is doing designated driver.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:13.920
No way.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:14.960
For real.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.840
My bestie's car got scratched by a DD,

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.280
just fixing the wrap cost over 10 grand.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.600
I heard it's him.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:20.800
- No way.
- I swear.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.880
Call him.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.880
I deleted his WeChat ages ago.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.920
But you've got his number, right?

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.160
Yeah, definitely.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.080
Come on.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:32.800
You really want me to call?

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.200
Fine.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:40.520
Hey, bro.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:42.880
No,

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:44.560
my last few jobs

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.360
all got canceled today.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.400
I'm all the way

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:49.560
out in the High-Tech Zone now.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.200
It's pretty far.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.960
That's fine,

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:55.720
I'll wait around.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.480
Thanks for your concern.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:05.600
Hello,

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.920
this is Lidao Designated Driver.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:10.520
Yes, it is.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:11.560
[Well,]

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.400

Thanks, really.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.600
So he really is doing DD.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:27.240
Way to go.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.160
No way.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:30.560
That is Ge Kaiyang.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:33.640
Dude!

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.600
At this moment,

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.560
I have to sing a party song!

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.800
Come on then!

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:39.560
Let's go!

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.440
Where's the mic?

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.040
Here.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.720
Pick a song for me!

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.560
Go sing with him.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:46.320
Go on.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.720
Put on a Phoenix Legend track!

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:51.520
Don't worry,

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.800
I'm still in the High-Tech Zone.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.000
I've already got an order

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:55.640
come in.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.480
No worries.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:57.560
Talk later.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.840
Gotta take me to your hometown, deal?

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.160
Stop! Over here.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.200
Don't go!

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.280
Come on.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.760
Hurry up.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.600
Kaiyang?

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.720
Long time no see.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.280
Small world!

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.400
You're actually doing designated driver?

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.080
Ling.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.880
Kaiyang, the karaoke king.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.360
That's him?

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.560
Say hello.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.800
Hi, Kaiyang.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.560
Hey.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.120
They said you're doing DD,

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.120
I didn't believe it.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.040
So, experiencing life?

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.640
Kaiyang,

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.360
your colleague

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.320
will be here soon.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.040
You're such a pain.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.080
Just go.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:41.960
Whenever

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.720
I need it, I'm calling you.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:45.560
Absolutely.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.000
Calm down.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000
You guys still need a DD?

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:48.560
Hold up.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.600
Of course we do.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.600
I don't trust anyone else

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.720
with my car.

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:53.360
Exactly.

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.240
Good thing you're here.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:55.600
Ling,

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.680
aren't you into Vlogging?

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:57.840
Take some shots of him later.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:59.160
No problem.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:00.640
So...

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.280
Kaiyang, here you go.

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:06.200
Alright.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.400
Thank you.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.200
Unlock it.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.280
You guys get in first.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.320
Go on, hop in.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.400
I'll do a quick check.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.480
You can get in first.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:20.800
It's fine, I'll wait for you.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.200
Just to confirm,

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.800
there's a scratch on your rear bumper.

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:41.800
Forget it.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.600
Why are you being so serious?

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.200
Standard procedure,

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.080
just to avoid disputes.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.080
Okay, sure.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.680
Where are we heading?

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:50.640
Ling,

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:52.720
where are we going?

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.280
Let's go to Pingli Island.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.480
Pingli Island.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.200
That's over 100 kilometers.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.120
We're going for a drive.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:03.960
You'll make more money too.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:05.880
All right.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.400
Just get in,

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.600
I'll put the bike in the trunk.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.560
Wait a sec, please.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:18.960
You smell.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:20.240
Perfume.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.960
Kaiyang, top-notch service.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.720
You bet!

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:43.800
Back in the day,

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:44.720
he only drove supercars.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.400
His driving skills are first-class,

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.160
right?

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.760
He really feels different now.

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.280
He's a lot steadier.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.560
So, why out here doing DD?

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.560
Experiencing life?

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:54.960
Don't bring that up.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.000
It's a bit of a sore spot.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.320
Why?

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:00.480
Got dumped?

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.560
Way worse than that.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.680
See that mall up ahead?

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:07.640
That one?

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.440
He used to own shares in it.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.840
And what happened later?

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.880
Go on, tell them.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.800
It's seized by the court.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.200
Right.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.640
And what about your uncle?

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:25.360
Tell us.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.760
Got nailed for bribery and corruption.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.200
It's all online.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.800
Times really change, huh.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.280
Your parents doing okay?

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.720
Sentenced already.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:52.680
Kaiyang,

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:55.360
I'm so sorry.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:57.600
You didn't even

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:58.560
finish school.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.360
Your dad and I dragged you down.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:03.320
It's okay.

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.920
He kept saying that me being in school

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.000
is just burning money.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.600
So, just quit.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.640
The lawyer said

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:16.560
you scraped together

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:17.840
every last cent for us.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.840
What are you going to live on later?

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.640
What are you doing now?

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.800
You're so thin now, and tanned.

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:27.800
Doing odd jobs?

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:29.880
Making up the losses

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.120
is what I should do.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.000
And that money

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.560
was yours in the first place.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.760
I haven't lost that much weight.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:40.800
I've just been exercising.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.280
Have you found a job now?

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.080
I've got a steady one,

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:55.800
don't worry.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:56.920
And stop grilling me.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.280
Just look after yourself.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.400
As Grandma said,

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.760
"Everyone should mind their own life."

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.520
You take care of you.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.640
And,

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.280
I checked online,

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.160
looks like I can bring hair dye in,

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.160
so next time I'll bring you some.

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.360
Kaiyang,

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.760
don't worry about me.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.880
Go see your dad when you can.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:30.840
His prison's far away.

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.600
It's not easy to visit.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.280
Kaiyang,

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.280
do you blame us?

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.440
I don't hate you.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:00.640
Kaiyang,

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.400
lift your head.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:11.600
Kaiyang,

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.480
look up so I can see you.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.080
Take care of yourself.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.360
Eat properly.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.240
Yu, got enough footage yet?

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.760
Remember to give him a five-star review.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.480
Definitely.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:32.960
Make sure he looks cool on camera.

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.720
[I can't tell if she's acting out]

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.040
[or if she's been pushed into it.]

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.560
[Her mom's odd, too.]

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.960
[When she's in Canada with her,]

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
[she'd call me every few days]

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:52.840
[on voice chat]

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.320
[and talk for hours.]

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.880
[I was embarrassed to hang up on her.]

00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.240
[I'm telling you,]

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.800
[Lu Xinying]

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.160
[was a total good girl growing up.]

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:03.720
[She's under]

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:04.840
[her mom's thumb.]

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.520
[She must've been so bottled up]

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.040
[that now she's flipped,]

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.200
[got a mind of her own about everything.]

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.920
[What's ridiculous]

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.800
[is that I take her kid in,]

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:16.560
[she accuses me]

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.640
[of scamming.]

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.480
[I can't believe her.]

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000
[Nobody gets to spend their whole life]

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.200
[doing only what they like,]

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:12.240
[right?]

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.720
Fed the pigeons?

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:32.400
Yeah.

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.760
I know

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.040
what I'm doing.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.000
Everyone

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:41.880
reaches this day sooner or later.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.240
Are you scared?

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.480
There's nothing scary about death.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.720
It's just taking off an old coat.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.000
You think I've drifted off to sleep,

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.160
but maybe

00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:58.880
I'm just waking up

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.080
from a long dream.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.280
The Ivy League program you promised

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.600
is nothing like what you advertised.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.560
What kind of junk schools

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:17.880
are these you're recommending?

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.960
What kind of scam agency are you,

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.760
cheating your clients like this?

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.000
The manager's not here, huh?

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:24.720
Fine.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.240
I'll see if anyone

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:27.520
will deal with this.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:28.840
Please, calm down.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:29.640
Have some water.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.880
You can talk to me.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:31.920
I'm the person in charge here.

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:32.880
You can

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.440
tell me anything.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.200
I've gone through Wu Jinxuan's file...

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:35.600
[Ge Kaiyang.]

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.360
Today the full-service funeral guys

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.000
gave me a form and asked me

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.720
to fill in my grandma's life story.

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.240
I realized I don't know

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.040
the first thing about her life,

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.280
like when she went to school,

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.960
worked, met my grandpa,

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.160
got married,

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.520
or had my dad...

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:50.960
All I've ever known

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:54.680
is that

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.040
she's my grandma.

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:03.680
I feel like

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.040
I'm the jinx of this family.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.239
I keep thinking...

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:14.920
if I died,

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.199
what would happen to my family?

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:19.520
Don't talk nonsense.

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.320
Everyone dies.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.960
If I were to die right now,

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:30.440
what would be written on this form?

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:33.960
And who'd even

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.120
fill it out?

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:43.239
You still have me.

00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:56.360
Thanks.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:03.360
It was really hard finding a photo

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:04.480
of my grandma this time.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:08.080
She didn't have a single

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:08.880
proper picture.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.200
Why don't you take one of me?

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.440
Maybe when I die they can use it.

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:26.920
Now?

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.160
Yes.

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.040
Let me check.

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.360
Not great.

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:05.560
300 yuan.

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:09.640
My condolences.

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:10.400
Thank you.

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:16.680
200 yuan.

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:19.800
My condolences.

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:29.920
Dear family and friends,

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:33.600
today we gather

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.280
with very heavy hearts

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:36.880
to mourn the passing

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:38.720
of my grandmother,

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.720
Ms. Huang Shufen.

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.720
My grandma was born

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:44.800
on November 8th, 1946,

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.120
and passed away

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.000
on the morning of July 14th, 2023

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.360
at Lucheng First Hospital,

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:51.160
at the age of 78.

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.320
She's devoted to her work,

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:55.360
and spent 20 years as a textile worker

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.240
at Lucheng No. 3 Handkerchief Factory.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:01.600
Sorry

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.000
to take up a bit of your time.

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:06.280
And now,

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.360
here's what I want to say to her.

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:13.320
[Huang Shufen,]

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.280
[the truth is, I never really]

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.240
[understood your life.]

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:20.440
[It's only after you left]

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.760
[that I started to truly get to know you.]

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.440
[When I lived at your place,]

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.880
[I could hear your laughter]

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.400
[from far down the street.]

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:29.920
[I don't know when it changed,]

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.440
[but at some point]

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.360
[you stopped laughing so much.]

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:37.360
[Maybe it's after Grandpa passed,]

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:39.600
[or because you're always]

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.080
[worried about my parents,]

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.120
[or because I went overseas.]

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.520
[I remember you once told me,]

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:50.320
[that everyone]

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.040
[has relationships that drift apart.]

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.120
[But they're never]

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.920
[as broken as we imagine.]

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.320
[Or perhaps,]

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.040
[it's because before they faded,]

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.320
[they shone.]

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:04.720
[They were real and solid,]

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:05.760
[and for a time, they lit up our world.]

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:08.720
[We all walk]

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.240
[alongside different people.]

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.320
[Even if]

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:13.720
[we're not together now...]

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:15.720
[that's okay.]

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.160
[To me, you've only left. ]

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.240
[You haven't disappeared.]

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.520
[You became a part of me.]

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:39.800
[But it wasn't until this visit,]

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:41.480
[after I returned,]

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.560
[that I truly saw you—]

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.440
[really saw]

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:47.920
[how much we look alike.]

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:50.920
[Your brows arch like little moons,]

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:53.560
[your lashes are long,]

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.320
[your eyes are bright,]

00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:58.560
[your nose is tall.]

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.480
[And your smile]

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.280
[is truly beautiful.]

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:05.920
[I've grown up now.]

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.520
[So please, don't worry about me.]

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:12.200
[There's a line from a book I recall:]

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.400
["We come from nowhere,"]

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.400
["and to nowhere we return."]

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:20.000
[May your journey be peaceful.]

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:42.720
[When I'm gone,]

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.840
[keep it as simple as you can.]

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.360
[Don't trouble]

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:49.480
[your uncles and aunties too much,]

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.080
[and don't blame them.]

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:53.400
[Everything]

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:55.080
[has its cause and its result.]

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.200
They've always complained that

00:41:58.200 --> 00:41:59.880
your grandpa and I played favorites.

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:01.400
I know that.

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.520
But that's grown-up business.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.000
You stay out of it.

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:07.080
From now on,

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.360
just live

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:10.480
your own life well.

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.040
Promise me.

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.360
Got it.

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.160
Why are you so fat though?

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.280
How dare you.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:28.400
I'm leaving those pigeons in your care.

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:31.000
I love eating pigeons.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:32.840
I'll remember that.

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:35.080
I hold grudges.

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:55.680
[Everyone]

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.440
[reaches this day sooner or later.]

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:00.960
[Are you scared?]

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.120
[There's nothing scary about death.]

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:07.480
[It's just taking off an old coat.]

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:10.600
[You think I've drifted off to sleep,]

00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:12.840
[but maybe]

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:14.560
[I'm just waking up]

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:16.680
[from a long dream.]

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.320
[Huang Shufen,]

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.240
[thanks for making me in your dream.]

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:24.920
[It's time I woke up too.]

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:32.720
[My name is Ge Kaiyang,]

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:36.560
I'm 27 years old.

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.880
Nice to meet you, Ge Kaiyang.

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.080
My father

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:46.560
has called me useless since childhood.

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:54.720
[Everything is dust in the wind,]

00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:57.560
[everything vanishes without a trace.]

00:43:58.560 --> 00:43:59.960
[In this world of chaos,]

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:02.200
[where do I belong?]

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.880
Where am I meant to go?

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:07.120
But what if a person's entire life

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.840
is mapped out from the moment

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:10.360
they're born?

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:13.040
[Which grade school to attend,]

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.720
[which high school,]

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:16.920
[when to go abroad,]

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.400
[when to return,]

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:20.040
[which company to join,]

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:22.160
[which hospital when ill,]

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.760
[which grave to rest in...]

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:27.160
[Would that drive them mad?]
