Your future lies with Cheongjae Foundation.

00:14:07.067 --> 00:14:10.143
If we let Hee Kwon play his games,

00:14:10.167 --> 00:14:12.700
our foundation will be in danger.

00:14:14.433 --> 00:14:17.543
I might not seem important now,

00:14:17.567 --> 00:14:20.109
but I'll get my position soon.

00:14:20.133 --> 00:14:22.267

I don't know how to do it.

Actually, that's why I came.

00:14:44.433 --> 00:14:46.776
You definitely

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.133
need to do something for me.

You're cold, aren't you?

00:15:03.833 --> 00:15:05.843
No, not at all.

00:15:05.867 --> 00:15:07.509
Let's get in the car, it's cold.

Don't you?

00:15:29.367 --> 00:15:34.167
Is it because you're pretty?
Or because you're kind?

Even if I disappoint you,

00:15:55.033 --> 00:15:56.943
will you still

00:15:56.967 --> 00:15:59.867
take my side unconditionally?

00:16:05.333 --> 00:16:07.467
No matter

00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:12.943
where you go or what you do,

00:16:12.967 --> 00:16:15.067
no matter what you did,

00:16:15.867 --> 00:16:18.267
I will always be on your side.

Wow!

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:56.409
My daughter looks
exceptionally pretty today.

00:16:56.433 --> 00:17:00.633
Jenna, you should accept the flowers.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.843
You're all grown up now.

00:17:05.867 --> 00:17:06.976
Remember this,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.509
today is meaningful for you,

Remember that.

Yes, Dad.

00:17:21.867 --> 00:17:23.376
Don't worry.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.576
Shall we go find our seats?

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:26.909
You go first.

00:17:26.933 --> 00:17:30.233
I need to talk with my stepmom.

00:17:34.055 --> 00:17:38.321
Alright, you two talk then.

I was wrong.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.476

You really didn't know?

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.243
By the way, Madam,

00:26:31.267 --> 00:26:34.143
how are you so elegant?

00:26:34.167 --> 00:26:35.709
Thank you.

00:26:35.733 --> 00:26:37.343
Nice to meet you.

00:26:37.367 --> 00:26:39.733
I'm Ha Min Hee.

00:26:40.667 --> 00:26:43.143
You're here, Chairman?

00:26:43.167 --> 00:26:45.667
Mr. Chairman, you're here.

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.443
Please take your seat.

00:26:48.467 --> 00:26:50.867
- Please sit.
- Yes.

00:26:59.633 --> 00:27:01.909
Allow me to announce

00:27:01.933 --> 00:27:04.076
the ceremony will begin shortly.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.567
Please, return to your seats.

00:27:16.933 --> 00:27:18.509
Yes, despite your busy schedules,

00:27:18.533 --> 00:27:21.709
we express our gratitude to all of you

00:27:21.733 --> 00:27:23.943
who took precious time to celebrate

00:27:23.967 --> 00:27:26.176
the beautiful engagement of the two.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.609
Today is not merely a day...

00:27:27.633 --> 00:27:28.809
What is this?

00:27:28.833 --> 00:27:30.876
When two people promise
their future together,

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:34.176
but also a meaningful occasion

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.709
where two families unite as one.

00:27:36.733 --> 00:27:38.543
Yes, the protagonists are none other than.

00:27:38.567 --> 00:27:43.509
Hanmyeong Group's Baek Jenna
and Chasel Medic's Cha Jin Wook.

00:27:43.533 --> 00:27:48.967
Please welcome them with a big applause.

00:27:53.733 --> 00:27:56.509
Yes, the two are so beautiful and splendid,

00:27:56.533 --> 00:27:58.909
making their entrance together now.

00:27:58.933 --> 00:28:02.200
Let's have another round
of enthusiastic applause!

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.643
Now, we shall formally

00:28:09.667 --> 00:28:12.309
commence the engagement ceremony.

00:28:12.333 --> 00:28:15.967
First, we'll hear congratulatory remarks,

00:28:17.133 --> 00:28:19.076
expressing hopes for
the couple's shared future.

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:22.409
Through Hanmyeong Scholarship
Foundation's Equal Opportunity System,

00:28:22.433 --> 00:28:24.943
she entered Cheongdam
International High School.

00:28:24.967 --> 00:28:26.909
Baek Jenna's friend,

00:28:26.933 --> 00:28:28.643
- Friend?
- Student Kim Hye In.

00:28:28.667 --> 00:28:31.933
- This is bullshit.
- Please give her a big applause.

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.209
Hello everyone.

00:28:56.233 --> 00:28:59.909
I'm here to celebrate
my friends' engagement

00:28:59.933 --> 00:29:04.667
as student representative
of Cheongdam International High School.

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.076
I transferred to this school

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:19.433
through the Equal Opportunity System.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:37.643
Hey!

00:29:37.667 --> 00:29:39.076
Hey, Seo Hee Su!

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.033
Seo Hee Su!

00:29:42.267 --> 00:29:44.409
What's happening?

00:29:44.433 --> 00:29:47.209
Haven't seen you in
ages. Can't you calm down?

00:29:47.233 --> 00:29:49.043
Even if we cut ties...

00:29:49.067 --> 00:29:50.609
Ah, darn it!

00:29:50.633 --> 00:29:52.833
What the hell!

00:29:53.567 --> 00:29:55.667
They'll hear everything.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:57.943
Let's talk somewhere else.

00:29:57.967 --> 00:29:59.409
Darn it.

00:29:59.433 --> 00:30:02.133
I said let's go talk elsewhere!

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.409
The truth is,

00:30:35.433 --> 00:30:37.909
as a transfer student
from a regular school,

00:30:37.933 --> 00:30:41.709
the reason I could enter
Cheongdam International High School

00:30:41.733 --> 00:30:45.743
is because Kim Hae In,

00:30:45.767 --> 00:30:48.009
the original Equal Opportunity student

00:30:48.033 --> 00:30:51.133
who tried to commit suicide
jumping from the rooftop.

00:30:52.867 --> 00:30:54.776
But on that day,

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.733
when Kim Hae In fell from the roof,

00:30:58.367 --> 00:31:03.067
I was also present.

00:31:04.933 --> 00:31:06.809
And at that moment,

00:31:06.833 --> 00:31:10.033
I saw the person who pushed Kim Hae In.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.143
I was allowed

00:31:16.167 --> 00:31:20.109
to enter this school under the condition

00:31:20.133 --> 00:31:23.543
that I stay silent about
the culprit who pushed her.

00:31:23.567 --> 00:31:27.543
And within Cheongdam
International High School's.

00:31:27.567 --> 00:31:29.109
Diamond 6,

00:31:29.133 --> 00:31:31.409
there is a murderer

00:31:31.433 --> 00:31:33.733
who tried to kill Kim
Hae In by pushing her.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.767
The culprit who pushed
Kim Hae In is present today!

00:31:43.233 --> 00:31:44.609
That criminal is none other than

00:31:44.633 --> 00:31:47.133
a member of Diamond 6...
