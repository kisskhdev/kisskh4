00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.100
And just like that, it was Monday morning.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.000
Honestly, I don't feel the slightest bit
ashamed about my own sexual orientation.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.500
I just don't want this to make
things awkward for anyone else.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.200
Got some sauce on it.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.300
What should we do next?

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.800
Ocean Park...

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.300
Not bad!

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.500
I'm really looking
forward to next Saturday.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.500
Ocean Park.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.899
- Are you someone who doesn't cook?
- No, I can cook.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.600
What a surprise, that's pretty good!

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.180
Because I was the one who grabbed it.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.200
Looks a lot alike.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.200
Oh no!

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.800
Safe travels!

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.300
Good morning.

00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:28.409
Ah! Good morning.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.709
The weather is really nice today.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.710
- I'm heading out now.
- Be careful on the road!

00:02:30.711 --> 00:02:34.800
It feels like you're really
shining, Suzume-chan.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.300
Shining bright! Shining bright!

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.300
What kind of expression
should I have when I see him?

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.800
Alright.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.700
Sorry for being rude.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.990
- Tojo-san.
- Yes.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.399
N Company said they want to
move the project up by a month.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.710
Huh?

00:03:13.711 --> 00:03:15.080
I just got the notification.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.200
I'm heading over to N Company now to get
more details. I'll discuss it with you later.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.850
Got it.

00:03:19.851 --> 00:03:22.229
I'll keep my phone on. Contact
me right away if anything comes up.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.500
Alright, I'm heading out.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.130
Tojo-san, this is bad!

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.229
The promotional venue at K
Company is no longer available.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.080
What's going on?

00:03:29.081 --> 00:03:30.300
There was a fire.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.199
This morning's news.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.800
Have you contacted K Company?

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.506
I tried calling the person in charge at K
Company, but I haven't been able to get through.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.499
Wait a little while and
try calling again later.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.399
Also, look for an alternative
venue while you're at it.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.400
Okay.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.569
- Hello, Ms. Udagawa?
- Oh, sorry about that.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.999
I'm in the ambulance right now.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.369
Huh? An ambulance?

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.110
Yeah, I fell down the
stairs at the station.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.969
Are you okay?

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.210
Hmm... The sprain is a bit serious, but just to
be safe, I'll need to get my head checked as well.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.320
You really need to get a thorough checkup.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.369
Take it easy and get some rest today. Let
the doctor give you a thorough check-up.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.000
- Yeah, alright.
- Mr. Yoshizawa, Mr. Yoshizawa!

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.499
- What's going on here? This is way too chaotic.
- How about the Garden Hall or Marunouchi Center?

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.020
Where can you even book it right now?!

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.999
There's just no time at all...

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.200
Suzume!

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.429
I'd like to ask you to
take on that new case.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.800
Could you help send some extra people over…

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Nothing?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.700
Nothing...

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.300
There's just no time to
think about anything extra.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.500
"10 Things I Want to Do Before I Turn 40"
(Episode 3)

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.399
(Ocean Park)

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.300
(Ocean Park)

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.560
Give it a little more effort!

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.500
I'm seriously getting numb.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.900
We've got time, we've
got time, we've got time!

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.799
Tojo-san, we're really running out of time.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.879
I'll figure out the timing
on my end, don't worry.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.500
Sorry, I'm counting on you.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.400
This...

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.600
All set.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.700
My brain just can't handle this at all...

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.969
Ah! Tojo-san!

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:46.970
Huh?

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.800
We're out of budget.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.020
Then let's cancel the bubble machine
and balloons for the event for now.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.100
Got it, I'll try to take care of it.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.700
I really can't do it anymore...

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.300
No way~

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.000
Suzume-chan.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.940
Two days left until we go to
the Ocean Park on Saturday.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.600
Only two days left!

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.400
- Ocean Park…
- Yeah!

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.590
Now it all depends on
how K Corporation decides.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:26.999
I'll do my best to negotiate.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.700
Thanks for your help.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.016
Thanks to your help, things
are finally starting to take shape.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.379
Alright, if anything comes up, I'll contact
you right away. Thank you so much.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.500
I'll be taking my leave now.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.240
Suzume!

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.800
This isn't good!

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:39.700
What happened now?!

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.060
Look...

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.000
What is this…

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.380
This thing is completely ruined.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:50.600
This too?

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.200
I haven't felt this tired in a long time...

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.800
Sorry, Susuko.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.000
It's tough, isn't it?

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.000
All I do every day is go to
work and then go home...

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.800
How about meeting at
Ocean Park at 11 on Saturday?

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.400
It's not just about work.
I need to give it my all here, too.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.000
Hang in there a little longer, Suzume-chan.
Saturday's almost here.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.749
Alright, about that matter.
If you can get back to me by the end of today, that'll be fine.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.000
No problem, thank you.

00:09:21.084 --> 00:09:24.200
Being able to handle such a heavy
workload without even breaking a sweat...

00:09:24.241 --> 00:09:25.771
Truly impressive. I have
so much respect for that.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.119
Alright, thank you.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.200
Sorry for the interruption.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:30.900
Hey, this is Mr. Shitajo.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.799
Yes, that's right.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.000
Regarding the promotion of the new product.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.600
Is it okay to finalize the
plan on that side like this?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.300
Ah! It's over.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.500
Tomorrow...

00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.400
Huh?

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.500
What on earth should I wear?

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.200
Sorry to keep you waiting...

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.299
Alright... good job.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.799
You just want to say it
looks really tacky, right?

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:45.550
Just say it straight out.

00:10:45.551 --> 00:10:46.599
Yeah, it's really tacky.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.200
Don't be so blunt about it.

00:10:49.808 --> 00:10:51.508
You look just like a dad on vacation.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.000
Is it really that bad?

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.800
Don't just stay silent.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.600
Then let's go.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.120
Don't turn around and laugh!

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.200
No, no.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:09.800
Speaking of which.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.720
Why did you choose Hakkeijima Sea Paradise?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.119
No, it's just that I've never
been to the aquarium before.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.399
- Oh, really?
- Hmm...

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.500
I was thinking, since it's for work, I
should at least come and check it out once.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.800
Workaholic.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.500
I accidentally lied...

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.779
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Here's your Sparrow Baby crepe.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:37.800
Thank you.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.600
It's seriously adorable.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.869
Excuse me, I'd like to
order a Sparrow Baby crepe.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:47.870
Okay.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.800
Tojo-san.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.300
Hold on a second.

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.110
- Hm?
- Could you take a look at this for me?

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.000
Ah! No...

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.400
Here you go, please enjoy.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.599
No... I don't really feel like eating.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.699
What are you being so polite about?

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.500
Isn't today exactly one of those days?

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.000
Tojo-san, you really like
dreamy things, don't you?

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.200
No, not really.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.500
You can tell just by looking at that room.
It's way too obvious.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.100
Just eat it.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.360
Stop filming already!

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.200
Come on, come on! Look over here!

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.150
Not bad!

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:58.570
Where should I start eating this?

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:00.420
Should we start from the top?

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.300
You... why are you like this!

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.000
Of course! Where else
would you start eating it from?

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.100
Here?

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.276
- I said stop filming already.
- Alright, alright.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.890
Suzume-chan and the sparrow.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.800
That's way too old-fashioned.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:13.700
Here we go!

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.899
Ah! It's at the highest point!

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:17.900
Oh no!

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.600
That's amazing!

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.130
- Okay.
- Ah! That was amazing.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:22.376
Wow, that's amazing, really amazing!

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.480
- Keiishi! Stop pretending to pedal.
- I really am pedaling, I really am! Look.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.369
Why am I the only one sitting here?

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.000
Riding solo~

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.800
Stop filming!

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.749
Next round, next round!

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:44.750
Lock in! Lock in!

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.430
- So cute!
- Actually, that's pretty impressive, isn't it?

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.110
Why am I the only one left?

00:13:52.111 --> 00:13:54.600
- Finally made it to the end…
- That was seriously so much fun.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:56.500
So big!

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.949
It's even bigger than I expected.

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:01.010
That's amazing!

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:02.290
Let's take a picture.

00:14:02.291 --> 00:14:03.779
Hey, take the shot over here!

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.400
Hurry, take the shot!

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.200
- Oh! This could turn out to be an amazing photo.
- Really!

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.090
Wow, that's amazing!

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:10.730
That's incredible!

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:11.500
That's really impressive.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:11.750
Hey.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:12.650
Wow, that's amazing!

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:12.900
Hey.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:13.190
Huh?

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:14.190
There's some over here too!

00:14:14.191 --> 00:14:15.751
Wow, that's amazing, really impressive!

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:46.179
We can buy the souvenirs later, right?

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.700
Yeah.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:51.980
Do you want to go in and take a look?

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.000
Just for a moment.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.100
Yeah.

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.500
Wow!

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.000
So white!

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.970
It's so soft and fluffy!

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:04.600
Wow!

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.000
Aren't you going to buy it?

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.480
It's okay, really, you don't have to.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.800
Tojo-san really can't bring
himself to spend money on himself.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.199
Ah! Tojo-san!

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.200
Huh?

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.409
This is the one I won
from the arcade before.

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:29.089
Ah! Are they from the same series?

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:31.330
Oh, I didn't realize there
were so many different kinds.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:38.700
At the time, I grabbed it because I thought
this guy really looked like Tojo-san.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:43.600
So strong!

00:15:43.601 --> 00:15:45.000
That's amazing!

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.800
That's amazing!

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:51.000
Wow! You really got it with just one coin!

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.599
That was amazing, but
honestly, it was a little boring too.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.000
Shut up!

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.200
Tojo-san.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.300
Here you go.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.799
Huh, for me?!

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.300
Because it's a sparrow.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.000
As I thought, for me...

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.800
This one is the cutest.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.800
I'll just buy one to take home.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:31.100
So... how about this one with glasses?

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:32.700
Feels a lot like me.

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:34.500
What kind of reason is that?

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.000
I'll buy it.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.300
No... no need, it's okay!

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.600
I want to do this.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.500
As a memento of today.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.700
I'm counting on you.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.500
Thank you.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.630
Wow, it really is so smooth and silky!

00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:17.200
Is this your first time trying it?

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.300
I've always wanted to try it.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.200
For real?

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.800
This trend has been around for a while now.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:30.000
It does feel a bit weird for
an old man to go buy it.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.600
I don't think there's
anything wrong with it.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.320
If you like something, just like it.
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:41.800
Let me have a sip.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.580
Mm! So sweet!

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.200
Kazama is really strong!

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.300
It feels great to have plans lined up.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.200
What?

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:15.080
After all, isn't this week super busy?

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.180
Yeah.

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:21.900
But just thinking about having
plans for the weekend makes me feel.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.300
Alright, I'm going to hang in there!

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.500
Thanks!

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
I had an amazing time today.

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.020
It's okay even if it's just on a whim.

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.489
This rain is just insane!

00:18:58.490 --> 00:18:59.849
Tojo-san, there's a spot over there
where we can take shelter from the rain!

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:00.400
Over there?

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.400
Yeah.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.000
It's coming down so hard...

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:15.500
All soaked...

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Here, this is for you.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.260
Wipe yourself off quickly.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:21.260
Ah! Sorry about that.

00:19:29.391 --> 00:19:32.291
It's the first time I've seen
him without his glasses.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.500
Tojo-san, you're soaked too, aren't you?

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.320
No, I'm really fine.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.520
Is that so?

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.400
I can't see very clearly.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:47.420
Is your eyesight really that bad?

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:48.800
Yeah.

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:50.939
Once I take off my
glasses, I can't see a thing.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.900
That's actually why I
gave up on volleyball, too…

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.800
Ah! I see it now.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:07.800
Hey, Tojo-san.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.200
I'm not just acting on a whim.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.200
Your hair is all wet.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
I hope you can value
yourself a little more.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:17.500
Ah! Why is this rain still not letting up?

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.200
Kiss.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.300
I thought he was going to kiss me.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.800
Starting today, you two will...

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.800
Time to move!

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.500
There's still more on the list.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.200
Seven things.

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.300
I'm really looking forward to
what's next, Suzume-chan.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.300
What should I do with him next time?

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.549
(Next Episode Preview)
Let's make an amazing custom meal!

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:35.299
- He was a senior from the volleyball club back in college.
- It's been a long time.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.099
Consistently putting in the effort
every day really makes a difference.

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.990
No matter how hard I
try now, it's pointless.

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:43.700
If there's something you can't do alone,
just do it together with someone else.
