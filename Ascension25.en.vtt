When you killed those rogue cultivators,

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.780
did you ask for their names too?

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:11.730
Come out!

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.370
Come out!

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:19.490
Come out!

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:29.490
Han,

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.220
is he insane?

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.850
He's consumed by obsession.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:35.490
Come out!

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:36.340
Han's array

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:37.610
is truly incredible!

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:38.730
From now on,

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.770
I'll never dare cross him again.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:44.220
But this array can only hold him for a while.

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:46.370
We'll still need a talisman to finish him off.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.180
What's he trying to do now?

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:24.820
I didn't expect

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.490
you'd force me to use this.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:48.580
Han,

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:49.700
let's take him down together!

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.860
Didn't think you can use a talisman this recklessly.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:46.420
Han,

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:47.730
you really don't hold back.

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:49.530
It's not like I want to.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.140
The sect never covers my costs anyway.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.140
He should've been turned to dust.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.620
So why can I still sense his aura in the array?

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:05.940
Never thought your array would have

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.530
such rich elemental diversity!

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:13.220
It actually helped me find a breakthrough.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.810
As long as I can regenerate with blood,

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.940
as long as my soul remains,

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.660
you'll never be able to kill me!

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.250
This is the perfect place

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.140
to refine my power

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.180
and forge a baleful core!

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:30.810
Later,

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:34.010
I'll kill you!

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.180
That fiend

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.290
is terrifying.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:38.900
He's even turned Han's array to his advantage.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:40.810
If we don't end him here and now,

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.010
he'll become a disaster.

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:44.290
All right, Han.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.460
I'll take it from here.

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:50.140
Weiniang,

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:50.940
no!

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:52.180
That was left to you by Jing.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:52.980
Weiniang,

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.010
did you already activate it just now?

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:56.770
This talisman

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.220
and the one from Senior Liu

00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:59.250
are a matching pair.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.220
Sharp eyes, Han.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.620
They're called Phoenix Talismans.

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:07.770
Both were forged from the same treasure.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.140
Jing got it back in the day,

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:13.940
and gave one to me.

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:41.620
That fiend can regenerate from blood.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:42.810
He's nearly impossible to kill.

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:44.860
If we don't burn him to ashes,

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.860
there's no other way!

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.380
Han,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.010
please,

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.010
open the array!

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.010
Weiniang...

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.700
No way...

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:11.330
I'm not ready to let go!

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.250
Jing, look.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.570
Even this fiend's blood

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.380
can burn so beautifully.

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:56.010
These are the Blood Condensing Five-Element Pills

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:58.180
he sacrificed everything to obtain.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.730
There are also this hidden weapon that wounded me,

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.090
and all these treasures.

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:05.050
Even after repeated blasts from talismans,

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:06.620
they're still intact.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:07.980
Clearly,

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:09.530
none of them is ordinary.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:18.810
Han,

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:22.730
I've already informed the sect.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.900
The Discipline Hall

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.330
will take over the aftermath.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.380
As for Emperor Yue's involvement,

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.220
they'll likely make up

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.380
a cover story.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:32.460
Everything

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:34.660
will return to how it was.

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:48.050
One more thing.

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:50.220
Just now,

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:53.730
in a hidden chamber where the emperor was hiding,

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:56.770
we found Wu Xuan's body.

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:04.770
Judging

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:06.900
by the looks of it,

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.860
he must've suffered immensely.

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:38.860
Oh,

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:40.250
Han,

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.090
we found this book

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:46.380
in that fiend's place as well.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.490
In this battle,

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:50.700
you saved me, Weiniang,

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.940
and Chen.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:53.290
I thought about it,

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.730
and I think it should be yours to deal with.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:58.570
The techniques in here

00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.460
are dark and twisted.

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:01.570
[Mystic Yin Art]
You may study a little,

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:03.810
but don't ever fall into its path.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.530
Demonic Transformation,

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:12.980
Blood Condensing Five-Element Pills

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.050
and the Avatar technique...

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:16.570
So...

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.940
this is where the Black Fiend Cult's powers come from.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.220
Thank you, Senior.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.180
As for this book,

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.330
I will destroy it in due time.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.490
I won't let its poison spread.

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:34.220
Our Master once said,

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.010
no technique is inherently good or evil.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:39.660
Good or evil lies in the heart.

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:43.010
Don't worry, Senior.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:46.330
All right.

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.730
Let's go.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:52.980
Time to head back.

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:13.940
[Blissful Union]

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.220
[Blissful Union]

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.810
Senior Chen has set off to report back to her clan.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:55.530
After this battle,

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.490
the always-cheerful her

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.220
fell into silence.

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:01.330
Senior Zhong

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:03.700
will escort Senior Liu's relics home.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.700
Naturally, Senior Song went with her.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:08.980
In just a few days,

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:10.770
everything changed.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.220
If the Seven Sects

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.420
make it through this crisis,

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.380
we'll reunite

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:18.380
at Yellow Maple Valley again.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.490
Every time I close my eyes now,

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:25.050
I see Jing's face.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.010
I grew up with him.

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:30.220
I still can't believe

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:32.730
he's gone.

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:34.940
He once told me

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:37.380
you're the young master of the Song family,

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:40.730
and he was just an orphan.

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:43.330
Yet you always treated him so well.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.140
Young master?

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.290
Without him,

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:50.980
I wouldn't even be alive.

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.010
What "young master"...

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:56.940
Jing once saved your life?

00:28:59.310 --> 00:28:59.810
Back then,

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.940
a dark cultivator snuck into our family,

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.250
pretending to be the accountant.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.860
He discovered that my senior and I had spirit roots.

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:08.900
He wanted to use us in his experiments.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:10.700
If not for him,

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.730
I'd have been...

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:14.620
- Hold still! - ...the monster's lab rat.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.010
You bit me?

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.530
Drink it!

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.810
Drink it!

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.180
Now!

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.180
Let's run!

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:35.140
Ever since that day,

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:37.050
his body's been damaged.

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.090
He could never reach Core Formation Stage.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:41.490
What?

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:43.860
So that's why

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:45.570
he hated demonic cultivators.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.730
He never told me any of this.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.660
Of course he wouldn't.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.220
He always wanted to leave you

00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:57.290
with only the best memories.

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:01.530
Fool...

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:26.330
I wish I could hear those words from you myself.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:31.900
Weiniang.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:33.330
Don't be sad.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:36.090
Let's take Jing home together.

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.090
I'm sure he misses home too.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.220
Every cloud has a silver lining.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:06.770
The battle

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.050
cost me dearly,

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:09.530
but I broke through

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.010
because of it too.

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:14.010
I've reached the Late Foundation Stage.

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:15.860
I also happened to unravel

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:17.570
the secrets within the Mystic Yin Art.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:21.330
Turns out

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:23.140
this technique

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.140
didn't originate from the Tiannan Continent.

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:26.700
It's incredibly sinister.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:28.460
Thankfully,

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.220
I didn't recklessly take the Blood Condensing Five-Element Pills.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.620
This pill feeds on the blood aura

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:35.570
of fiend Foundation Establishment cultivators.

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:38.490
No wonder Emperor Yue gave it to them.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:40.380
Those five

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.010
likely died without ever knowing

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:43.290
they were just

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.860
the emperor's living incubators.

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:54.250
Though it boasts

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.490
a 30% chance of forming a core,

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:58.380
the resulting baleful core

00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:59.730
is a false one.

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:01.700
Not only does it block future breakthroughs,

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.770
but it's corroded by blood aura,

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:04.980
turning the user into a beast.

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:07.050
If you lose your humanity,

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.140
what's the point of living forever?

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:10.940
Still,

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.940
the Avatar technique

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.330
recorded in the book

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.330
may be worth studying.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:33.530
What's this new spell?

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:34.490
It's quite interesting.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.250
You brat!

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.220
I told you to keep an eye on the Qin family.

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:42.380
And you went and made a mess like this?

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:44.620
Listen up.

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:47.180
The frontlines are in total chaos these days.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.180
Don't come over.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:49.050
Stay out of it.

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:51.770
Get back to Yellow Maple Valley

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:53.180
and reflect on your mistakes!

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:55.700
When I return,

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.940
explain properly to me!

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:00.330
He's off?

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.050
You were right.

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:05.140
Steward Wang

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.620
really hid piles of gold and silver.

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:08.010
Caihuan found it all

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.770
and handed it out to the poor in the city.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.140
But Caihuan said,

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.810
those artifacts and talismans

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:14.530
should be handled by you instead.

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:15.810
Looks like

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:18.660
they were taken from rogue cultivators.

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.700
Who knows

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:22.180
how many

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:24.050
were just like Xiaoshan?

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:30.700
Miss Mo is so thoughtful.

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.290
Where is she?

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:34.700
Why didn't she come with you?

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.010
Well,

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:38.010
one of the rogue cultivators we rescued

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:39.420
was severely injured.

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:40.380
She died giving birth

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.330
and left behind a premature baby girl.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.490
Strangest thing,

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:45.900
she cries whenever she sees me,

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:46.810
no matter how I coax her.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.940
But once she's in Caihuan's arms, she calms right down.

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:51.490
That's just how she is.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:53.220
All these years,

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:54.530
she's never changed.

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:58.660
Caihuan is busy looking after Yingning.

00:33:58.830 --> 00:33:59.660
No time to come say hi.

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:03.900
Yingning's the baby girl.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:04.900
Her mother's surname was Li.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.290
Looks like she'll be raised by Caihuan.

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.180
You've done a lot this time.

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:21.220
Go on,

00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:22.420
what reward do you want?

00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:24.730
There really is a reward?

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:26.380
I can ask for anything?

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:28.330
You'll agree to anything I say?

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:31.700
Come on, tell me.

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:32.810
Do you want pills,

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:33.330
artifacts,

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:34.330
or advanced talismans?

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:39.530
Then what do you want?

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:41.900
I want to become your disciple!

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:42.700
Master,

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:43.810
please accept my respect!

00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:47.730
Don't kneel.

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:49.290
You can speak to me

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:50.490
standing up.

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:51.940
Stand up and speak properly.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.050
Li, do you think I'm not talented enough?

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:01.980
I know I'm reckless and hot-headed,

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:02.730
and way too full of myself.

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:03.530
I'm not like those elite disciples

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:04.700
from the Seven Sects.

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:05.980
But I really, truly, want

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:06.940
to learn from you.

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.010
I swear I'll never be rude to you again.

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:10.900
I'll massage your shoulders, serve you tea!

This girl's really persistent.

All right,

if you keep going like this,

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:27.980
you'll lose all your rewards, I promise.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:29.530
As for me,

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:30.530
I never planned on taking a disciple.

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:31.730
But I do have something

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:32.730

But those filthy gossips in the manor

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:55.170
are saying you got driven out of the capital.

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:57.300
But I know that's not true.

00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:58.820
I saw it myself

Such generosity

is far beyond any man.

you're no ordinary man.

When I heard you were leaving,

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:13.300
I had my wife cook

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:50.340
steamed deer tail,

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:51.980
roasted duck, roasted chick, roasted goose,

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:53.260
braised dishes, marinated duck, soy chicken, smoked meats,

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.650
preserved belly, dried sausages...

00:40:58.960 --> 00:40:59.940
I'm not here to eat.

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:01.820
Ah, I see.

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:03.740
You must be here for information.

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:04.940
Sir,

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:05.690
ask away.

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:06.570
In this whole area,

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.380
there's nothing I don't know.

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.650
Go ahead. Ask!

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.820
There's no secret in Jiayuan City

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:12.490
that I don't know!

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:14.420
Just like old times.

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:16.900
I heard the Mo Residence was taken over

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:18.420
by the Five-Color Sect.

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.780
Jiayuan City

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.460
hasn't had the Mo family in ages.

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:25.900
After their old master passed,

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:26.980
everything went downhill.

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.460
Then they crossed

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:29.860
the Five-Color Sect used to be allies,

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.010
and got wiped out overnight.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.650
It was brutal.

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:35.610
Later on,

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:37.010
the Five-Color Sect moved out entirely.

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.340
Said they pledged allegiance

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:39.340
to some bigwig in the capital.

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:41.010
Anyone from the Mo family still alive?

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.380
No one.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.650
Madam Mo and the household

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.900
were all slaughtered by those bastards.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:47.900
We neighbors

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:49.460
had to handle the aftermath

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.900
in secret.

00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:59.050
The dead deserve dignity.

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:00.380
You were righteous.

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:06.010
Waiter!

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:07.610
Coming!

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.050
What can I get you, sir?

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.740
Here, try this.

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.340
Enjoy, sir.

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:31.050
Sir,

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.940
this item looks

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.010
quite old.

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:35.340
Is there a story behind it?

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.130
Ah, I almost forgot.

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.650
I picked it up while helping collect remains

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:40.570
at the Mo Residence.

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.090
I had the appraiser take a look.

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:44.300
They said there's nothing special about it.

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:45.460
So we hung it up

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:46.490
like a wind bell.

00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:07.980
To be honest,

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.380
I had some ties with the Mo family back then.

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:12.650
But it's been years.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:14.210
Everything's changed.

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:19.820
Would you be willing

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:21.570
to part with this?

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:23.010
Just something to remember them by.

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:23.690
Sir,

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.260
I can't possibly charge you.

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:26.780
Back in the day, my friends and I

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:28.740
were often helped by the Mos.

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:29.460
And besides,

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:31.340
it's not worth anything anyway.

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:32.860
If you knew the Mo family,

00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:34.130
of course it should go to you.

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:36.010
How can I ask for payment?

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:37.900
But if you

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.010
really want to show appreciation,

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:40.780
how about

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:42.010
supporting my tavern?

00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:44.010
I'll whip up a few special dishes for you.

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:45.090
Just a moment, don't go!

00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.610
Sir!

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:00.980
I've prepared a few of our best dishes!

00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:03.050
Sir?

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:07.210
What's this?

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:09.610
This talisman

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:11.860
repels evil and clears the air.

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:13.460
Do not remove it.

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:16.130
Good people are always rewarded.

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.090
Remember.

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:19.690
Remember.

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:21.780
I'll remember.

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:22.940
I'll remember.

00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:27.570
No wonder he looked familiar.

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:29.260
I'd like

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:30.170
to ask something.

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:34.780
He stays youthful for decades.

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:38.380
I must've met an immortal!

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:44.340
From now on,

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:46.210
my tavern

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:48.980
will be called "Immortal's Blessing."

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.820
I'm renaming it to Immortal's Blessing,

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:52.610
you hear?

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.300
I met an immortal today!

00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:58.380
Sir...

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:00.130
From now on,

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:01.260
this place will be called

00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:04.090
Immortal's Blessing!

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:07.740
