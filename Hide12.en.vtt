00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.536
The dead body in the well

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.136
I think she was murdered by my father.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.584
It was not an accident.

00:00:12.864 --> 00:00:14.860
You killed Chat, didn’t you?

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.608
What are you talking about?

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.568
I asked

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.936
whether you were the one who killed Chat.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.056
(If this world is a competition, )

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.392
(the law must be the rule that sets the boundaries.)

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.030
Answer me.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.936
It wasn’t a hard question.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.856
You killed Chat, right?

00:00:43.888 --> 00:00:45.552
What do you mean?

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.270
There.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.144
That was you, Parn.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.320
And that night at the bar,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.576
the one who pretended to be Chat

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.288
and talked me into jumping off and killing myself,

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:03.376
that was you, right?

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.208
Why are you doing this?

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.240
Huh?

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.128
(The role of the players is to pretend)

00:01:13.992 --> 00:01:16.616
(that they’re playing by the rules.)

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
(But have a double cross prepared deep down.)

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.792
I was mistaken and thought

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:23.936
that Chat might still be alive.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.864
Now I understand.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.800
Everything happened because

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.888
someone has been pretending to be Chat.

00:01:29.928 --> 00:01:31.400
To fool me and my sisters.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.984
To play with our heads.

00:01:33.008 --> 00:01:34.768
And that person is you.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.552
Why would I do that?

00:01:37.584 --> 00:01:38.584
I love Chat.

00:01:38.608 --> 00:01:39.584
I love you guys like my real sisters.

00:01:39.616 --> 00:01:40.792
Come on!

00:01:40.832 --> 00:01:42.720
Stop being overoptimistic for once.

00:01:42.752 --> 00:01:44.384
I feel like throwing up.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.416
It’s fake right from when you said
Chat was a good person.

00:01:47.456 --> 00:01:48.352
You can be staring down from Pluto

00:01:48.376 --> 00:01:49.952
and still figure that it’s a pretense.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.992
Why would I lie to you guys?

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.696
Even when no one says it,

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.824
but everyone knows.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.768
That you’re the one

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.664
who probably hates us the most.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.536
(Because in this game, )

00:02:15.144 --> 00:02:17.576
(the one at fault might not be the loser.)

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.768
(But the winner)

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.696
(for faking it best in front of the judges.)

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.120
I’m here.

00:03:39.144 --> 00:03:40.144
Where are you?

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.512
Come on in.

00:03:41.528 --> 00:03:42.752
The innermost table.

00:03:42.784 --> 00:03:44.152
Come right in.

00:03:44.176 --> 00:03:45.904
The innermost table…

00:03:47.048 --> 00:03:48.608
Found it!

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.640
You look all pretty!

00:03:56.688 --> 00:03:58.144
I was casting for a series

00:03:58.168 --> 00:03:59.848
and came right after I finished.

00:03:59.888 --> 00:04:01.752
Happy birthday, Chom.

00:04:01.776 --> 00:04:02.776
Thank you.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.168
So how was it?

00:04:04.192 --> 00:04:05.536
What did they say?

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.264
They already told me the result.

00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:09.976
They said I got the job!

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.256
Then we have to celebrate.

00:04:12.288 --> 00:04:13.450
Come here.

00:04:13.488 --> 00:04:15.208
Bottoms up!

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.210
Bottoms up!

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.552
Because that night…

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.488
You were angry, right?

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.560
That we escaped,

00:04:26.592 --> 00:04:28.272
but you almost couldn’t make it out alive.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.136
Run, everyone!

00:04:51.168 --> 00:04:52.168
Run!

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.936
Chom!

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.808
Where did you guys go?

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.460
Chat!

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.248
I know

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.752
that you wanted to become an actress.

00:05:21.616 --> 00:05:23.976
You wanted to work in entertainment
like me or Chat.

00:05:27.696 --> 00:05:29.672
But because of the fire that night,

00:05:31.256 --> 00:05:33.260
it ruined your dreams.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.896
So you are bitter at us.

00:05:37.928 --> 00:05:39.192
Did I get it right?

00:05:43.328 --> 00:05:44.328
Do you

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.264
really think

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:48.472
I hate you because of that?

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.968
Even now, I can’t even go wherever I want.

00:05:56.008 --> 00:05:57.584
I can’t even do that!

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.056
So how would I have killed Chatfah?

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.960
How would I have done it?

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.048
You really can’t walk, right?

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:31.150
Yes.

00:06:39.736 --> 00:06:40.440
Chom!

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.544
What are you going to do?

00:06:41.576 --> 00:06:42.504
What are you doing to me?

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.264
Chom!

00:06:43.288 --> 00:06:44.304
Chom!

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.192
Chompoo, what are you doing?

00:06:47.224 --> 00:06:48.328
Chompoo!

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.360
Chompoo?

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.592
Chompoo, don’t do it!

00:06:52.616 --> 00:06:53.200
Chompoo!

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.240
Chompoo!

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.408
Chompoo, what are you about to do?

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.488
I’ll try it out and see

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.160
whether your legs really don’t work.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.296
Don’t do it!

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.168
Why did you do this to me?

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:35.968
That can’t be it.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.184
You must be the one who killed Chat.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.952
I didn’t kill her!

00:07:42.976 --> 00:07:44.980
I didn’t kill Chat.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.744
I love Chat.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.704
I love her so much.

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:54.592
Without her, I could have been dead.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:55.950
Wait!

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:56.672
What?

00:07:56.704 --> 00:07:58.056
Where is Parn?

00:07:58.104 --> 00:07:59.104
Parn?

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.984
She might have run away already.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.648
F*ck. Let’s go!

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.528
Hurry up, Chat!

00:08:04.552 --> 00:08:05.944
Hey, Chat!

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:06.960
Chat!

00:08:13.272 --> 00:08:14.272
Parn!

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:15.940
Parn!

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:18.270
Parn!

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.176
Parn, Parn, Parn!

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.440
Parn!

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.320
Parn!

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.760
I owe a lot to Chat.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.616
If Chat hadn’t gone back to save me that day,

00:08:45.664 --> 00:08:48.248
I wouldn’t have survived to this day.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.880
I’m so sorry.

00:08:57.552 --> 00:08:58.760
I’m sorry.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.248
I have never thought

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.544
you would see me as someone insincere.

00:09:05.304 --> 00:09:07.300
I was never angry at you guys

00:09:07.328 --> 00:09:09.300
for having escaped first.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.776
I’m even thankful

00:09:13.192 --> 00:09:15.190
that after Chat helped me out,

00:09:15.216 --> 00:09:17.824
you guys brought me to the hospital in time.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.280
Otherwise, I would have been dead.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.832
I’m sorry.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.400
What’s going on?

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.472
I was wheeling around carelessly.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.184
So I fell down the stairs.

00:09:50.664 --> 00:09:52.660
Chompoo wanted to help me

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.824
but she probably can’t handle it.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.112
Would you mind taking me upstairs?

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:00.650
Sure.

00:10:20.632 --> 00:10:22.460
The dead body in the well?

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.540
Yes.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.736
That area used to be a well.

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.584
But it was covered up after the incident.

00:10:33.304 --> 00:10:35.016
And whose body was that?

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.368
Why do you say that person
is the cause of everything?

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:46.424
My memory of that woman is very hazy.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.584
Because I was young.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.528
But what I can remember clearly

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.200
is that she was a very kind woman.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:10.432
Tell me,

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:11.992
how much money do you want?

00:11:12.016 --> 00:11:13.760
I’m not agreeing to anything.

00:11:13.808 --> 00:11:15.176
You also have a family.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.276
Aren’t you afraid that one day,

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.312
your wife and kids would be in trouble

00:11:17.336 --> 00:11:19.056
because you’re doing this kind of business?

00:11:24.528 --> 00:11:26.530
I think we should talk about this inside.

00:11:26.968 --> 00:11:28.288
I can’t be here.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.552
I can’t pretend I don’t know about
what you’re doing.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.960
Then what do you want me to do?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.440
You don’t have to do anything.

00:11:35.464 --> 00:11:36.672
I’ll be the one leaving.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:38.848
That was the first time

00:11:39.712 --> 00:11:41.710
that I saw that woman getting angry.

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.608
She normally smiled

00:11:45.416 --> 00:11:47.420
and was always kind to me.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.872
That was the last time I saw her.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.176
Do you happen to remember who she was?

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.912
I can’t remember her name.

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.032
But from the memories that remain,

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.928
I think she was a worker at our farm

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:08.344
who happened to know my dad’s secret

00:12:09.488 --> 00:12:11.490
and my dad was furious.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.080
What did your father do wrong?

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.824
I don’t know either.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.936
We were suspicious about it

00:12:19.592 --> 00:12:21.590
but no one dared ask.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:27.576
I think it’s time I admit the truth

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:30.568
that my family

00:12:30.608 --> 00:12:31.864
have been hurting people around them

00:12:31.888 --> 00:12:33.860
and even the people within the family all along.

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:40.408
Being born as their children

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.984
really hurts so much.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:47.944
I don’t want to bear this feeling anymore.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.208
I want to break free.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.880
I used to want to be like my dad.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.768
I wanted to be successful like him.

00:12:57.512 --> 00:12:59.510
But I know now that

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.968
I don’t want to be like my dad.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:15.776
When will you stop avoiding me?

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.176
Until I don’t have to see you again.

00:13:20.688 --> 00:13:22.032
I’m sorry.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:25.120
I can apologize to you
a thousand times over if you want

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.640
But it was because back then,

00:13:27.672 --> 00:13:29.880
I wasn’t ready to throw away my life and my dream.

00:13:29.928 --> 00:13:31.600
So you were willing to do anything

00:13:31.648 --> 00:13:33.992
to get off the hook of being a suspect.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:36.832
Admit it.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.816
That you only love yourself.

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:44.888
Your family is so twisted.

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.192
You guys can do anything

00:13:47.216 --> 00:13:49.752
just to get away with what you did.

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:51.584
You lied.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.808
You used people.

00:13:53.856 --> 00:13:55.224
You played with my head.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.448
You can even hurt yourself.

00:13:58.488 --> 00:13:59.936
You can lie even to yourself

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.176
that you had to do it

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:03.976
for yourself.

00:14:05.728 --> 00:14:06.728
Is this it?

00:14:07.168 --> 00:14:09.170
The thoughts of the selfish rich people.

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:14.936
You can condemn me all you want.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.640
But you can never understand

00:14:18.936 --> 00:14:21.544
the kind of risks I had to face,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
that made me have to lie like this.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.136
You’re saying your life was at risk

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:27.856
so you had to lie.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.040
What about the lives of the others?

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:32.104
The lives of the others

00:14:32.144 --> 00:14:34.784
who had to face the consequences of your lies.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.424
Were they worthless?

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.384
You’re no different from your dad.

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:46.890
I’m sorry.

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.544
But I can’t love this kind of woman.

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.704
Hey!

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.856
Calm down!

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:10.792
I should have known.

00:15:10.816 --> 00:15:13.560
Why would such a girl be interested in me?

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.312
Of course, she must have done it for something.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.056
She might not have meant to do it.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.976
But she had to do it to survive.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.904
I also believe she hasn’t said everything.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:29.992
Why?

00:15:30.016 --> 00:15:31.296
What else do you think is there?

00:15:32.664 --> 00:15:34.660
Do you remember that skeleton we found?

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:38.384
It was because the CCTV caught that man

00:15:38.424 --> 00:15:40.584
looking like he was trying to dig up something, right?

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:43.864
What if he did it

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:46.640
for us to find the skeleton?

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:49.312
Could that be possible?

00:15:49.344 --> 00:15:52.136
That man, the skeleton we found,

00:15:52.176 --> 00:15:53.848
and Chatfah’s death.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.720
Could it be possible that they’re all related?

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.808
And according to Picha’s testimony,

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.740
she said the skeleton might belong to

00:16:01.784 --> 00:16:04.064
someone who used to work with her dad.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.896
It was a story from a long time ago.

00:16:07.688 --> 00:16:09.690
The workers who used to be there had all quit.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.048
No one knew what happened.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.616
Then aren’t we supposed to ask

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.776
from someone who had quit?

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:19.110
Yes.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:23.200
I have the address of the previous manager
of the farm who had quit.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:26.900
Who’s that?

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:28.768
Her name is Fai.

00:16:29.008 --> 00:16:30.568
Would you want to talk to her yourself?

00:16:46.248 --> 00:16:47.664
This is murder.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.200
Your dad intentionally killed my dad

00:16:52.232 --> 00:16:53.392
to hide the secret.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.752
Even if I were to say I understand you,

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.544
it wouldn’t make up to half of what you feel.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.696
To hide all these f*cked up shits,

00:17:13.296 --> 00:17:15.300
how many people did your dad have to kill?

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:17.450
Hmm?

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:21.056
You used to say

00:17:21.096 --> 00:17:23.176
that your family is like it’s been cursed.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.584
But even if your family
were to be cursed for 7 generations,

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.872
it still wouldn’t make up for what your dad did.

00:17:35.864 --> 00:17:37.860
What you guys are going through

00:17:38.776 --> 00:17:40.780
can’t even compare

00:17:41.056 --> 00:17:43.880
to the f*cked up shits your dad did!

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:18.984
I know that

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.992
the word “sorry” might not be able to

00:18:24.016 --> 00:18:26.704
make up for what happened.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:32.144
But there’s really nothing else I can do.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:38.580
I…

00:18:39.248 --> 00:18:40.768
I’m sorry.

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:46.984
You know what?

00:18:47.656 --> 00:18:49.660
I hate your dad so much right now.

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:55.168
Right now in my head,

00:18:55.224 --> 00:18:56.680
there are only thoughts

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.736
about how to make your dad wretch.

00:18:59.984 --> 00:19:01.980
To make your dad feel the pain

00:19:02.096 --> 00:19:03.560
the way I do.

00:19:06.784 --> 00:19:07.984
Do you know?

00:19:08.976 --> 00:19:10.752
I hate myself so much

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.584
for not being able to do anything.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.600
Right after all these things end,

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:33.576
I will leave you.

00:19:39.176 --> 00:19:41.180
And I hope we never meet again.

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.768
I don’t believe you.

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.072
That you falling down the stairs was an accident.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.872
But if you don’t want to talk about it,

00:20:00.904 --> 00:20:02.000
then I won’t ask.

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.736
Can I ask you something?

00:20:09.456 --> 00:20:11.460
Why did you become a police officer?

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:17.384
My dad was a policeman.

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.408
He also died in duty.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:27.160
Back then, I didn’t know what my dream was

00:20:27.976 --> 00:20:29.980
until I saw it at my dad’s funeral.

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:33.792
The way people will perceive you

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.248
when you do the right thing.

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.584
I want to get such compliments too.

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:42.960
But when you’re dead,

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.160
what would you do with those compliments?

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:49.664
That’s what set my dad and me apart.

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:53.640
I want to hear those compliments
when I’m still alive

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:55.632
so I became a police officer.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.200
I was just wondering

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:06.208
how it feels to achieve your dreams.

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:09.560
Ever since I was born,

00:21:10.392 --> 00:21:11.968
I dare say that,

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:14.072
I’ve never achieved it.

00:21:15.808 --> 00:21:17.810
My dream career,

00:21:18.184 --> 00:21:20.180
I’ve given that up long ago.

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.744
But the dream to live a peaceful life

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.360
with someone who truly loves me,

00:21:28.384 --> 00:21:30.380
I don’t know why it’s so hard to achieve.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.000
And now I have no one left.

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:43.720
I just want someone who stays by my side.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.712
Is it too much to ask?

00:22:03.048 --> 00:22:04.048
Oh!

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.984
What medicine is that?

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.592
It’s my medicine.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.824
What is it for?

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.000
It’s not like the ones from the hospital.

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:57.328
And…

00:22:57.376 --> 00:22:59.032
What brings you here?

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.400
The thing is…

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:11.280
I pushed Parn down the stairs.

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:13.816
Hear me out.

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:16.568
That night on the rooftop,

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.600
I saw someone impersonating Chatfah

00:23:19.976 --> 00:23:22.064
and I almost caught who it was.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.688
I scratched her arm

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:28.752
and Parn has a scratch like the one I made.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.704
You weren’t just drunk and saw things, were you?

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.600
I thought I was drunk at first

00:23:35.656 --> 00:23:37.328
but when I saw the scratch,

00:23:37.352 --> 00:23:38.776
I believed I was right.

00:23:38.808 --> 00:23:41.744
There was also the person
who sent the basket with a threat.

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:46.216
So you pushed her off the stairs

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:51.112
because you were wondering
if she was really disabled?

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:54.110
Yeah.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:56.384
Are you out of your mind?

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.680
Oh…

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:04.680
So how was it?

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.112
Was she pretending?

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.800
The thing is, she wasn’t.

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:11.048
She really couldn’t walk.

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:18.824
If I can’t find the one who killed Chat,

00:24:20.368 --> 00:24:22.370
Nathat’s grandma won’t leave me alone.

00:24:26.816 --> 00:24:28.768
You’re doing everything

00:24:29.416 --> 00:24:31.420
to make Nathat’s grandma accept you

00:24:31.448 --> 00:24:34.760
and believe that you’re not the murderer?

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.880
Well…

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:43.624
I also want to find out who killed Chat.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:52.440
So do you think

00:24:53.016 --> 00:24:55.020
that after you’ve proven yourself,

00:24:56.392 --> 00:24:58.390
Nathat’s grandma will accept you?

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:12.152
Actually,

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:17.856
Nathat was two-timing you from the start.

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.296
Nathat agreed to marry Chat

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:24.680
because she was blackmailing him.

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.064
That’s what he told you,

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:30.088
so you believed him?

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:38.368
Nathat and Chatfah were secretly seeing each other

00:25:39.256 --> 00:25:41.260
even before you started getting to know Nathat.

00:25:44.752 --> 00:25:45.752
That’s not true.

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:50.664
Chatfah didn’t steal Nathat from you.

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:56.344
But it was you

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:00.340
who stole Nathat from Chatfah.

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:08.096
You’re afraid that you’d lose your toy

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.792
so much that you have to say that?

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.520
You may say that.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:16.192
I can do even worse.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.504
I was wrong.

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:24.320
To think that you could be trusted.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:32.352
What about Nathat?

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.616
How many times has he lied to you?

00:26:37.768 --> 00:26:40.049
Yet you’re still stupid enough
to go back and believe him.

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:42.152
There’s only me

00:26:42.184 --> 00:26:43.672
who have been doing everything for you.

00:26:43.696 --> 00:26:45.784
Why do you never see my worth?

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:47.896
Then don’t do it.

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:54.640
Don’t forget that our relationship

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.520
has never involved love from the start.

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:18.696
Don’t you get tired of painting all day?

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.744
Well, I don’t.

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:23.744
I keep switching up techniques.

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:27.080
That’s nice.

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:29.672
It’s like you don’t have to be
ambitious about anything.

00:27:29.696 --> 00:27:30.936
It doesn’t tire you out either.

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.224
I like living quietly.

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:37.128
I don’t like competing with people.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.968
But I think for people like you,

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:45.320
if you really want something

00:27:45.352 --> 00:27:46.832
then you would do anything to get it.

00:27:48.696 --> 00:27:50.700
Doesn’t matter if the method is right or wrong.

00:27:51.504 --> 00:27:53.500
I think you’re that kind of person.

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:56.688
Because I’m just like you.

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:14.392
Alright, I’ll head out.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.944
I’ll get going.

00:28:16.968 --> 00:28:18.536
I’ll be your model again later.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.432
Are you hungry?

00:28:27.456 --> 00:28:28.184
Yes.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.552
What shall we have for dinner?

00:28:29.576 --> 00:28:31.040
Is it your treat?

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.080
Yeah.

00:28:57.056 --> 00:28:58.264
Wait here.

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:10.504
Are you sure you really spot intruders?

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:11.968
Yes.

00:29:12.144 --> 00:29:14.536
We’ve just installed a new infrared detector

00:29:14.568 --> 00:29:17.072
after someone had trespassed back then.

00:29:17.104 --> 00:29:18.152
When the system alarmed me,

00:29:18.176 --> 00:29:19.768
I informed you right away.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.800
Then please check on that side.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:22.856
Let me know if there’s anything.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.056
I’ll check the other end.

00:29:24.096 --> 00:29:25.096
Yes, Sir.

00:29:37.832 --> 00:29:38.920
It’s you indeed.

00:29:45.968 --> 00:29:46.648
I…

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.424
I can explain.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.904
Keep your explanations for the police station.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:52.832
It’s not like what you think.

00:29:52.856 --> 00:29:54.344
I didn’t do anything wrong.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.800
Everyone who’s been caught says this.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.200
Turn around.

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:02.384
Arms behind your back.

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:38.672
Go! Go!

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:41.792
Hey!

00:30:41.824 --> 00:30:42.824
Chain!

00:30:43.008 --> 00:30:45.010
Go ahead and follow them!

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:04.472
Damn it!

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.360
That was one hell of a kick.

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:14.330
Urgh.

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:17.800
What do we do?

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:30.168
You didn’t tell me

00:31:30.208 --> 00:31:32.376
that there was a new security system.

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.352
I was the one who brought it up at the meeting.

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.488
But I left the house before that

00:31:40.512 --> 00:31:41.984
so I didn’t know it was done.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:44.824
How can you forget such an important thing?

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.416
What about you?

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:49.528
Did you forget anything important?

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.120
Forget what?

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.280
You forgot to tell me about this.

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.680
Your dad’s file.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:41.608
It was mixed among the files from the basement.

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:44.880
At first,

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.840
I thought you and Chat met

00:32:48.872 --> 00:32:50.792
because our parents had an affair.

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:53.928
But the truth is not like that.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.328
Look at the last page.

00:33:04.216 --> 00:33:05.544
You lied to me.

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:10.616
You’re actually not Chat’s lover.

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:15.192
But you are Chat’s stepbrother.

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:26.360
And Chatfah is not
Asok Bupphachinda’s daughter.

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:33.008
But a daughter of Chad,

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:34.630
your father.

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:47.288
When were you planning to tell me this?

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.984
I didn’t plan to tell you in the first place.

00:33:58.580 --> 00:33:59.580
Why?

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:01.632
Are you afraid that if Chat didn’t die,

00:34:01.648 --> 00:34:03.104
she wouldn’t get the legacy?

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:07.888
That’s part of it.

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:11.984
But the most important thing is Chatfah’s safety.

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:17.312
I don’t know if Chatfah would be in danger

00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:20.352
if anyone learned about this truth.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:22.800
I knew it.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.344
It shouldn’t have trusted someone like you from the start.

00:34:27.408 --> 00:34:29.744
You’re just using me.

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:31.192
Using you?

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:36.160
Did you forget that I saved you?

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:38.500
You saved me because
you wanted something in return.

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:42.568
You have so many secrets hidden

00:34:43.168 --> 00:34:45.170
yet you still want me to trust you?

00:34:47.184 --> 00:34:49.688
I almost forgot

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.664
that you’re still the daughter

00:34:52.696 --> 00:34:54.232
of the man who murdered my dad.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.528
We don’t need to trust each other anyway.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:11.960
You’re here to find out the truth about your dad

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:16.352
and now, you know everything.

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:26.112
So the two of us

00:35:26.664 --> 00:35:28.660
no longer need to stay together.

00:36:01.568 --> 00:36:03.570
Did anyone notice you coming in?

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:04.600
No.

00:36:04.968 --> 00:36:06.970
I was being careful just as you told me to.

00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:10.096
Is there anything?

00:36:10.128 --> 00:36:11.264
Why did you call me in?

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:16.056
Were you in a relationship with Chat,

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:20.368
and slept with Chat

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.960
before seeing me?

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:33.270
Don’t lie.

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:36.528
I’m begging you.

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:43.860
Yes.

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:50.168
Before getting to know you,

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:55.680
I had slept with Chat.

00:37:01.104 --> 00:37:03.100
But I wasn’t in a relationship with Chatfah.

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:06.416
We weren’t even a thing.

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:12.664
I know it’s not fair for Chat.

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:15.400
I’m sorry.

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:19.696
I understand if you can’t forgive me for this.

00:37:26.288 --> 00:37:27.288
The thing is…

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:31.384
I don’t know what to feel anymore.

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:38.816
It’s like I got betrayed by you.

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:41.520
Got fooled by you.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.576
Over and over again.

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:51.970
Chom.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.344
I know I did so many wrong things.

00:38:01.256 --> 00:38:03.376
But I’m trying to make it right.

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:37.920
Sorry for troubling you
so early in the morning, Chompoo.

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:39.570
It’s alright.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.248
Is there anything?

00:38:41.448 --> 00:38:42.856
We brought a warrant.

00:38:42.888 --> 00:38:45.440
We’d like to invite you in for an investigation.

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.616
About what?

00:38:59.456 --> 00:39:01.460
Have you ever seen this pair of scissors, Chompoo?

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.328
From our initial examination,

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:17.200
the blood on the scissors is confirmed to be Chatfah’s.

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:19.976
We suspect that this is the weapon

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.200
which killed Chatfah.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.080
Besides Chatfah’s fingerprints,

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:30.016
we also found Chompoo’s fingerprints on it.

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:43.800
Why are you here?

00:39:43.832 --> 00:39:44.784
If you’re going to sell something,

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.328
I don’t have any money for that.

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:50.560
No, I’m looking for someone named ‘Fai’.

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:53.704
She used to be the farm manager
at the Buppha Company.

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:55.912
If you found her, then let me know.

00:39:55.936 --> 00:39:57.104
What do you mean?

00:39:57.128 --> 00:39:59.208
She’s been gone for over 10 years.

00:39:59.256 --> 00:40:02.584
I’m her sister, yet she didn’t even tell me anything.

00:40:02.616 --> 00:40:04.440
Didn’t she leave any words?

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:10.016
She called Mom once.

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:12.904
Saying that she had a problem with her husband

00:40:12.936 --> 00:40:14.328
and wanted to bring her child to us.

00:40:14.352 --> 00:40:16.056
But in the end, she didn’t come.

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:19.416
Recently, people were saying her husband’s dead

00:40:19.448 --> 00:40:21.512
but she still hasn’t come back.

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:23.968
If you really want to see her,

00:40:24.008 --> 00:40:25.490
then go to her husband’s house.

00:40:25.512 --> 00:40:28.144
The maid named Chomchai seems to know everything

00:40:28.176 --> 00:40:29.592
she might be able to answer you.

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:31.024
Hold on.

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:33.600
Who is Fai’s husband?

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:35.632
It’s Kajorn.

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:38.336
Fai managed to bag herself a rich husband

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:39.584
but she has a low taste

00:40:39.616 --> 00:40:41.260
and ran away with a worker at the farm.

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:44.840
Fai, the manager of the farm,

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:47.248
was Kajorn’s wife?

00:40:47.288 --> 00:40:49.368
Oh, that's right.

00:40:50.672 --> 00:40:55.152
Then her daughter is Parn?

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.024
Yes?

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:07.070
Chom!

00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:14.160
I hope you will provide full cooperation
for this investigation.

00:41:17.328 --> 00:41:20.792
Do you know who sent the scissors?

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:22.464
I’d rather not answer.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.664
Even if you don’t say it,

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.632
I kind of know who it was.

00:41:28.784 --> 00:41:30.256
And I’m telling you now,

00:41:30.296 --> 00:41:31.992
that person can’t be trusted.

00:41:32.232 --> 00:41:34.192
I don’t trust anyone easily, neither.

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:37.576
Especially, everyone involved in this case.

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:40.728
The only thing I believe in is the evidence.

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.048
What if I tell you that

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.192
the evidence was staged?

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:50.664
Do you have anything to prove that?

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.120
The thing is…

00:41:59.608 --> 00:42:01.610
The truth is, that night…

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:04.020
It’s…

00:42:08.304 --> 00:42:09.768
I was with

00:42:17.832 --> 00:42:19.830
Chompoo didn’t stab Chatfah.

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:22.152
I can prove it.

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.608
Because that night,

00:42:24.648 --> 00:42:26.610
I was there with Chompoo.

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:31.136
During the time Chatfah got stabbed and fell down,

00:42:31.168 --> 00:42:33.432
I and Chompoo…

00:42:34.096 --> 00:42:35.168
We were…

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:38.340
Um…

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:40.008
We were together in a room.

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:43.872
So Chompoo can’t have been the one
who stabbed Chatfah.

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:49.568
The evidence is the GPS tracking of my car

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.570
on the day Chatfah disappeared.

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:54.664
If you check it, you’ll see that

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:56.660
there’s Bupphachat Mansion on it.

00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:59.824
There are the time stamps of when I got there

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:01.888
and when I left.

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:04.312
I also have the record of the car’s camera

00:43:04.336 --> 00:43:07.168
with my phone conversation with Chompoo recorded.

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:12.568
All the information is in here.

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:28.980
Khem.

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:30.552
Where’s my sister?

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.000
Chom!

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.040
Pi!

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:12.808
I found the last bag of
the tea you like in the kitchen.

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:13.840
Drink up.

00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:16.088
Thank you.

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:33.040
Picha, we’ve bailed Chompoonuch out to defend her case.

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:34.744
But don’t worry.

00:44:34.784 --> 00:44:37.472
During this time, we’ll also be gathering evidence

00:44:37.512 --> 00:44:40.104
to prove Chompoonuch’s innocence.

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:48.450
Don’t worry.

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:51.320
I’m not the culprit.

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:53.688
I’m not afraid.

00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:59.704
I’ll be heading back to my apartment right away.

00:44:59.736 --> 00:45:01.152
Do you want to come with me?

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:04.752
I brought my car.

00:45:05.690 --> 00:45:07.216
I’d better go back by myself.

00:45:07.232 --> 00:45:10.384
I think I want to rest a little longer.

00:45:10.808 --> 00:45:11.952
Okay.

00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:26.944
Thank you for today.

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:31.760
It’s something I should’ve done long ago.

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.520
GRANDMA

00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:44.920
There are so many things to be done tomorrow.

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:47.416
I have to answer my Grandma’s questions.

00:45:47.456 --> 00:45:48.696
And also the press’s.

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:51.552
Prepare your answers well.

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:54.816
There’s no need to prepare.

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:58.584
I’ve decided to only speak the truth.

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:01.712
I’ll get going.

00:46:01.744 --> 00:46:02.816
Okay.

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:34.704
THANA

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:37.000
Yeah?

00:46:37.032 --> 00:46:38.224
Don’t call me again.

00:46:38.248 --> 00:46:39.576
We don’t have anything to discuss.

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.056
(Don’t hang up yet!)

00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:43.016
I didn’t send the scissors to the police.

00:46:48.632 --> 00:46:50.392
Someone broke into my house

00:46:50.424 --> 00:46:51.960
and took the scissors.

00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:57.352
Those who know best about the scissors

00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.320
are your family.

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:44.720
Some warm tea helps you sleep well.

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:46.032
Don’t you think?

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:55.160
(The game of life is full of danger.)

00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:59.048
(Every victory has a prize.)

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:05.680
(Likewise, )

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:08.976
(every loss has a price to pay.)

00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:15.912
You guys don’t die so easily.

00:48:15.936 --> 00:48:19.072
I have to use so much power.

00:48:19.096 --> 00:48:21.070
(No matter the method.)

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:24.984
(Whether it’s right or wrong.)

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:28.192
Please don’t be angry at me.

00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:29.696
Think of it as

00:48:29.736 --> 00:48:34.616
paying for what your dad did to me.

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:42.464
You hag!

00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:44.870
Pi!

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:46.408
(It’s not as important as)

00:48:46.432 --> 00:48:47.944
(whether or not you’re winning.)

00:48:48.208 --> 00:48:49.208
Picha!

00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:50.330
Picha!

00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:52.630
Picha!

00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:53.952
Picha, don’t sleep yet–

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:07.920
This picture should be on the news, saying

00:49:07.952 --> 00:49:11.816
“Sisters committed suicide together
to escape the guilt.”

00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:18.368
But you guys probably won’t live to see it.

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:20.712
Keep your mouth open.

00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:25.368
(Therefore, one thing the player should keep in mind is)

00:49:25.416 --> 00:49:26.416
Eat up!

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:28.104
Eat up!

00:49:29.016 --> 00:49:30.016
Eat up!

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:32.376
Argh!

00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:36.304
If you have so much grudge against Dad,

00:49:36.328 --> 00:49:38.176
then go get your revenge in hell.

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:40.400
(If the rule is unfair, )

00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:43.776
(then there’s no need to play by the rules.)

00:49:43.832 --> 00:49:45.288
Don’t f*cking bother my sisters.

00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:47.200
Argh!

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.680
It was probably a car crash against a tree.

00:49:57.712 --> 00:50:00.072
She was the one who killed Uncle Kajorn and Chat.

00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:04.136
You investigated everything in this by yourself?

00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:05.568
Let me stay like this

00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:06.784
for a little longer.

00:50:06.816 --> 00:50:08.984
Any progress on Sarah’s case?

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:10.952
The police found out everything.

00:50:10.984 --> 00:50:12.472
I’m suspecting that

00:50:12.504 --> 00:50:16.672
the will we read might have been written anew.
