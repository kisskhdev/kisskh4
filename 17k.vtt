00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:35.451


00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.160
Fu Yudong...

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.520
Jeez!

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.840
You're like a ninja.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.479
Any luck?

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.000
Awesome!

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.000
Hey, I need to get water.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.680
C'mon,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.800
let's try something fun,

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.480
a dare game.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.680
Eyes closed.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.880
I might trip!

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.759
Trust me.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.680
You too then.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.640
Deal, ready?

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.760
There's a step

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.680
exactly 367.23 mm

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.720
ahead.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.720
Right foot first, follow me.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.400
Now forward.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.720
Dining table's diagonal left,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.720
two chairs there.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.600
Careful now!

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.920
Staying close,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.920
no funny business!

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.480
Keep walking.

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.360
Cabinet behind.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.560
Moving on,

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.320
doorframe ahead,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.360
cardboards underneath.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.400
Keep going,

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.720
chair on your right,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.240
and our stove's

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.200
right in front of it.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.640
Stay with me.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.200
Sure thing.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.920
Stove's about

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.080
one meter ahead.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.680
Don't reach out yet,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.960
not there.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.840
I've

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.960
banged into it enough

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.680
to map it out.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.320
Keep going...

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.360
Fridge on right!

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.680
Well?

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.520
Opening eyes?

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.240
Yep.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.079
Amazing!

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.880
What drink?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.720
This!

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.440
Me?

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.520
Same.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.160
Gonna unscrew it.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.840
Watch this move!

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.800
Seen that video?

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.960
Too dark now!

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.520
That viral one,

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.680
you know?

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.400
Give it.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.360
It's fizzy!

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.920
Fine.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.520
Dare's over,

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.920
truth time?

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.560
OK.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.120
The snacks in the nightstand,

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.720
your doing?

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.120
Nope.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.000
Who then?

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.440
Raccoon did it.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.680
What's making this

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.600
so heavy?

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.280
We could leave this.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.200
You take all

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.720
the kitchen stuff...

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.960
Your folks OK with that?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.880
They have enough.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.200
We need basics,

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.480
no time to shop.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.760
Let's get this picture up,

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.519
alright?

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.279
That mess

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.680
can wait.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.120
Checking...

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:22.160
Cool, all good.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.960
Where to?

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.000
I'll just stand here

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.880
forever,

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.520
greeting you.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.600
Perfect,

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.320
you're our new decoration.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.200
A nail there.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.720
Perfect spot.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.120
Done.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.520
It's crooked. Can't tell?

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.680
Look yourself, see?

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:39.000
See!

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.480
Right side's off.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.440
Direct me from there.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.680
C'mon!

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.680
Outside's fine.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.680
In!

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.600
Market research, now!

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.920
Hey,

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.520
our future

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.600
territory!

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.080
Need help,

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.240
sir?

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.760
Thanks.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.880
But just planning.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.080
Hey,

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.400
see this chaos?

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.520
Feel that?

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.440
Total amateur hour.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.720
Our launch

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.760
will be different.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.680
One product

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.600
per counter.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.680
Here,

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.360
only our

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.680
star product:

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.880
anti-aging cream.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.600
There,

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.880
our allergy serum.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.160
Eye cream section!

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.320
Masks displayed properly,

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.520
not this

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.360
messy arrangement.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.360
Clean, organized,

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.440
premium!

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.560
Body lotion here,

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.840
sunscreen

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:45.000
here,

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.159
perfect summer...

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.880
Shush.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.680
Whatever line...

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.760
- Keep it down.
- What?

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.680
Everyone's looking.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.720
So what?

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.080
Your face's

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.720
gonna be everywhere.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.120
They're lucky to

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.320
see you live,

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.520
soon it'll be all billboards,

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.040
y'know!

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.280
Shut up!

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.040
Just you wait!

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.520
I'll have Xing Kai

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.160
shoot

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.400
your commercial.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.120
Playing right here,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.760
non-stop.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.040
You'll be

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.000
our permanent fixture!

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.000
Snap outta it!

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.200
Seriously,

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.520
your fantasies are

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.400
getting wild.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.640
Fantasies?

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.120
Dr. Fu,

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.120
we just registered

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.440
the trademark!

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.880
This is

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.800
happening

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.680
for sure!

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.760
It's real!

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.720
You're making me

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.960
more uncertain.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.159
Why's that?

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.720
We're new to business.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.480
I don't understand financials.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.080
Plus you sold your house.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.480
Why worry?

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:48.720
Stop there.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.040
That's not for ears!

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.920
Talked to Xing Kai,

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.159
he happens

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.600
to know

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.920
a pro manager,

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.000
fresh out of

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.160
a listed company.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.000
Perfect timing

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.800
to join us.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.360
I'm planning

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.880
to check offices soon.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.280
I'll swing by to catch up with them.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.120
Don't worry.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.720
Let experts

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.160
handle their part!

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.880
Just focus on

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.360
being CEO!

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.520
Picking my ears, back off!

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.360
Gentlemen,

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.440
would you like to

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.520
try our

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.120
free samples?

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:22.920
- Sure!
- No, thanks.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.360
Show me

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.200
errr...

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.960
Dr. Fu's cosmetics.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.240
Sorry,

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.400
never heard of

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.840
that brand.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.200
Daoqi!

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.280
You will soon.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.159
These are free?

00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:45.720
Yes.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.440
Taking one.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.120
Yo, bounce!

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:47.520
Thanks!

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.240
Goodbye!

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.240
Thanks again!

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:50.600
What's wrong?

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.520
So embarrassing.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.280
Why?

00:07:53.159 --> 00:07:53.640
Sorry!

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.480
You know why.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.320
Watch where you're going!

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.480
Hello,

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.240
can we have our ball back?

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:12.360
Dude,

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.160
from

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.520
now on,

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.040
done with passing.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.080
Shooting's my thing!

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.360
Fine!

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.800
I'll be your

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.720
sidekick!

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.720
You and I, we'll

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.880
rule the universe!

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.720
The universe...

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.600
I just wanna

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.280
get your house money back!

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.120
Think bigger!

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.280
You've got to risk it

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:38.320
for the biscuit!

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.520
Which "risk" are we talking,

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.480
gambling

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.400
or trying?

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.560
Same difference, innit?

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.360
No way!

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.960
One means gambling, one means effort!

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Totally different!

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:52.880
C'mon!

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.120
Offside!

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:05.800
Honey.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.120
I'm...

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.880
at Mom's.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.400
Yeah, with Yudong.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.480
My breath?

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.440
What's up?

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.480
OK, coming home.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.320
Cool, home

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.080
for dinner!

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.240
Sure thing!

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.120
I'm on my way!

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.080
Cool, OK!

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.280
Real smooth, "at Mom's," sure.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.640
Haven't told her about

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.720
the startup.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.120
Keep quiet about it!

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.920
Big shot here with me,

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:39.960
can't even

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.320
level with your wife.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.520
Does she know

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.720
you sold your house?

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.080
Once

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.480
the business is up,

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.640
I'll break it to her gently.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.720
Not a word!

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:54.360
I'm off!

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:55.800
Later!

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.440
Back to our respective realities!

00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:59.800
Last goal,

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.720
then I'm gone!

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.120
3, 2, 1, dropping the link!

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:08.880
Next up,

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.400
we've got the amazing

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.080
posture corrector!

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.480
You know it,

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.280
BackBuddy's back in action!

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.000
Check out

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.120
how sharp

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.000
Xiaojian looks

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.720
wearing it!

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.960
Without BackBuddy,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.280
everyone,

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.640
guys and girls alike,

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.000
ends up looking all slouched

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.880
and sketchy.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.320
That slouchy look

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.480
makes you seem

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.720
super depressed

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.160
and miserable.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:35.920
But

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.920
pop on a BackBuddy,

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.120
boom!

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.080
Shoulders squared,

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.480
chest proud,

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.320
slimmer back!

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.560
This posture corrector

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.520
is absolutely life-changing!

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.120
Ran, hanging in there?

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.080
All good,

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.640
no sweat,

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:53.800
no success!

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.440
Watch how BackBuddy

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.840
turns her

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.320
into an instant dancer,

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.880
a ballet star!

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:01.680
See it?

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.160
Such a different aura!

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:03.920
Amazing!

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.720
Looking good?

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.640
Beautiful!

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:07.360
Launch sales.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.280
Let's go!

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:09.360
Now

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.640
for our next product,

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.760
one of our absolute

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.920
star items!

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.520
Users

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.480
have seen

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.080
incredible

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.840
slimming results!

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:20.920
Here comes

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.440
starch blocker,

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.520
with three flavors.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.680
Xiaojian, tell us about them.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.080
Today's special lineup:

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:26.960
grape, coffee,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.440
and cola.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:28.920
Perfect.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:29.680
Ran,

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.720
try the cola.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.480
Absolutely.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.280
I'll go for coffee.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:33.560
Alrighty!

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.040
Then grape for me!

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:35.640
C'mon,

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.920
let's try them out.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.040
Give it a try.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:38.520
OK.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.560
Feeling full already.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.600
Right?

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.520
The coffee one

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.280
is just like a latte,

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.200
super rich and creamy.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:51.920
Yours?

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:00.720
Hold on,

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.080
this is cola, right?

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:03.640
Yeah.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.080
I rarely

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.280
drink cola,

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:06.760
when I

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.560
taste it,

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.720
my...

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:09.920
um...

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.600
face kinda... reacts.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.400
So, after tasting it...

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.600
definitely cola flavor,

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.720
very strong taste.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.720
So this is...

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.040
perfectly fine.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.800
So excited to

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.240
share this experience

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.520
with everyone.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.320

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.400
3, 2, 1

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.080
link is live!

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.120
You OK in there?

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.160
Like glue

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.000
in my throat.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.600
Need anything?

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.520
Better after throwing up.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.480
Anran.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:52.520
Is she OK?

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.400
I'm OK.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:53.760
You sure?

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:54.280
Yes, yes.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.200
Got meds?

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:55.720
Yeah.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.400
Get it.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.000
Will do.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.600
One sip's nothing.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.720
Did I ruin your stream?

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:00.840
Sorry,

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.360
Xiaohe

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.680
messed up.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.680
Wrong samples.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:05.880
Not intentional.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:06.720
It's cool.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:07.920
Dinner's on me sometime.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.560
OK.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:09.920
Such a trooper.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.320
Always my fault!

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.360
Easy target!

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.640
Blame me!

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.520
Picking on me...

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.560
You're nuts?

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.640
Came for ramen...

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.520
Here.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.280
Take 'em all!

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:44.080
Enough.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:44.920
They're good.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:45.560
I'm okay.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.120
Hey...

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.600
Compensation

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.680
for emotional damage!

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:52.760
What's wrong?

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.280
Nothing...

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.320
just...

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.760
boss stuff.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:09.560
Ah, boss issues.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.280
She eats fancy...

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.440
While we get snacks,

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.240
she'd claim

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.560
"You're family!"

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.200
Pure manipulation!

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.280
Yeah, yeah.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:27.160
Right.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:29.600
But listen,

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:30.760
back when I

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.000

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:39.960
Here?

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.080

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.240

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.160

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.240

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.360
she's good to me.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.000
Oh yeah,

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.160

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:01.480
the comments?

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:02.480
Nope,

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.160
but I can see them.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:06.360

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.800

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.160

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.680

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.560
Such nasty comments...

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.360

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.720

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.240

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.920
Really annoying,

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:25.520

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.240

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.280
It's great!

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.280
After she yells at me,

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.800
I read her comments.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.920
The mean ones especially.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:38.600

[See ya!]

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.920
You bought the foot bath?

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:04.920
[Yes.]

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.359

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:11.720
Thanks.

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:13.000
But

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.280
let me know

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.160
before buying anything

Incredible.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.080
Ridiculous.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.480
No gratitude.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.440
You mean Ace?

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.440
My hubby.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.880
Bought his dad

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.200
a nice gift

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.520
and he gets

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:53.760
all upset.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.480
Why?

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.000
Weird with his dad.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.920
Won't visit, won't talk.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.080

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.440
Don't get it.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.720
Not that extreme,

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:06.280
but this is

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.600
pretty common.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.800
Like my dad and me...

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.440
When I was a kid,

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.520
he's up early

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.600
and home late selling fish.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.640
I hardly saw him.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.840
It's like we're strangers

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:16.920
sharing a meal.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:18.360
But then in college,

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.360
we'd catch up

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.960
every week, even if

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.640
just for 2 or 3 minutes.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Now?

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:26.680
Talk when

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.520
you're home?

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:28.160
Yeah!

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.480
Sort of.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.000
When mom's gone,

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.440
he's like,

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.280
"Order food."

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.320
I say "OK."

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.360
Before bed,

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.560
"Going to sleep."

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:40.360
He says, "Mm."

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:41.720
Grunts and nods, huh?

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:42.720
Basically.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.360
So my husband's

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.640
normal then.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.720
In Canada,

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.000
fathers and sons

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.960
are like buddies.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.320
Why are we

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.920
so different here?

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.240
Well, you know...

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.400

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.680

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:02.760
Beyond me.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:04.480
Ran.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.800
Why not make content about this?

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.760
About father-son dynamics?

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.440
Look,

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.240
your "rice guy" joke

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.000
about him was gold!

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.520
Such a hit.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.360
We thought

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:16.920
you'd do

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.040

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:19.720

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:20.240

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.400

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.280

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.320

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.240
Talking to you!

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.960
Did you watch it?

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:53.120
Yeah?

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.520
Focus!

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.880
I'm talking to you!

00:21:58.880 --> 00:21:59.720
Did you check

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.840
what I sent?

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:26.600
You good?

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:27.560
Yeah.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.280
[Guys, let's talk about something]

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.360
[heartfelt today.]

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.360
[Why do Chinese fathers and sons]

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.520
[often act like strangers]

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.520
[or enemies?]

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.360
[Experienced this?]

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:41.680
[When both sides]

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.400
[care deeply]

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:44.920
[but maintain]

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.600
[this cold exterior?]

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:47.880
[I wonder]

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.440
[why these blood ties...]

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.720
Home, honey!

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.960
What's all this?

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.800
Shoes off?

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.000
Nah!

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.600
Cardboard's down,

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:16.880
just come in.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:19.840
Door's done?

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:24.480
Whoa,

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:26.600
mattress here?

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.800
Wasn't that coming later?

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.960
Got a call,

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.320
said they could deliver today

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.320
if I was home.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.040
Said yes.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:35.680
Wow,

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.240
Ethan is back online!

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.360
You're amazing!

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.520
Working all day?

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:44.960
Exhausted?

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.160
I'm OK.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.720
Let me work

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:51.440
those knots out.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.920
Why so nice?

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.840
What's happening?

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:55.840
Come on,

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.680
I'm always

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.080
this nice!

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.520
Made content today?

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.240
About what?

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.320
Just daily stuff,

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.320
few views.

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.600
Nothing special,

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.680
don't bother watching.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.000
Didn't get promoted,

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:09.840
disappeared.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:10.680
Stop tapping,

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.760
can't align.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:15.440
Done.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:15.920
OK.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.160
Honey, I really can't live

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.200
without you!

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.960
Place looks fantastic,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.080
all your work!

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.280
Must celebrate.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.920
Your birthday's coming up,

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.640
let's make it special.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.280
I'll organize

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.280
everything.

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.400
Skip it, I don't do birthdays.

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.400
Can't skip birthdays!

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.520
Gotta celebrate!

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.240
Li Daoqi told me

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.440
the "Dr. Fu" trademark got

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:40.920
cleared.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:41.840
Need to handle stuff

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.520
that day.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.720
Might take a while.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.160
I'll grab quick noodles.

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:46.560
"Might take a while?"

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.240
No matter the time,

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.320
eat at home,

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.080
clear?

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.360
Got it.

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.640
Gotta finish the bathroom.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:53.920
Gonna work on it.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.320
Hello, can I help you?

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.000
I am Fu Yudong.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.320
Mr. Li here?

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.280
Mr. Li...

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.200
Mr. Li right here!

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:22.920
Mr. Li.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.160
No need to be nice.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.400
See strangers like this one,

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.400
kick'em out!

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.960
Meet Dr. Fu,

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.200
our CEO!

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.520
Look!

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:33.320
Welcome, Mr. Fu!

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:34.360
Hello.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:35.680
C'mon,

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:36.640
let me show you around.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:39.640
See this?

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.280
CEO's office!

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:45.720
Your office?

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:46.800
Yours.

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.240
Mine's all the way there.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.440
Isn't this too much?

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.760
We're barely a company.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:52.680
Be careful!

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:53.640
Staff's listening.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.520
Folks,

00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.800
meet our CEO,

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:00.680
Mr. Fu!

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.600
Mr. Fu!

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.080
Stay seated.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:05.760
Keep working, please.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.040
Continue everyone.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.360
All these people...

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.080
new hires?

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.520
Like I said,

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.560
Xing Kai's

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.400
pro manager

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.560
handled

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:16.440
recruitment.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:18.360
He said,

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.320
once we're settled,

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.520
we can hire more

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:21.440
ourselves.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:23.920
More staff?

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:25.320
C'mon,

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.160
that's

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.120
too expensive!

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.240
How many houses needed?

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.160
Are there any left?

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.440
Such small thinking!

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.160
Here,

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.000
your tag!

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:35.920
Listen,

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.080
no messing up

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:38.960
in there.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.480
Stay confident,

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:41.600
got it?

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:42.840
I'm decoration,

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.120
you talk, got it!

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:44.920
Alright,

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.080
perfect,

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:48.520
looking sharp!

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:49.560
Show time!

00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:59.520
Yudong,

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.320
Daoqi,

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:01.600
meet Michael,

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.400
whom I've always

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.080
brought up.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:05.560
Michael,

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.280
our CEO,

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:09.520
Dr. Fu Yudong.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.640
Sit, sit.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.160
And our COO,

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.720
Mr. Li Daoqi.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:18.720
Michael,

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.120
your introduction?

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:21.560
Hello,

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.480
Mr. Fu, Mr. Li.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.640
I'm Michael.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.240
About my background...

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.640
Economics at

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:26.560
an Ivy League,

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:27.840
then Big Four

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.400
consulting

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:28.840
for four years.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.360
In 2010...

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.280
yeah 2010,

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.120
went to Wharton for MBA.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.360
Since then,

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.320
I've worked with

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.560
startup companies

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.880
as corporate partner.

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.680
Wasn't quite successful

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.000
until meeting Mr. Xing.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.200
Mr. Xing...

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.080
he's been

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:43.920
my mentor,

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:44.160
absolutely.

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.240
Yeah.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.320
Taught me valuable lessons,

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.720
both

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:49.920
business and life.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.440
I'm confident Mr. Xing

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.120
chose you both

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.000
as partners

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.080
because you're

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.240
truly exceptional...

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.120
Can we trust this dude?

00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.520
Seems clever

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:00.160
but

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.320
not exactly...

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:02.760
We're

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.560
new to

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:05.000
management.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.160
What if...

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.520
No worry.

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.680
With Xing Kai's investment,

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.240
he wouldn't pick someone

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.360
who'd fail.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.320
True.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.880
Actually, our inexperience

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:17.720
is why

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.040
we need someone

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.320
like Michael.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.760
Let him demonstrate.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.720
We watch,

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:24.720
we learn.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.840
Simple, right?

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:29.840
Yeah,

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:31.680
watch and learn.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.520
Do you know

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:34.320
what my outfit's

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.120
called?

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.000
Business casual!

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.760
Deliberately underdressed

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.680
compared to his business professional.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:44.200
Shows him

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.280
who's really in charge

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.160
around here!

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:55.360
Yours is different!

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:57.320
That's

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.360
your PhD warrior gear!

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.520
Meaningful!

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.080
Power-up outfit!

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.680
Dude, we're all the way up,

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.960
no going down!

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:15.560
Enter.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:17.920
Mr. Li, Mr. Fu,

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.120
business cards ready.

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:19.880
Good.

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:20.680
Mr. Li's.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.400
-And these are Mr. Fu's. -Thanks.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.160
Thanks.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:22.920
Welcome.

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:24.760
"Mr. Fu (Second in charge)"

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.040
sounds odd,

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.680
doesn't it?

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.960
Yes, CEO

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.080
sounds like VP.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.320
It's OK!

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.160
Just a title.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.680
How about "Mr. Dong!"

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.040
Just kidding!

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.240
Why not!

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.040
Tell everyone,

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.000
dinner's

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.040
on me tonight.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.840
Michael's team already

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:46.920
left for dinner.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.320
Saving my money!

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.080
Just us three then.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.360
You pick a restaurant.

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.320
Still got work...

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.680
Fine, just us!

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.200
Executive meeting!

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:08.680
I...

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.520
Shut up!

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.360
Solo dinner then!

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.680
OK, I'm coming!

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:17.360
We were just messing around.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.440
Carry on.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.440
Right, leaving now.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.080
OK.

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.080
Jesse must think we're nuts.

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.200
We are.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.000
Li Daoqi,

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.840
President, Dr. Fu Limited.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:32.800
Good enough?

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.480
Perfect.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.960
BUSINESS CASUAL!

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.160
Enough videos.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:59.160
Always on

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.240
that phone.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:05.680
Mom.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.320
C'mon!

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.680
Come here, quick!

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.000
Alright, alright.

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.120
Over here!

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.600
C'mon!

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:14.960
1, 2, 3,

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.240
-Happy Birthday! -Welcome...

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:18.000
wait...

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:21.000
Happy Birthday! Yay!

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:22.680
Heart signs, remember?

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.120
Hearts!

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:24.920
Hearts!

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.840
From TV...

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:29.960
what's it...Party...

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:30.840
Yeah...

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:31.920
Hearts,

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.400
young people's style,

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:34.040
right?

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:34.960
Yes...thanks.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.080
I'm home!

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.240
Coming!

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.960
Fu Yudong here?

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.080
Right here.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:44.680
Sweet party...

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.040
Dad, Mom!

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:46.840
So,

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.880
everyone's acquainted?

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:49.800
Yeah, yeah.

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:51.440
Your mom's wonderful.

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:52.600
Nice party, sit!

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:53.280
Move along,

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.080
don't hover.

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.040
Here, man,

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:55.920
this seat.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.240
Please!

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:58.320
No formalities.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.040
We're all family.

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.080
Dad, this side,

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:00.920
here.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:01.840
This spot's fine.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.000
Sure, sure.

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:03.800
OK, I'm here.

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:04.280
I'll take this.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:04.880
Elders first.

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.680
Yudong, here.

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:07.680
Need to wash up.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:08.920
Mom, that spot.

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:09.920
This works.

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:11.280
Please, everyone.

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:12.960
Sit.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:13.960
OK,

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:16.440
I'm center.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.440
Everything's perfect.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:22.800
Shrimp?

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:23.920
Dig in!

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:24.920
Yudong, eat!

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.760
You won't believe

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.200
how famous I am

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:30.320
in our neighborhood!

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.120
First thought neighbors

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.080
were greeting me,

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:34.720
but no!

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.000
Everyone asks about him!

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:38.880
Yeah.

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.320
Better than

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.560
maintenance staff,

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:42.480
seriously!

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:43.320
Yeah!

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.120
Announcement,

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.680
he's retiring from

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:47.960
repairs.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.320
He and Li Daoqi

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.760
started...

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.640
what's it called...

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.720
he's a CEO now!

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:54.360
With his

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.680
chemistry background,

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.080
they're doing cosmetics.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:57.840
No more

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.560
Yudong, the handyman.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.960
Now he's Mr. Fu, the CEO!

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.120
They should know,

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.000
it's huge!

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.240
With Li Daoqi?

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:08.080
Toast time!

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.000
Congrats!

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:09.560
To our CEO!

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:10.600
C'mon, Yudong!

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.560
Mr. Fu!

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:15.840
First round!

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:16.320
Cheers!

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.240
Drink up.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.800
She oversold it.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:19.640
Startups

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.520
can succeed

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.600
or fail.

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:23.760
Have a drink!

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:24.560
Success isn't everything.

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:25.800
You'll make it!

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.320
Will succeed!

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:28.960
Just

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:30.440
do your best!

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:31.520
Proud of you!

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:33.760
Eat up,

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:34.320
let them speak.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.080
Right, right.

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:35.720
Dear parents,

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:36.840
another toast.

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.960
Since he's shy,

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.200
I'll speak.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.560
On his birthday,

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.200
thanks for coming

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:44.560
all the way here.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.080
Sorry we're late,

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.360
thank you

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:48.920
for the surprise!

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.040
Thanks!

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:51.400
You can

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.680
count on us

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:53.520
to look after you.

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:54.960
Wishing you health

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:55.800
and fortune,

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:56.680
yes?

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:58.320
Your health means

00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:58.960
everything!

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:03.240
♪Wonder if the horizon♪

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.600
♪has an end...♪

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:06.480
Living room's done,

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.480
trash gone.

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:08.360
Perfect!

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.080
Quick, help choose

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:12.760
one,

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.000
a party photo.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.480
No smiles from you,

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.520
babe.

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:23.920
Need to talk.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.440
Birthday treat?

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.120
Roger, into the shower!

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:34.760
This is serious.

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.000
I mean it.

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:44.800
What?

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:47.320
I'm grateful for

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:48.679
the surprise party,

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:49.520
really.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.880
But truthfully...

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.280
I didn't enjoy it.

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:56.920
Just...

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:57.800
why were there suddenly

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:58.640
so many people?

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:00.600
Many people?

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.120
Just our parents

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.240
and us.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:03.880
Who else?

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:04.880
That's my point.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:06.960
That video about

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.200
Chinese father-son relationships,

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.320
I watched it.

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.520
People may say

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.520
create more communication.

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:14.720
You meant well.

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:15.480
I get it.

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:17.800
It might

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.720
work for others,

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.040
but

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:20.520
I'm different.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.680
My case is different.

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.840
How different?

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.320
He's your father!

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.680
What's

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:26.800
the big issue?

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:27.920
I don't get it.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.120
Can you explain?

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:30.400
I and him...

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.960
I know how to handle it.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.480
Got a plan.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:34.520
What plan?

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.200
Tell me.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.240
Tell me about it.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.640
Look,

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.120
we're back now.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.560
You can't avoid

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.080
him, right?

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:54.640
If you must see him,

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:56.400
why not make it pleasant?

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.120
So you're saying

00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.760
I messed up?

00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.520
Not about blame.

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.840
Let's skip who's right or wrong,

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.160
and others' comments

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.320
online.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.200
I'm just sharing

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:05.120
my honest feelings,

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.680
I felt awkward!

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:07.360
Unhappy.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.480
Don't like it.

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:08.920
Why...

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:09.800
Point is,

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.320
whatever you're planning,

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:11.920
please

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:13.000
talk with me

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:13.920
first!

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:14.760
Especially

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.080
about him!

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.200
Fine!

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:26.680
Tried helping, got rejected.

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.120
My fault for meddling,

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:28.600
alright?

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.080
Sorry, my bad!

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:30.920
My fault!

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:31.960
Sorry, Dr. Fu!

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.560
Won't happen again!

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:35.960
I'm stupid!

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:36.880
Moron!

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:42.880
No shower?

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.120
No! Never again!

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:45.680
Stay stinky!

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.120
Stink you out!

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.400
Was all good,

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.400
why this madness!

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.400
You startled me!

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:53.960
Drinking?

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:54.880
With whom?

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.480
Listen here,

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:56.760
no drinking with Uncle Fu,

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:57.880
he's got live issues...

00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:58.880
Wasn't him.

00:37:58.880 --> 00:37:59.600
Got something good.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:00.720
Eyes open.

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.000
Still meditating...

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:02.920
Open up.

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:04.400
Shower!

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.680
You reek.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:06.680
Shoo!

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:07.920
Open up.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:08.840
Won't.

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:10.920
Check it out.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:11.680
What?

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.000
Can't read it.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:13.920
What's this?

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.240
New job?

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.480
Which company?

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:21.400
Read.

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:22.520
"Dr. Fu?"

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:24.520
Yudong's company?

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.240
He's starting up?

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.680
You're president?

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:36.160
Technically, me, your darling

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.880
brought him in. Handled everything,

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.200
investments,

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:45.520
registration,

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.280
all me!

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.880
My office

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.040
is ready,

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:51.840
gorgeous.

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:53.520
Tomorrow morning,

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.160
showing you and Nian

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:56.440
around.

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:57.520
You?

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:58.760
Startup?

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:00.840
Legal rep?

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.120
49% shares?

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.600
Why would they

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.080
give you that much?

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.760
Everyone knows?

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:11.680
Explain!

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:12.640
I wanted

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:13.600
51%,

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:14.520
can't happen!

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.320
They wanted control!

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.120
Didn't mean to hide it...

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.880
Knew you'd

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:10.360
say no.

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.400
My age,

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.240
nothing to show.

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:21.120
Dining with

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:21.960
your friends,

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.120
introducing

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.600
myself...

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.720
I'm embarrassed!

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:32.840
Might be

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:34.200
my final shot.

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.280
Had to try.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.880
Maybe it'll work?

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.640
Truth is, I'm scared.

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:46.960
Really.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.520
Just wanted your support.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.440
If you're against it,

00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.760
I'll go tomorrow,

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:00.840
pull out,

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:02.440
end it...

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:04.720
[Amanda,]

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.760
[ridiculous!]

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.000
[A younger man?]

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.680
[Six years younger.]

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.760
[Can you handle him?]

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.600
[Be realistic!]

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:16.280
[Yeah,]

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.520
[think ahead.]

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.600
[Close now,]

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.840
[but later when you age]

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:24.880
[and he's still young...]

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:26.880
[What will you be to him,]

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.080
[wife or mother?]

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:32.120
[Sis, open your eyes.]

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:35.040
[He wants a sugar mama.]

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:36.360
[He'll spend your money]

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.920
[and leave you!]

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:01.600
[To conclude,]

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:03.640
[accept kindness.]

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:04.840
[Offering it]

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.160
[takes courage.]

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:09.000
[That's all for today,]

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:09.840
[thanks!]

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:19.720
So focused on

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:20.880
someone being a CEO.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:21.520
Oops,

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:22.600
made extra breakfast

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.320
without asking.

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.840
Annoying him again.

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:26.560
My fault.

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:27.400
Taking back.

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.600
Must take it back.

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:29.240
Dumbass,

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:30.360
zero

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.240
sense,

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:33.040
complete loser,

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:33.760
just

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.560
annoying him!

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:40.880
Lousy startup!

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:41.600
Big shot!

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:42.840
Mr. CEO getting cocky,

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:43.320
huh?

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.960
Acting all mighty!

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:48.280
Running late.

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:49.480
OK,

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.360
for the road.

00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:58.760
Thanks!

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:00.040
Bang!

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:01.080
Shoes done.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:02.240
Saw it.

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:03.240
Love you!
