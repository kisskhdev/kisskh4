WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.392
Did you happen to have seen

00:00:01.416 --> 00:00:02.992
who hurt Picha?

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.040
Bua

00:00:04.072 --> 00:00:05.880
Chat was there when it happened?

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.280
The one who told Dad about this secret

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.864
must have been one of the three of us.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.648
I destroyed all the evidence for you.

00:00:13.672 --> 00:00:16.520
your life is now in my hands.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.448
It is expected that the manufacturer
will triple its orchid orders, Dad.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.936
You have such a sharp vision

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.528
for steering the company in this direction.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.384
Then we might have to expand our farm.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.248
I thought about that.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.200
It’s in the next file.

00:00:49.224 --> 00:00:50.184
You can have a read.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.936
And…

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.976
May I present this at the meeting?

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.368
Yes.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.744
You’ve become much better.

00:00:59.432 --> 00:01:01.430
You learn to plan for the long run.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.968
Look at Bua as an example.

00:01:06.672 --> 00:01:08.670
You guys will have to be like her one day.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.264
Because one day,

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.000
everything I have will become yours.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.808
If we’re only going to talk about business,

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.072
then this shouldn’t be called a family dinner.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.360
It should be called a meeting.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.072
Business and family

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.568
are the same thing.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.176
That’s true.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.872
I forgot.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.328
That’s what our family always does.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.312
We never care about feelings.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.600
We only care about benefits.

00:01:49.808 --> 00:01:50.744
Chompoo.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.176
We don’t get to be all together like this very often.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.256
I’m begging you, just for today.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.496
Don’t stir any drama.

00:02:03.136 --> 00:02:04.240
Drama?

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.176
Who was the one

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.600
that made me not want to come home?

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.480
If you want to cut ties with me over Nathat

00:02:16.512 --> 00:02:17.496
then so be it.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.424
But you can’t cut ties with this family.

00:02:20.456 --> 00:02:21.544
I’m so sorry.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.560
Fine.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.008
If everyone’s going to act
like nothing’s happened

00:02:28.032 --> 00:02:29.720
and want me to back down,

00:02:29.752 --> 00:02:31.152
then I’ll back down.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.984
But don’t force me

00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:37.440
to feel or not to feel a certain way.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.144
If everyone’s going to be this fake,

00:02:40.168 --> 00:02:41.480
then go ahead!

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:43.168
But don’t count me in.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.896
Chom!

00:02:45.936 --> 00:02:46.736
What?

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.040
You can’t accept the truth when I say it?

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.880
Chompoo.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.032
Get back to your seat.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.360
I’ve never expected you guys to be good parents.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.704
But at least,

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.144
can you pretend to love your children?

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.936
You missed, Dad.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:29.976
Enough!

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.736
I’ve never thought a man could turn you so insane

00:03:34.776 --> 00:03:36.512
that you can’t tell what’s right or wrong.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.096
What about you?

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.568
Do you know what’s right or wrong?

00:03:57.072 --> 00:03:59.070
(Reacting with emotions )

00:03:59.536 --> 00:04:01.540
(can be more powerful than you think.)

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.808
You shouldn’t lecture me on that.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.920
You’re not so good at holding yourself back either.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.472
(It can turn a situation)

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.360
(from good)

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.760
(to bad.)

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.176
(Or even ruin a person’s life.)

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.912
An engineer at a flower farm
was killed in an accident.
- It’s not an accident!

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.816
Your dad

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.408
killed him.

00:04:56.808 --> 00:04:58.768
I gave Mom some sleeping pills.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.624
She’ll probably wake up tomorrow around noon.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.296
You and the other sisters already knew, right?

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.168
Knew what?

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.472
You know what I’m talking about.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.720
So what is it?

00:05:14.768 --> 00:05:16.248
Tell me what you’re talking about

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.584
so I can tell you

00:05:17.616 --> 00:05:19.184
whether I knew about it or not.

00:05:19.776 --> 00:05:21.424
The way Chom said it that day,

00:05:21.448 --> 00:05:23.536
you guys must have known, right?

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:28.752
Does that mean,

00:05:28.776 --> 00:05:30.552
you already knew?

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.304
Then you should tell me what you know first.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.680
It’s not important how much I know.

00:05:43.728 --> 00:05:46.488
What’s important is whether Dad is aware of it.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.040
What does this have to do with Dad?

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.056
Then tell me whether Dad knows!

00:05:52.672 --> 00:05:54.670
Dad knows about Mom, right?

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:01.760
Chat, if you don’t tell me what you know,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.776
I won’t tell you.

00:06:03.808 --> 00:06:05.352
(This is the reason why)

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.816
(you should think carefully before saying it.)

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.208
You don’t understand.

00:06:10.248 --> 00:06:12.880
Our family’s going to have nothing left.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.040
(To ensure that)

00:06:14.072 --> 00:06:15.784
(every word said)

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.936
(can actually kill someone alive.)

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.480
That day, Chatfah already told me everything

00:07:34.528 --> 00:07:35.928
but I didn’t understand.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:38.592
Had I figured it out earlier,

00:07:38.608 --> 00:07:40.400
things wouldn’t have turned out like this.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:47.304
Dad, Mom, and Uncle Kajorn wouldn’t have died.

00:07:48.792 --> 00:07:51.056
Chatfah wouldn’t have disappeared.

00:07:53.768 --> 00:07:55.770
Bua wouldn’t have become this way.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.888
Do you think your older sister

00:07:57.912 --> 00:07:59.576
is the one who made your younger sister disappear?

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.400
I don’t want to think that way

00:08:04.128 --> 00:08:06.776
but I can’t find any other reasons.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:11.952
Don’t think about anything anymore.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.360
You should rest.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.888
Tomorrow morning,

00:08:19.928 --> 00:08:22.144
police will come here to interview you.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:28.160
How can one live

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.008
when there’s no one else you can trust?

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.000
Just trust in yourself.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:44.480
The only one

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.104
who will never betray us

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.728
is ourselves.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.064
You still have me.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.544
So you’re not alone.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.096
Tell me.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:26.424
Who actually are you?

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:30.632
The engineer

00:09:31.432 --> 00:09:33.430
who died at your farm

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:38.536
was my father.

00:09:41.032 --> 00:09:43.030
He wasn’t just an employee.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.904
But he’s also my Mom’s lover.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:56.568
Are you here to take revenge on us?

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.360
I don’t want revenge.

00:10:04.536 --> 00:10:06.540
I want to know the truth.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.056
Whether it’s actually

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.760
like what Chatfah suspected.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:14.864
Chatfah suspected that

00:10:14.888 --> 00:10:16.488
your father’s death

00:10:18.288 --> 00:10:20.290
was because of my dad?

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:23.944
Try and admit the truth for once.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.264
Deep down inside,

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.952
you also believe so.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:41.128
I admit that my dad might not be the best person.

00:10:43.168 --> 00:10:46.104
But he’s not so horrible as to kill a man.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.760
Are you sure

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.496
that you know your dad well?

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:57.560
But

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.120
the investigation concluded that

00:11:00.144 --> 00:11:01.664
it was an accident.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:05.408
Was it an accident

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:10.072
or was it a setup

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:12.240
to make it seem like an accident?

00:11:15.344 --> 00:11:17.340
I want you to fix

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.224
the chemical treatment system

00:11:20.272 --> 00:11:22.584
which has always been an issue for our farm.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.408
You have to go into the chemical storage room

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.416
at the back of the farm.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.608
But that room has been locked away long ago.

00:11:35.648 --> 00:11:37.610
Ever since someone died there.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.456
He’s the one who laid out the system from the start.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:44.240
So he should know it better than anyone.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:46.328
After that incident,

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.848
I’ve already taken the responsibility

00:11:48.872 --> 00:11:49.990
Then this time,

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:52.768
Then this time,

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.064
you must fix it properly.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.368
Yes, sir.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.472
It’s a great loss for our company

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:05.624
since Mr. Chatchai is an important engineer for us.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:07.176
And is it true that he’s the cause

00:12:07.208 --> 00:12:09.160
for the chemical spill

00:12:09.192 --> 00:12:11.200
that the company is being criticized for?

00:12:11.232 --> 00:12:12.656
Where did you get that news?

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.080
Is the source reliable?

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.584
A dead man can’t speak for himself.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.368
Before you accuse him that way,

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.400
have you thought about his family

00:12:22.424 --> 00:12:23.944
and how they would feel?

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:26.928
You intentionally took him in again

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.208
to kill him.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.928
Why should I kill him?

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.384
What crime did he commit?

00:12:45.992 --> 00:12:46.568
Hmm?

00:12:48.248 --> 00:12:49.552
You tell me.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.032
What did he do

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.440
that I had to kill him?

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.440
Don’t cry so much.

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.944
People would get the wrong idea

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.144
that the dead man

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.176
was your husband

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.368
and not an employee.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:36.000
Mom.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.336
Remember.

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:49.176
Never trust anyone,

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.536
except yourself.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:54.528
Never trust anyone,

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.672
especially

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.760
the people in this house.

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:00.664
Got it?

00:14:02.792 --> 00:14:04.272
Do you understand?

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.880
You knew everything, right?

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.536
We’ve been married for a long time.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:41.968
Do you think I wouldn’t know

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:49.824
what kind of person you are?

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:56.848
We have been married for a long time.

00:14:57.970 --> 00:14:59.448
Of course, you would know

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.328
what kind of person I am.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.920
But you still don’t know me well enough.

00:15:43.184 --> 00:15:44.024
Mom!

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.008
What are you doing?

00:15:48.344 --> 00:15:49.456
That watch.

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:50.896
Keep it.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.168
Don’t give it to anyone.

00:15:55.768 --> 00:15:57.216
I’m sorry.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:15:59.824
No!

00:15:59.848 --> 00:16:00.368
No!

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.176
No!

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:08.504
Mom!

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.472
Mom!

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.080
My family is like

00:16:40.112 --> 00:16:41.960
it’s been cursed.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.568
Are there any other families

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.368
that siblings, father, and mother

00:16:47.392 --> 00:16:48.376
kill one another like this?

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:52.192
I used to think

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:55.752
that I was so damn lucky

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.976
to be born into a rich family.

00:16:58.390 --> 00:16:59.816
A famous one.

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.360
Everyone wants to have my last name.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:08.256
But does it have to come with this much loss?

00:17:15.144 --> 00:17:16.600
There’s nothing worse

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.760
than being hurt

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.120
by someone who’s supposed to love you.

00:17:39.216 --> 00:17:40.336
Do you know

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.384
what riles me up the most?

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.808
It’s me.

00:17:52.792 --> 00:17:54.790
I’m so selfish.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.000
Only focusing on myself.

00:18:01.176 --> 00:18:03.180
Only thinking about myself.

00:18:03.504 --> 00:18:05.976
And ignored those little cracks.

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:08.432
And today…

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.320
Everything has broken down.

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:18.456
I freaking failed at everything.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.272
As a leader of the family.

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:24.320
As an older sister.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.648
As a daughter.

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:29.344
I freaking suck.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.856
My dad often says that

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.936
what will always haunt you

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.928
is not the mistakes you did

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:54.128
but the results of the actions

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:57.560
that impacts you and the others.

00:19:01.304 --> 00:19:02.920
Stop blaming yourself.

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.984
You can’t fix it anyway.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.288
Everything happened

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.920
even before you could do anything.

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:39.776
My mom had been

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.648
having an affair with your dad for a long time, right?

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:50.024
The reason why my mom often went to America

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:52.856
was to meet your dad, right?

00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:59.112
And you…

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:01.160
met Chat there.

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:04.136
Yes.

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:11.096
That’s funny.

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:13.664
The parents had an affair

00:20:13.696 --> 00:20:15.096
while the kids fell in love with each other.

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.264
Life’s just funny like that.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.760
So you don’t have to stress over it.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:35.016
You can dwell in sadness

00:20:35.056 --> 00:20:36.336
but don’t take too long.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.496
Because you deserve to be happy.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:42.704
Me?

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.040
This me?

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.000
The one who ruined this family?

00:20:51.032 --> 00:20:52.190
I deserve to be happy?

00:20:55.176 --> 00:20:57.432
I don’t even know

00:20:57.472 --> 00:20:59.264
if I deserve to continue living.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.736
No one gets to dictate your life

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.456
except you.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.632
If you think

00:21:10.664 --> 00:21:13.488
everything you’ve done was a mistake

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.240
then fix it and get it right.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.240
End the curse of your family.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.608
What should I do?

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:33.800
You have me right here.

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:39.544
I’ll help you find out the whole truth.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.800
Aunty Chom.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:09.728
Aunty Chom, where are you?

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:11.944
Aunty Chom?

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:13.736
Aunty Chom?

00:23:22.504 --> 00:23:23.712
Aunty Chom?

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:26.968
Aunty Chom?

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:37.176
Mr. Chain.

00:23:40.392 --> 00:23:42.816
I’m sorry I let myself in.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.552
I happened to drive by a famous porridge place

00:23:46.576 --> 00:23:47.560
so I got a take-out for you.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:49.560
Porridge?

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.544
I figured you live alone, so I was worried.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.120
The police have increased the manpower

00:23:54.152 --> 00:23:55.880
but it’s still not enough.

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:02.568
Oh, I forgot you have a maid.

00:24:02.592 --> 00:24:04.072
You must have already eaten.

00:24:04.088 --> 00:24:05.288
Then, it’s fine.

00:24:05.312 --> 00:24:06.344
I can take this home.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.512
It’s okay.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.336
Aunty Chom has been missing since the afternoon.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.088
She must have gone out for groceries
and hasn’t returned.

00:24:12.128 --> 00:24:13.560
I was getting hungry.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:16.424
Here you go.

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.008
Thank you.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.176
If it weren’t because of you,

00:24:20.208 --> 00:24:21.584
I would have to cook some instant noodles.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.488
It’s totally alright.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.968
Then shall we…

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:29.800
exchange numbers?

00:24:29.856 --> 00:24:31.472
Just in case there’s anything,

00:24:31.496 --> 00:24:32.640
you can just contact me directly.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:33.768
Yes?

00:24:33.792 --> 00:24:34.424
Yes?

00:24:42.216 --> 00:24:45.672
PARN.

00:24:49.152 --> 00:24:50.584
I’ve just scolded Khem on this.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.808
Did I become one just like him?

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:28.016
[I’m sorry I couldn’t tell you in person.]

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:30.024
[I am quitting]

00:25:30.056 --> 00:25:32.672
[because I can no longer work in a house]

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:38.232
[that is filled with the death
of my beloved boss.]

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.056
[I hope you understand.]

00:25:41.088 --> 00:25:43.984
[Take care, Miss Parn.]

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.536
She quit?

00:25:54.568 --> 00:25:56.136
Without any words?

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.120
(That’s all that was written in the letter.)

00:26:00.304 --> 00:26:02.300
Yeah, Aunty Chom is probably sad.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:03.520
Just let her go.

00:26:03.544 --> 00:26:06.552
I’ll get you a new maid and caregiver.

00:26:06.592 --> 00:26:07.864
Are you okay with living alone?

00:26:07.888 --> 00:26:09.248
Do you want me to come over?

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.256
(It’s alright, I’m fine alone.)

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.080
Okay.

00:26:13.104 --> 00:26:14.888
Then I’ll get back to work.

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:17.728
Let go of me!

00:26:17.776 --> 00:26:19.152
Let go of me!

00:26:19.176 --> 00:26:20.816
Why are you capturing me?!

00:26:21.304 --> 00:26:22.328
Damn you people!

00:26:22.352 --> 00:26:23.000
Damn you!

00:26:23.032 --> 00:26:23.712
Let go!

00:26:23.744 --> 00:26:24.160
Let go!

00:26:24.184 --> 00:26:24.880
Let go!

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.400
Who are you guys?!

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.152
Damn you!

00:26:27.176 --> 00:26:27.848
Damn you!

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:28.832
Damn you!

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:30.200
Hey!

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.024
Who are you guys?

00:26:38.048 --> 00:26:39.688
Why are you capturing me?!

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.920
You don’t have to know.

00:26:40.952 --> 00:26:42.744
Just know that you’re fired.

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:45.896
Get lost and never come back.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.120
Not unless you want to die.

00:27:04.952 --> 00:27:06.256
It’s taken care of.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.848
Would that be enough?

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:12.464
What if she comes back?

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:14.312
No matter how much of a psycho she is,

00:27:14.336 --> 00:27:16.110
I think she probably still fears death.

00:27:16.824 --> 00:27:19.160
She has also worked for my family
for a long time.

00:27:19.856 --> 00:27:22.616
I don’t want to go further even if I could.

00:27:29.224 --> 00:27:30.672
This is the best solution.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:32.680
If you have anything for me to help

00:27:32.712 --> 00:27:33.784
then just let me know.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:35.960
Yeah.

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:45.128
Ouch!

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:52.280
Are you okay?

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:54.856
It’s nothing big.

00:27:54.888 --> 00:27:55.752
I’m alright.

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.560
Are you thinking about Bua?

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:11.952
Yeah.

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:16.088
I have been thinking about that all night, too.

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:18.376
I couldn’t sleep.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:22.088
I’m sorry

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.432
I haven’t been here to take care of you

00:28:23.464 --> 00:28:25.160
and had to make Captain do it instead.

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:28.752
I told him everything.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.376
How much is ‘everything’?

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.432
Don’t worry.

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:37.368
I didn’t mention anything about you.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.304
I just told him about our family

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.160
and about Dad and Mom.

00:28:47.752 --> 00:28:49.750
But there’s one thing

00:28:50.488 --> 00:28:52.490
that I’ve never asked you.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.584
What is it?

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.368
Were you the one who told Dad

00:28:56.408 --> 00:28:57.920
who Mom’s affair partner was?

00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:10.216
I didn’t tell him.

00:29:11.816 --> 00:29:13.820
I had no intention of doing that either.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.584
I didn’t tell him either.

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:18.928
But I believe you.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:21.752
There’s no reason for you to do that.

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:26.712
Then there’s only one suspect left.

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:29.328
Do you mean Bua?

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.424
I don’t know.

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:41.624
Bua!

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.024
For the case of Dad and Mom,

00:29:48.088 --> 00:29:50.240
I’m not sure about the motivation.

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.688
But for the cases of Chatfah and Uncle Kajorn,

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:56.512
we both know the reason.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:07.616
Excuse me.

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:13.696
A flower delivery for Miss Pudpichaya.

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:18.616
Did you tell anyone you were hospitalized?

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.304
I didn’t tell anyone.

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:30.792
IF YOUR SIBLINGS CAN’T BE TRUSTED,
WHY DON’T YOU HAVE THEM ALL DEAD?
SO YOU CAN BE THE ONE AND ONLY FAVORITE CHILD.

00:30:32.192 --> 00:30:33.224
Does it hurt?

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.512
Miss Nurse,

00:30:35.552 --> 00:30:37.510
who was the one who sent this flower?

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:53.952
Hello.

00:30:53.984 --> 00:30:54.824
Hello.

00:30:54.864 --> 00:30:57.408
I’m the sister of the one who received the flower.

00:30:57.448 --> 00:30:58.496
I made a call.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.632
I’m truly sorry.

00:31:00.656 --> 00:31:01.840
The client said

00:31:01.864 --> 00:31:03.192
she was pulling a prank on her friend.

00:31:03.216 --> 00:31:05.808
I didn’t know it was an actual threat.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:09.400
Do you have the information about the sender?

00:31:09.432 --> 00:31:10.360
What’s the name?

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:12.288
She didn’t tell us her name.

00:31:12.328 --> 00:31:14.008
I only know she’s a woman.

00:31:14.672 --> 00:31:15.560
A woman?

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.192
Yes.

00:31:17.232 --> 00:31:18.904
Would you like to check the CCTV?

00:31:18.928 --> 00:31:19.440
Yes.

00:31:19.464 --> 00:31:20.816
Just a moment.

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:32.848
Excuse me.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.792
Is this the one?

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:37.168
May I?

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:39.704
Probably yes.

00:31:43.192 --> 00:31:45.832
Are you sure it’s really her?

00:31:46.608 --> 00:31:48.610
I meant this person.

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:58.744
Here’s the video from the CCTV.

00:32:30.976 --> 00:32:31.680
About…

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:35.968
About last night.

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.968
I…

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:40.760
You what?

00:32:43.496 --> 00:32:44.544
I think

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:48.272
we were both drunk

00:32:49.296 --> 00:32:50.384
so can you

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.600
pretend nothing happened?

00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:58.448
The thing is…

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:02.568
Last night I…

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.512
I got carried away because

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:06.896
I couldn’t think straight

00:33:06.928 --> 00:33:08.192
because of the things about my family.

00:33:09.088 --> 00:33:10.272
You couldn’t think straight?

00:33:10.992 --> 00:33:12.990
So you ended up sleeping with me?

00:33:17.696 --> 00:33:19.700
If I had been in my right mind,

00:33:20.216 --> 00:33:22.220
I wouldn’t have taken my sister’s man.

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:25.232
Fine.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.784
I will pretend nothing happened,

00:33:28.808 --> 00:33:29.968
as you wish.

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:32.880
But…

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.528
I still want us to work together

00:33:37.552 --> 00:33:39.576
to find out the truth.

00:33:42.024 --> 00:33:43.352
So,

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:47.640
if anything’s unimportant,

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:49.800
just forget about it.

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:53.136
Deal.

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:58.736
I have something to ask you.

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:06.848
Why did Chat give you that watch?

00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:09.632
As I told you.

00:34:09.656 --> 00:34:10.920
Your mom told her

00:34:10.952 --> 00:34:12.416
not to let the older sisters know.

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.360
You should ask yourself

00:34:14.408 --> 00:34:16.000
why your mom would’ve said that.

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:20.064
I tried to think, but nothing came to mind.

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:25.576
That watch must have more significance

00:34:26.248 --> 00:34:28.250
than its monetary value.

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:30.312
Of course.

00:34:32.424 --> 00:34:34.656
Because even your uncle wanted it.

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:38.000
Do you mean Uncle Kajorn?

00:34:39.856 --> 00:34:42.408
The reason why I ran into you that night

00:34:42.464 --> 00:34:43.728
was because of this.

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:55.416
How did you get it?

00:34:57.272 --> 00:34:59.270
I was there that day.

00:34:59.304 --> 00:35:00.848
The day Mom shot Dad.

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:04.280
I don’t know who to rely on.

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.392
The only person I could trust is you.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:08.800
What about your older sisters?

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.368
Can’t you tell them?

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.720
No one can be trusted.

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:17.936
Maybe they’re the ones who told Dad the truth.

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:21.520
I’m just curious.

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:24.440
Why did Mom ask me to keep it?

00:35:27.776 --> 00:35:29.780
Ever since it went missing,

00:35:29.824 --> 00:35:31.632
Uncle Kajorn has been looking for it.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:33.584
Uncle Kajorn?

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:35.976
Mr. Asok’s younger brother?

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:37.880
Yes.

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:40.816
She asked the maid to turn the house over

00:35:40.848 --> 00:35:42.600
to find this watch.

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:45.584
I think there has to be a reason

00:35:45.616 --> 00:35:46.976
but I don’t know how to investigate

00:35:47.008 --> 00:35:48.792
without Uncle Kajorn knowing that I have it.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.840
If he’s looking for it,

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.608
then let him find it.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.544
[Unknown: I have something you want.]

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:06.480
[K: How did you get it?]

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:08.488
[Unknown: You don’t have to know.]

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:11.144
[K: How can I be sure it’s the real one?]

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.704
[K: Let me see the back of it.]

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.216
[K: How much do you want?]

00:36:42.976 --> 00:36:44.696
Why is he not here yet?

00:37:08.424 --> 00:37:10.040
Where did he go?

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:02.864
That Uncle Kajorn of yours

00:38:02.888 --> 00:38:04.320
didn’t meet up with me that day

00:38:04.352 --> 00:38:07.656
because someone lured him into the woods.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.360
And that someone killed him.

00:38:12.312 --> 00:38:15.536
Then, can I see the watch?

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.608
There has to be something more to it.

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.920
Something that makes Uncle Kajorn want it.

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.560
Something that is a secret

00:38:51.384 --> 00:38:53.380
that even Mom didn’t want anyone to know.

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.760
Oh?

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:06.336
Hey.

00:39:06.376 --> 00:39:08.336
Is the watch broken?

00:39:08.368 --> 00:39:09.872
Why are the handles not moving?

00:39:09.896 --> 00:39:10.888
Open it up and see.

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:12.024
Hey!

00:39:12.064 --> 00:39:13.456
Are you going to open it up yourself?

00:39:13.488 --> 00:39:14.984
You’re not wearing any gloves.

00:39:15.008 --> 00:39:17.352
Do you know how much this watch is worth?

00:39:17.376 --> 00:39:18.240
Yeah.

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:19.728
And what are we going to do?

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:21.848
Do you want to have a shop open it for you?

00:39:22.152 --> 00:39:23.352
Do you want to tell everyone

00:39:23.376 --> 00:39:24.856
that we have this watch?

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:27.072
Then

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:29.960
do it carefully.

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:41.624
Hmm.

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.560
By the way.

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:49.168
The weight of this watch is odd.

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:51.360
It’s not like normal watches.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.080
What do you mean?

00:39:57.310 --> 00:39:59.928
Do you know what time your dad was born?

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:01.248
Why?

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:02.808
Are you going to check his horoscope?

00:40:02.848 --> 00:40:03.600
Yeah.

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:04.392
No!

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:07.536
When I was stealing gold,

00:40:08.128 --> 00:40:10.130
I used to come across these watches.

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:13.528
To open the back of it up,

00:40:13.576 --> 00:40:17.976
you have to turn the handles to specific numbers.

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.488
Like a password.

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:21.952
Then there will be a space

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:24.864
where you can open and hide small stuff.

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:28.768
Maybe,

00:40:29.656 --> 00:40:31.660
the thing that Uncle Kajorn wanted

00:40:31.696 --> 00:40:34.296
and your mom wanted to hide

00:40:34.336 --> 00:40:35.992
wasn’t just the watch

00:40:36.592 --> 00:40:38.590
but what is inside.

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:55.456
Parn, I have found you a new maid.

00:40:55.496 --> 00:40:57.560
She also has experience in patient care.

00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.560
I think she’s really good.

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:03.576
I’ll talk to you later, Parn.

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:06.024
Officer!

00:41:06.048 --> 00:41:06.816
Yes?

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:10.752
Are you the one who handles Sarah’s case?

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:12.320
Yes.

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:15.144
I’m Sarah’s friend.

00:41:15.168 --> 00:41:16.784
We met at the temple.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:20.288
I haven’t been in contact with Sarah’s Mom

00:41:20.336 --> 00:41:21.968
so I don’t know how the case has progressed.

00:41:22.032 --> 00:41:25.400
I’m actually here about that case.

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:28.264
The bystander has just woken up from a coma

00:41:28.296 --> 00:41:29.952
so I’m paying a visit.

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:33.008
I think the interrogation can start soon.

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:35.976
It’s a good thing.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.528
If we can get more interrogation done,

00:41:37.584 --> 00:41:39.112
then the case can be concluded soon.

00:41:39.792 --> 00:41:40.736
Yes.

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:41.528
If there’s nothing else

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:42.656
then I’ll excuse myself.

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:43.960
Yes.

00:41:58.280 --> 00:41:59.592
[Thana: Where are you?]

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:07.632
[Thana: Are you drunk?]

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:28.408
(Chom, where are you?)

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:31.440
At our usual place.

00:42:31.488 --> 00:42:32.568
(Our usual place?)

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.120
(That bar?)

00:42:34.512 --> 00:42:35.304
Yeah.

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:43.168
How much courage do you think it takes

00:42:43.208 --> 00:42:44.736
for a person to kill themselves?

00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:50.568
Fire!

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:57.568
(What are you talking about?)

00:42:58.980 --> 00:42:59.984
Nevermind.

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:02.832
You don’t have to understand.

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:07.264
(It’s those who decide to fight and live on)

00:43:07.296 --> 00:43:08.736
(who are courageous.)

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:11.432
(Listen to me, Chom.)

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.520
(If this world is actually fair,)

00:43:14.552 --> 00:43:17.136
(no one would have died out of hopelessness.)

00:43:17.176 --> 00:43:19.140
(So the ones who put up a fight)

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:21.160
(even when it’s hopeless)

00:43:21.208 --> 00:43:22.780
(are the true courageous ones.)

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:25.640
(No one wants to be a fool)

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:28.232
(who gets tricked by sweet words.)

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:33.224
(Picha hired me to send her a threatening message)
