WEBVTT

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:01.990
That watch.

00:00:02.016 --> 00:00:02.896
Keep it.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.024
Don’t give it to anyone.

00:00:04.048 --> 00:00:07.180
That watch must have more significance

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.128
than its monetary value.

00:00:09.192 --> 00:00:11.576
That Uncle Kajorn of yours
didn’t meet up with me that day

00:00:11.616 --> 00:00:14.936
because someone lured him into the woods.

00:00:14.968 --> 00:00:16.928
And that someone killed him.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.384
(The truth is…)

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.768
(humans can be scarier than ghosts or demons.)

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.432
I called the police.

00:01:25.456 --> 00:01:26.928
How is Chat?

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.040
Where is Chat?

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.560
(Ghosts and demons, )

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.344
(when they appear in front of us, )

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.968
(all they can do is scare us.)

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.464
(But those whom we trust, )

00:02:06.504 --> 00:02:08.880
(they might seem harmless.)

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.096
What is that?

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.670
Hey.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.968
It’s a piece of cloth.

00:02:19.992 --> 00:02:20.590
Cloth?

00:02:20.616 --> 00:02:21.616
What cloth?

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.224
Get it closer so we can see.

00:02:23.248 --> 00:02:24.248
Put it here.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.872
(The next thing you know, )

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.376
(you are either deceived into despair, )

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.608
(or you may turn into the next demon.)

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.448
Hey, hey!

00:02:37.464 --> 00:02:39.312
It’s a dead body.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.344
7 HOURS BEFORE THE BODY IS FOUND

00:03:58.184 --> 00:03:59.184
No.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.256
CHOMPOO’S BIRTHDAY 24.03
PICHA’S BIRTHDAY 07.25

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.460
Hey.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.288
Your guess might be wrong.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.664
We tried all the possible combinations.

00:04:12.408 --> 00:04:13.432
We still can’t open it.

00:04:13.776 --> 00:04:17.928
Then why did your mom want to hide it
if it was just an ordinary watch?

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.952
She didn’t want you and your sisters to have it.

00:04:20.976 --> 00:04:24.056
She also didn’t want it to fall into
the hands of the police and Uncle Kajorn.

00:04:25.176 --> 00:04:26.760
There’s only one way left.

00:04:26.792 --> 00:04:28.288
I need to break it.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.184
No.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.536
I can’t let you do that.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.664
Do you want to know the truth?

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.960
The truth is right in front of you.

00:04:42.224 --> 00:04:44.288
But you are afraid to open it.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.888
I will open it.

00:04:47.928 --> 00:04:48.928
But…

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.744
But this watch was very important to my dad.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.856
He is dead.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.968
I don’t know what to do.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.860
Fine.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.696
Open it if you want.

00:05:17.736 --> 00:05:18.944
You can use any method to open it.

00:05:18.968 --> 00:05:19.968
Do it.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.744
It might be the one way to save my family.

00:05:26.352 --> 00:05:28.400
It’s just a watch.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.440
I don’t care.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.800
Open it.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.184
Wait.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:48.980
Wait.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:50.216
What?

00:05:50.248 --> 00:05:51.368
Let me give it one last try.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.864
Picha’s time of birth.

00:06:38.136 --> 00:06:40.140
Are you a ghost and trying to scare me?

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.168
Whether you are a ghost or a human,

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.328
you never leave me alone.

00:06:49.104 --> 00:06:51.100
I’m just worried about you.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.000
You are not happy, right?

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.344
Why don’t you come with me?

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.320
The world of the dead is very peaceful.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.600
It’s not chaotic.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.256
You won’t have any sufferings.

00:07:10.976 --> 00:07:12.980
You did everything you could.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.920
You must be very tired.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.840
What are you waiting for?

00:07:23.792 --> 00:07:25.760
Come to live with me.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.736
My life isn’t perfect.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.320
Things turn out this way

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.160
because I chose it.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.664
If I could turn back time,

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:34.736
I would still do the same.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.416
I believe…

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.840
though my life is a mess,

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.464
there is someone out there…

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:52.984
who tries to do everything to get to where I am.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.656
You too.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:09.152
You once said you wanted to be me.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.736
If this is the end of my life,

00:09:16.824 --> 00:09:18.740
why don’t I fight for it?

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:24.192
Why don’t I fight for myself and be proud of it?

00:09:38.208 --> 00:09:39.584
It’s you.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.168
You always run away.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:58.056
You run away from your life.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.776
Because you want to be someone else.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:03.940
Chat.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.360
When will you stop playing hide and seek?

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.240
Just come out and tell everyone the truth.

00:10:11.264 --> 00:10:15.184
It’s you who sent the flower basket to threaten us.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:20.576
You are also behind all the disasters
that happened to us.

00:10:22.176 --> 00:10:25.288
Why did you orchestrate your missing, Chat?

00:10:25.312 --> 00:10:26.760
I don’t get it.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.560
Why did you do that?

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.016
Chat.

00:10:33.072 --> 00:10:33.904
Chat.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:35.030
Chat.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.136
Chat, answer me.

00:10:37.144 --> 00:10:38.144
Chat.

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:01.730
Chom.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.320
Chom.

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:11.160
No, I want to talk to Chat.

00:11:11.168 --> 00:11:12.280
Talk to whom?

00:11:12.312 --> 00:11:13.072
Chat.

00:11:13.088 --> 00:11:15.136
She was right here.

00:11:15.168 --> 00:11:16.024
Let me go.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.256
Chom, you are drunk.

00:11:18.288 --> 00:11:20.296
No, let me go.

00:11:20.328 --> 00:11:21.904
I’ll talk to Chat.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.376
Chom, I’ll give you a ride home.

00:11:25.408 --> 00:11:26.408
I don’t want to go yet.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.232
I need to talk to Chat.

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:29.570
Chom.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.456
You are delusional.

00:11:31.488 --> 00:11:32.888
Chat went missing.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.160
We still can’t find her.

00:11:34.184 --> 00:11:35.328
It’s not true.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.560
She was right there.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:39.384
Chat never went missing.

00:11:39.408 --> 00:11:40.636
She has been with us all this time.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:43.088
She has been haunting us
and ruining our lives.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:43.776
Chom.

00:11:43.792 --> 00:11:44.792
Stop it!

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.184
Chat went missing for a while.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.560
Stop blaming her.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.272
She might start this chaos.

00:11:53.312 --> 00:11:55.544
But we all play a part in this disaster.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.312
We are blaming each other,
and things get messy.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.144
It’s too late…

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:12.280
to fix anything.

00:12:14.728 --> 00:12:16.688
I agreed to marry Chatfah,

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.184
because she had the video
from your birthday party.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:26.470
The night that the nightclub burned down.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.208
She used it to blackmail you?

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.376
Why didn’t you tell me?

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:41.232
I didn’t know what else she would do to you.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.360
I wanted to set you free from it.

00:12:46.112 --> 00:12:48.110
The result was worse than I thought.

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.096
I tried to protect everyone.

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:59.648
But I ended up hurting everyone.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.496
Have you ever seen this before?

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.040
No.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:35.760
Never.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:40.160
I think this is the plan of the secret basement
at your flower farm.

00:13:46.096 --> 00:13:47.328
Do you think…

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:53.080
the secret basement has something to do
with everything that happened?

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:04.640
Mrs. Pimol.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.880
Miss Picha is having a seizure again.

00:14:15.528 --> 00:14:16.528
Picha, sweetie.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:23.070
Picha!

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:28.096
Just let her lie here.

00:14:28.136 --> 00:14:29.344
She will get better soon.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.384
Where is Mr. Asok?

00:14:31.416 --> 00:14:33.160
He isn’t back yet.

00:14:33.184 --> 00:14:34.912
He attended a dinner gathering
with his employees.

00:14:34.936 --> 00:14:36.360
I’m going to a party, too.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.672
I’ll go get changed.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.360
What if Picha’s condition gets worse?

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:43.728
She will be fine.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.448
You just stay with her.

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.704
What if Mr. Asok asks?

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.016
Miss Picha is this sick.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.288
But you choose to go out.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.296
I need to tell him the truth.

00:14:58.590 --> 00:14:59.590
Fine.

00:15:00.008 --> 00:15:01.360
I won’t go.

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:04.048
I’ll go get a cold towel.

00:15:17.992 --> 00:15:19.176
It’s your fault.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:22.040
That’s why I'm stuck here.

00:15:44.248 --> 00:15:45.248
Picha.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.420
Are you okay?

00:15:47.944 --> 00:15:49.488
Why are you sweating?

00:15:50.448 --> 00:15:52.450
I just had a nightmare.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:57.740
Chom?

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.096
Where is she?

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.624
Can you call her for me?

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:12.620
Miss Picha.

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:14.912
You need to answer our questions.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.680
Pi.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:39.808
Is it really Chat?

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:43.160
Didn’t the police search the stream?

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.184
From what I heard,

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:48.080
her body was stuck
between the rocks under water?

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.608
It was raining hard the other night.

00:16:50.648 --> 00:16:52.008
So there was a landslide.

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:55.032
Her decayed body slipped out of it.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.920
It could be anyone.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.968
Anyone besides Chat.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.248
That’s what Chatfah wore
on the night she went missing.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.576
It’s just a dress.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.496
I don’t believe it.

00:17:36.528 --> 00:17:38.368
I met her last night.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.952
The CCTV footage that I found,

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.832
It showed that
Chat sent the flower to threaten us.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:48.424
There are other things as well.

00:17:48.728 --> 00:17:49.896
There’s no way it’s Chat.

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:54.290
No.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:56.656
It’s not true.

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:38.770
Hey.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:40.960
What’s wrong?

00:19:42.704 --> 00:19:44.360
I probably mistook it.

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.384
I’ll go get things ready.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:59.300
Hey.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.380
Have you been here long?

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.616
I came to help her.

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:04.760
I feel bad for her.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.400
She’s probably still in shock.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.904
Weren’t you transferred to work on another case?

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:14.160
Yes.

00:20:14.184 --> 00:20:15.368
But I’m not busy.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.060
Why?

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.840
I actually have something to tell you.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:26.464
(Picha hired me to send a threat to her.)

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.608
(She hired me to fake her hit-and-run accident.)

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:29.640
I...

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:32.536
- Khem.
- It’s about…

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.192
Can you help me carry things?

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:37.070
Yes.

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:38.712
I’ll talk to you later.

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:06.536
The police confirmed
that the body was Miss Chatfah.

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:11.672
Since she didn’t have
any offspring or living parents.

00:21:11.696 --> 00:21:17.976
So her next rightful heirs
are her biological sisters.

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:21.248
Can we talk about this
when Bua comes back?

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:22.800
Yes.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.752
It’s weird.

00:21:48.352 --> 00:21:50.350
When we didn’t receive anything from the will,

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.440
we questioned…

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.048
why we didn’t get anything.

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:01.056
But now we are getting everything,

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:03.944
we also question…

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.352
why we are receiving it.

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.152
Because it is traded off with our loss.

00:22:21.048 --> 00:22:23.050
If I could choose,

00:22:24.376 --> 00:22:26.380
I would choose to receive nothing.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.944
The only thing that I wanted,

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.120
I wanted our family to go back
to what we used to be.

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:38.280
I wished that everyone in our family
were together again.

00:22:40.168 --> 00:22:41.968
I don’t want to lose anyone again.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:50.776
Cousins.

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.120
I’ll go to Chat’s funeral first.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.208
I don’t want her to be alone.

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:03.248
Sure.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.712
Thank you so much.

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:17.968
What happened to your hand?

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:23.904
I helped our worker trim bushes.

00:23:25.448 --> 00:23:27.216
That’s how I got these scratches.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:31.552
Since Dad was gone,
no one told our worker to trim them.

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:34.640
Excuse me.

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:47.510
Yes.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.120
You held each other that night.

00:23:56.710 --> 00:24:00.320
The next morning, Chatfah’s body was found.

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.300
Do you know?

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:06.408
This will be great material
for the media to attack us.

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:09.712
Who sent them?

00:24:09.736 --> 00:24:10.768
You don’t need to know.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:15.384
What you should ask is
how these photos will be used?

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:18.560
Even if the photos are leaked to the media,

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:19.600
it’s okay.

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:21.848
I won’t run away anymore.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.576
I want to tell the truth.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:28.464
Even if it means I will be condemned
or criticized by the public, so be it.

00:24:28.488 --> 00:24:29.984
We cannot change what happened.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.832
You have been thinking this all this time, right?

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:38.344
You don’t care
who will be affected by your action.

00:24:39.432 --> 00:24:41.430
The effect of telling the truth,

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.864
it’s not as scary as the result of telling lies.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:45.130
So what?

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.120
You want me to do nothing
when your scandal is spreading…

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:53.520
that you and this brat conspired

00:24:53.552 --> 00:24:56.360
to kill your fiancé so you can be together?

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:58.816
Are you crazy?

00:24:58.856 --> 00:25:00.288
Are you out of your mind?

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:01.936
It’s not true.

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.168
We don’t need to be afraid of it.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.368
It’s true that we were together.

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.200
But we didn’t kill Chatfah.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.112
When the investigation is completed,

00:25:12.128 --> 00:25:13.672
we will find the real murderer.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.200
The public will know that we didn’t do it.

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.760
We didn’t do anything wrong.

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:24.952
We don’t need to be afraid.

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.928
Those who keep lying
and running away from the truth,

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.744
They are the ones who should be afraid.

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:38.080
You’ve lived for only a few decades.

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.728
How dare you think you know the world
better than me?

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:47.104
I will never stand by
and let you ruin my family’s reputation.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:51.056
If you feel embarrassed
that I used your family name,

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.952
I’ll change to my mom’s last name.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:58.840
You.

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:01.432
You said it yourself.

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:11.530
Is it hurt?

00:26:12.976 --> 00:26:14.696
Why did you say that?

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:16.760
I’m tired of it.

00:26:20.272 --> 00:26:22.270
I want to be happy now.

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:25.560
How can we be happy?

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:29.152
Who knows what secrets about your parents
your grandma might use to threaten you?

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:31.570
Don’t worry.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.024
All we need to do is find the murderer.

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:37.152
So my grandma will see you in a different light.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.672
There’s only a thin line

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.780
between being optimistic and being foolish.

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:50.360
I’m suspecting someone.

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:52.350
Who?

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:30.432
Miss Parn, are you okay?

00:27:30.456 --> 00:27:31.536
I’ll help you.

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:33.168
I’m okay.

00:27:33.192 --> 00:27:35.170
I just misstep.

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.232
What are you doing here?

00:27:42.248 --> 00:27:43.624
Why don’t you take a seat?

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:46.110
Pi.

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:47.928
What I’m about to tell you,

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:50.736
it might sound crazy.

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:52.928
Have you ever thought this?

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:56.896
The woman who pretended to be Chat
and sent the flower to threaten us.

00:27:57.264 --> 00:27:59.260
The person who tampered with your brake.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.800
The woman who encouraged me
to commit suicide.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.528
They could be someone close to us.

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.152
Chom, what are you trying to say?

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:11.008
I’m just thinking…

00:28:11.432 --> 00:28:13.430
the person who is the most likely culprit,

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:17.576
I think I know who that person is.

00:28:17.608 --> 00:28:18.608
Who?

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:20.816
Who do you think that person is?

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:22.450
I think…

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.304
Picha!

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:30.280
Do you think you can hide from me?

00:28:30.288 --> 00:28:31.712
Give me my money back, bitch!

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:34.024
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:28:34.048 --> 00:28:35.264
You’re drunk.

00:28:35.272 --> 00:28:36.336
Go away and leave my sister alone.

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:40.160
Your sister hired me to send her a threat.

00:28:40.184 --> 00:28:42.504
She also hired me
to fake her hit-and-run accident.

00:28:43.544 --> 00:28:45.540
She pretended to be a good girl.

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:47.944
She stole my pay.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.224
I got hit by a car and almost died.

00:28:50.232 --> 00:28:51.560
Where is my damn money?

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.580
What the hell are you talking about?

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:01.664
Why don’t you ask her if what I said is true?

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:03.624
What are you going to do, liar bitch?

00:29:03.656 --> 00:29:04.920
Give me my damn money.

00:29:04.928 --> 00:29:06.000
Give it to me.

00:29:06.032 --> 00:29:06.624
Calm down.

00:29:06.648 --> 00:29:08.080
What the hell?

00:29:08.096 --> 00:29:10.080
Give me my money.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.340
You can get it at the police station.

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:27.590
Picha.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.224
Is what he said true?

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.200
Yes and no.

00:29:41.768 --> 00:29:43.770
The threat note in my car,

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:46.264
I did it.

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:53.248
But I didn’t send the flower to threaten us.

00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:58.544
Why did you do that?

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:01.832
I’m sorry.

00:30:02.384 --> 00:30:03.600
What I did was wrong.

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:09.216
I was only thinking about
how to clear my name from being a suspect.

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:16.720
Did you hire him
to fake your hit-and-run accident?

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.320
Huh?

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:28.760
You staged the accident to fool us?

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:33.536
Bua and I were so damn worried about you.

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:39.576
But you used our trust to betray us?

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:43.144
Pi, you know what?

00:30:45.312 --> 00:30:47.310
You are not different from Chat.

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:58.056
Please don’t go.

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.456
Chom.

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:27.568
I heard about Picha.

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:31.688
I don’t get it.

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:37.152
When I thought
I had finally found someone I could trust,

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:41.304
I was always hit by the reality…

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:44.960
that I have no one I can trust.

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:51.536
Me.

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:55.184
I am someone…

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.120
you can trust.

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:04.800
What kind of trust do we share?

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:08.552
The trust based on our backroom deal?

00:32:09.528 --> 00:32:11.530
The trust comes from blackmailing each other?

00:32:13.568 --> 00:32:14.568
That…

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:18.240
The trust that…

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:22.128
I can do something for you that no one can.

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:26.272
Not even Nathat.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:29.792
It doesn’t matter anymore.

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:32.576
Things are coming to an end.

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:36.460
Sarah’s friend will gain consciousness soon.

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.264
Then the police will know

00:32:39.304 --> 00:32:41.784
that I started the fire at the nightclub.

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:49.392
Neither you nor Nathat can help me on this.

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:52.896
This is my fight.

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:01.000
What if…

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:03.704
I can help you?

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.264
If I can help you on this,

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:13.424
will l…

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.912
be ahead of Nathat?

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:23.672
Chompoo.

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.728
Are you going back to Bupphachat Mansion?

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.008
I need a ride home.

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:32.296
I’m not going back to the house.

00:33:32.328 --> 00:33:33.424
But I will give you a ride.

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:35.460
Alright.

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:04.768
Chompoo, did you talk to Picha
about the man at the funeral?

00:34:06.152 --> 00:34:07.152
Yes.

00:34:08.168 --> 00:34:10.170
She admits it’s true.

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:12.176
Really?

00:34:12.216 --> 00:34:15.072
Why did she stage the accident?

00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:18.256
I don’t know the details.

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:21.536
She was probably scared of being the suspect.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:23.760
That’s strange.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.560
If she didn’t do anything wrong,

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.560
why did she feel afraid of being a suspect?

00:34:28.390 --> 00:34:30.488
Although we grew up together,

00:34:30.528 --> 00:34:32.360
it doesn’t mean we know each other well.

00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:35.304
I recently realized that.

00:34:35.776 --> 00:34:37.780
Especially Chatfah.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:43.160
I can’t believe someone would want
to hurt a nice girl like her.

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:47.848
Parn, you know what?

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:49.712
You are the only one

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:51.680
who says only nice things about Chatfah.

00:34:52.424 --> 00:34:54.420
She was nice to me.

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:57.824
How are your legs?

00:34:58.410 --> 00:34:59.410
Can you get up?

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:02.368
No.

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.480
I can’t barely move them.

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.896
I just remember.

00:35:07.928 --> 00:35:09.384
I forgot something at the sermon hall.

00:35:09.408 --> 00:35:10.400
I’ll go get it.

00:35:10.408 --> 00:35:11.224
Parn, can you wait here?

00:35:11.256 --> 00:35:12.256
Yes.

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:28.880
Chom.

00:35:28.904 --> 00:35:30.104
Chom!

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.208
Miss Chompoo.

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:53.456
I saw you intentionally push
Parn’s wheelchair to the road.

00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:59.460
Are you accusing me?

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:03.752
I don’t know how you grew up.

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:07.360
If you hurt Parn again, I won’t let it slide.

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:12.584
Are you saying that as an officer
who works on our case or something else?

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:17.104
Whatever your relationship with her is,

00:36:17.136 --> 00:36:18.600
I want to warn you.

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:21.312
Don’t trust anyone in my family too much.

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:24.264
They might be fooling you right now.

00:36:43.024 --> 00:36:44.024
Khem.

00:36:46.224 --> 00:36:48.220
I sent a message to you.

00:36:48.256 --> 00:36:49.640
Did you see it?

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.328
I was busy all night.

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:52.856
It’s okay.

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:53.968
I understand.

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:57.100
I just want to tell you that
I came here for the police’s interview.

00:36:58.690 --> 00:36:59.690
Yes.

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.240
Khem.

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:07.776
If you don’t have any plans after work,

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:09.848
can you go and have dinner with me?

00:37:09.872 --> 00:37:11.408
I have something to tell you.

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:13.580
I’m sorry.

00:37:14.136 --> 00:37:16.140
But I don’t feel comfortable
meeting you anymore.

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:19.552
If it’s about that, I can explain it.

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:21.344
I don’t want to hear it.

00:37:21.936 --> 00:37:23.940
I don’t want to listen to your lies anymore.

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:26.700
Okay.

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:28.488
I admit it.

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:31.432
I admit that I lied about the threat.

00:37:32.448 --> 00:37:34.450
But not everything I told you is a lie.

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.768
My feelings for you are real.

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:42.071
Save it and tell the police.

00:37:42.072 --> 00:37:43.072
Don’t tell me.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:01.640
These are evidence and updates
about this case that I’ve gathered all night.

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:07.880
I promise that
my relationship with her has ended.

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.880
And I will stay away from her from now on.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.968
Please reassign me to the case, Inspector.

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:23.168
His conditions are improving.

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:26.184
He will be able to talk to you soon.

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:28.064
Thank you, Doctor.

00:38:28.088 --> 00:38:30.616
We need his testimony.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:34.336
This is a high-profile case.

00:38:34.384 --> 00:38:36.888
If you have any updates, please let me know.

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:37.960
Of course.

00:39:25.984 --> 00:39:27.288
Have a good sleep.

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:03.264
What is this?

00:41:33.816 --> 00:41:35.820
That’s Uncle Kajorn’s handwriting.

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:42.976
It looks like a chemical experiment record.

00:41:45.512 --> 00:41:47.510
He wanted the memory card in the watch.

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:50.184
Because he wanted to keep the secret
to himself.

00:41:56.608 --> 00:42:01.160
It looks like your company bought
a large amount of pesticide.

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:05.424
But it wasn’t only used
to control insects on your farm.

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:08.648
What was it used for?

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:26.488
They are materials
for producing low-quality drugs.

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:30.880
These are the drugs.

00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:35.368
This means…

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:37.700
Yes.

00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:43.568
It means your dad and uncle
opened the flower farm as a cover.

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:47.088
They hid a drug lab in it.

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:55.920
This is the list of major drug traffickers,

00:42:55.952 --> 00:42:58.736
who had been doing business with your dad
for a long time.

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:01.390
No wonder…

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:03.568
why your dad was so wealthy.

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.880
This is probably the drug lab.

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:15.864
Maybe the chemical leaked from our farm,

00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:20.344
it was used to produce drugs here.

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:47.752
Mr. Kajorn.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.144
What are you doing here?

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:50.944
Mr. Kajorn,

00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:54.192
is this the drug our workers are taking?

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:58.040
Did no one tell you
not to touch anything in this room?

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:00.472
No. I’m sorry.

00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:02.190
Wait.

00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:06.648
Put it back where you found it.

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:08.100
Yes.

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:19.592
Mr Kajorn, please open the door.

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:20.980
Mr. Kajorn.

00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:23.992
What is this smoke?

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:39.976
F*ck.

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:43.848
What the f*ck did my dad do?

00:44:44.432 --> 00:44:47.944
Did your mom know about this?

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:52.344
Of course, she knew.

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:56.360
Otherwise, she wouldn’t tell Chatfah
to keep the watch.

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:07.776
Today, I finished clearing the chemical storage.

00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:12.216
No traces of the med lab are left.

00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:15.552
Mr. Asok, please keep your promise.

00:45:16.616 --> 00:45:18.620
Please divorce Pimol.

00:45:40.792 --> 00:45:42.790
It was not an accident.

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:48.360
(Demons.)

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:53.176
(They might be something
that humans created.)

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:58.280
(So they can fool themselves
that they are scarier things than humans.)

00:46:10.450 --> 00:46:13.640
(Because they don’t want to admit
how evil they are.)

00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:17.592
Like I told you,

00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:22.712
I admit that I staged my accident
to make me look like a victim.

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:27.056
Today, I will tell you the truth about everything.

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:29.624
Then where shall we begin?

00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:34.168
The dream that has been haunting me
all this time.

00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:41.176
The body in the well.

00:46:42.784 --> 00:46:44.780
(But we forgot something.)

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:49.384
(We are the scariest thing.)

00:46:49.952 --> 00:46:51.192
I think…

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.944
she was murdered by my father.

00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:00.392
I think that it was the cause
of everything that happened.

00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:06.392
(Ghosts and demons can scare people.)

00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:12.470
Parn.

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:22.168
Parn, you killed Chat, didn’t you?

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:29.080
(But only humans are crazy enough
to lie to themselves.)

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:36.168
From our initial examination,

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:39.560
the blood on the scissors is confirmed to be Chatfah’s.

00:47:39.752 --> 00:47:41.896
Besides Chatfah’s fingerprints,

00:47:41.936 --> 00:47:44.832
we also found Chompoo’s fingerprints on it.

00:47:44.864 --> 00:47:48.000
Those who know best about the scissors are your family.

00:47:48.032 --> 00:47:51.088
Chompoo didn’t stab Chatfah. I can prove it.

00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:56.728
Go get your revenge in hell.
