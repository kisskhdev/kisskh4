Yum Jung-ah

00:00:11.918 --> 00:00:13.584
Won Jin-ah

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.876
Choi Young-joon

00:00:20.876 --> 00:00:21.959

The Defects

00:00:44.292 --> 00:00:46.834
Why is the dog barking?

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:54.125
You don't even greet your father?
You're worse than the dog.

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:58.042
H-H-Hello...

00:00:58.626 --> 00:01:02.500
Really, huh?
S-s-stuttering again?

00:01:02.542 --> 00:01:04.959
Where did this useless idiot come from?

00:01:09.626 --> 00:01:11.667
Why did you even adopt that thing?

00:01:12.375 --> 00:01:16.209
Who knew such a cute prince
would come into my life?

00:01:18.042 --> 00:01:19.083
Eat up.

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:06.999
You can't speak, and now,
you can't understand either?

00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:10.626
Didn't I tell you
to stay away from the kitchen?

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.042
Fucking bastard.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.667
Piece of shit!

00:02:19.584 --> 00:02:21.918
You're worse than a dog!

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.667
You can't even talk
and all you do is eat!

00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:30.999
Didn't I say never go
near the kitchen?

00:02:31.542 --> 00:02:35.918
S-s-sorry...
I-I'm sorry, Father...

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.334
Again with the stuttering!

00:02:39.918 --> 00:02:40.999
You bastard!

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.792
You know what?
You should bark instead.

00:02:45.918 --> 00:02:46.999
I said, bark!

00:02:49.334 --> 00:02:50.999
Not barking?

00:02:54.626 --> 00:02:55.999
Bark!

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:12.167
Fucking bastard.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.542
At least you don't stutter
when you bark.

00:03:19.584 --> 00:03:22.250
Eat this, you bastard!

00:03:43.584 --> 00:03:47.417
The Defects
EP6. My Real Name

00:03:47.751 --> 00:03:50.375
We are live at the crime scene.

00:03:50.751 --> 00:03:56.250
This is the church where it's pastor
and his wife were found brutally murdered.

00:03:56.667 --> 00:04:01.042
Both Mr. Yoon and his wife were stabbed
in the neck and died on site.

00:04:01.083 --> 00:04:03.000
– The police have identified their son...
– Oh, no.

00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:05.626
...as the prime suspect,
who went missing years ago.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.667
Authorities also confirmed that
there were accomplices,

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.999
and are looking into
the possibility of multiple perpetrators.

00:04:15.334 --> 00:04:16.959
Yes, Congressman.

00:04:17.834 --> 00:04:19.667
The bill has passed the plenary session.

00:04:20.918 --> 00:04:22.999
Thank you for your hard work.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.999
Are you satisfied?
Is it all over now?

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:28.250
Over?

00:04:29.125 --> 00:04:31.375
It's only just begun.

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:34.209
The Eye Shopping!

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.959
This just in.

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:39.334
Police have identified the suspect of
the church murder case

00:04:39.375 --> 00:04:42.417
as the son of the victims who died.

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:47.417
They also revealed that they currently
identifying three accomplices.

00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:48.999
We have more news coming in.

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:53.626
Police have identified the key suspects
of the church murder case

00:04:53.667 --> 00:04:57.584
while investigating the area's
security camera footage.

00:04:57.626 --> 00:05:01.542
There are three in total,
including the son of the pastor couple.

00:05:01.584 --> 00:05:04.999
One of them has been revealed to be
the late son of lawmaker Kwon Kang-man,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.292
who took his own life after
a school violence incident.

00:05:10.876 --> 00:05:12.209
Wife

00:05:17.375 --> 00:05:18.542
Hey.

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:20.999
Darling, did you see the news?

00:05:21.334 --> 00:05:23.500
That pastor's son...

00:05:24.417 --> 00:05:26.209
They say there are three accomplices...

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:29.292
Why is Sung-woo among them?

00:05:30.167 --> 00:05:31.999
What are you talking about?

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:35.999
Why are police looking for him?
He should be dead!

00:05:36.584 --> 00:05:37.626
Hold on.

00:05:39.584 --> 00:05:43.125
One of them has been revealed to be
the late son of lawmaker Kwon Kang-man...

00:05:43.167 --> 00:05:45.959
– I'll call you back.
– who took his own life after...

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:47.999
Yes, Congressman.

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:49.542
What the hell is going on?

00:05:49.584 --> 00:05:52.542
Why are police after Sung-woo?
Shouldn't he be dead?

00:05:52.584 --> 00:05:54.375
How can they be chasing
a dead person?

00:05:54.417 --> 00:05:56.918
Are you trying to screw me?

00:05:56.959 --> 00:06:00.999
Congressman,
the police aren't stupid, okay?

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:01.999
What?

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:05.292
Speak, so I can understand!
What's going on?

00:06:06.125 --> 00:06:07.792
Did you just speak down on me?

00:06:07.834 --> 00:06:10.500
What?
Bitch, are you insane?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.999
Who the hell let a bitch
like you loose?

00:06:14.167 --> 00:06:17.125
Hey, I'm the one
who passed the bill.

00:06:17.167 --> 00:06:19.626
How dare you talk to me like that!

00:06:19.667 --> 00:06:22.292
Keep running your mouth
and I'll bring Sung-woo back!

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:23.999
Hey!

00:06:25.709 --> 00:06:27.167
Fucking bitch!

00:06:29.834 --> 00:06:31.918
Sorry for losing my temper, Chief.

00:06:32.375 --> 00:06:35.542
It's fine.
Don't mind me, please...

00:06:37.751 --> 00:06:42.667
Authorities said the security footage
confirmed the church murder case's culprits

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:47.999
are the same ones responsible
for the recent home invasion murder.

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:52.500
It has now become a serial murder case
and switched to an open investigation.

00:06:52.542 --> 00:06:55.209
The suspects' identities
have been partially revealed.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.459
They are said to be in their early 20s...

00:07:01.751 --> 00:07:04.542
They're literally framing it all on us.

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:06.000
Serial murder?

00:07:07.417 --> 00:07:09.667
We should've killed them back then.

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:16.999
Sir, the culprits are terrifying.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.459
Is there even evidence they did this?

00:07:20.792 --> 00:07:24.042
Look. It adds up circumstantially.

00:07:24.667 --> 00:07:26.959
Everyone's after them right now.

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:31.417
If it was revenge,
they would've planning it ahead.

00:07:33.209 --> 00:07:37.042
Don't you think the crime scene
is too messy to be premeditated?

00:07:37.459 --> 00:07:39.626
As if they made it messy on purpose.

00:07:39.999 --> 00:07:42.876
I think the real suspect
is someone else.

00:07:43.999 --> 00:07:45.125
Let's go.

00:07:45.167 --> 00:07:47.167
Isn't that the Metropolitan
Investigation Unit?

00:07:54.542 --> 00:07:56.751
We're taking over the investigation.

00:07:56.792 --> 00:07:59.542
What the hell's going on?
No one told me about this.

00:08:00.918 --> 00:08:02.792
First the home invasion murder,

00:08:02.834 --> 00:08:04.375
and now the church murder.

00:08:04.417 --> 00:08:07.667
Effective immediately,
this is now a serial murder case.

00:08:07.999 --> 00:08:10.918
A serial murder case?
What do you...?

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:13.334
These cases are in our jurisdiction.

00:08:13.999 --> 00:08:17.667
There's been a top-down directive.

00:08:21.709 --> 00:08:23.709
Document for Transfer of Case

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.292
How's your son doing?

00:08:29.918 --> 00:08:31.125
Have you chosen his school yet?

00:08:32.125 --> 00:08:35.334
Yes, he's going to Harvard.

00:08:36.626 --> 00:08:38.500
All thanks to you, Director.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.209
You raised him well.

00:08:41.542 --> 00:08:43.999
I just sold him for a price.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.500
My wife and I are very satisfied.

00:08:46.542 --> 00:08:49.709
My wife and I are very satisfied.

00:08:50.959 --> 00:08:54.999
But I heard there has been
a lot of refunds.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.500
Human greed has no end.

00:08:57.834 --> 00:09:03.167
Still, they raised them
in person since baby.

00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:05.999
Raising them doesn't mean
they become your child.

00:09:06.709 --> 00:09:10.334
They have to deliver.
Like your son, of course.

00:09:13.334 --> 00:09:17.626
By the way, I did as you asked
with the case.

00:09:18.292 --> 00:09:21.500
But don't you think
you're over-doing it?

00:09:21.542 --> 00:09:25.999
There's already a detective
in that district that's been digging things.

00:09:27.918 --> 00:09:30.667
If any trouble comes up,
I'll take care of it quietly.

00:09:30.709 --> 00:09:32.167
You don't need to worry.

00:09:32.209 --> 00:09:35.834
As you know,
an open investigation means

00:09:35.876 --> 00:09:39.792
that the entire process must be
exposed to the media.

00:09:40.167 --> 00:09:42.876
Don't you think
it could get out of hand?

00:09:42.918 --> 00:09:44.918
Especially as it's related to
Congressman Kwon.

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:47.000
The whole country thinks
his son is dead.

00:09:48.792 --> 00:09:50.751
What if they don't get arrested?

00:09:51.209 --> 00:09:52.167
Sorry?

00:09:52.918 --> 00:09:56.083
Just kill them.
Dead people can't be arrested.

00:09:57.959 --> 00:10:00.999
Just catch them
and send them my way.

00:10:01.999 --> 00:10:03.000
Detective

00:10:03.876 --> 00:10:05.959
It's that detective.

00:10:06.626 --> 00:10:08.999
What should we do?
Should we answer?

00:10:08.999 --> 00:10:10.834
No, I don't think we should.

00:10:32.709 --> 00:10:34.000
He sent another text.

00:10:38.167 --> 00:10:40.042
This is Detective Choi Hyung-seok
from Buchon Station.

00:10:40.083 --> 00:10:42.667
I know you're not the perpetrators.

00:10:43.292 --> 00:10:44.334
I want to help you.

00:10:53.999 --> 00:10:55.375
What do we do?

00:10:55.417 --> 00:10:56.834
Ah-hyeon.

00:10:57.876 --> 00:10:58.999
Can we talk for a sec?

00:11:08.876 --> 00:11:10.083
Ah-hyeon.

00:11:10.125 --> 00:11:11.918
If that detective...

00:11:13.542 --> 00:11:15.334
...is really someone we can trust,

00:11:16.918 --> 00:11:18.709
must we really do it ourselves?

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.751
Our revenge.

00:11:21.209 --> 00:11:22.667
What do you mean?

00:11:23.751 --> 00:11:25.292
We're the victims.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.709
If we can prove that,
none of us have to suffer.

00:11:32.667 --> 00:11:36.042
Before I met you and the others,
I'd never been happy.

00:11:37.918 --> 00:11:39.209
Do you know why?

00:11:40.334 --> 00:11:42.876
They treated me worse than a dog.

00:11:57.999 --> 00:11:59.959
This is Detective Choi Hyung-seok.
I know you're not the perpetrators.

00:11:59.999 --> 00:12:00.959
I want to help.

00:12:32.834 --> 00:12:34.000
Have you arrived?

00:13:14.209 --> 00:13:17.959
I, Kwon Kang-man, agree to annul
the adoption of Kwon Sung-woo

00:13:17.999 --> 00:13:20.751
from 18 years ago,
and to discard him.

00:13:21.042 --> 00:13:23.459
The reason is 'defective product'.

00:13:24.083 --> 00:13:26.584
Damn it, this is an annoying procedure.

00:13:38.834 --> 00:13:42.709
If you really want to help us,
do your job as police.

00:14:08.334 --> 00:14:10.459
What the hell is going on?

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.209
Come out!
Who's in charge here?

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:24.999
How long are you going to hide?

00:14:24.999 --> 00:14:27.334
Say or do something!

00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:37.999
Due to personal reasons,
the Director will not be attending.

00:14:37.999 --> 00:14:39.459
We ask for your understanding.

00:14:39.876 --> 00:14:40.999
Unbelievable.

00:14:40.999 --> 00:14:44.751
Over here!
Can I say something?

00:14:44.792 --> 00:14:46.542
Yes, please go ahead.

00:14:46.584 --> 00:14:49.542
You're aware that
the church murder case

00:14:49.584 --> 00:14:53.375
has now become
a serial murder case, right?

00:14:53.417 --> 00:14:55.167
Yes, I'm aware.

00:14:55.751 --> 00:15:00.375
Principal Han Chul-soo of Daehan Elementary
and Pastor Yoon Se-hoon and his wife.

00:15:00.417 --> 00:15:04.999
Rumor has it all three
were clients here.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.709
Are the suspects really defective products
that weren't disposed of properly?

00:15:09.751 --> 00:15:11.083
If that's true,

00:15:11.792 --> 00:15:14.999
doesn't that mean other defects
could be alive as well?

00:15:16.834 --> 00:15:19.999
Hey, say something!

00:15:30.375 --> 00:15:33.709
We've carried out the disposals
with 100% certainty.

00:15:33.999 --> 00:15:38.584
We made sure every defects refunded
by you all were no longer breathing,

00:15:38.626 --> 00:15:40.167
and buried them completely.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.125
There's less than 1% chance

00:15:42.167 --> 00:15:44.999
of a refunded defect to still be alive.

00:15:45.125 --> 00:15:46.999
But what if we can't trust you?

00:15:47.209 --> 00:15:51.999
There's a 1% chance that
our refunds could still be alive!

00:15:51.999 --> 00:15:54.834
What are you going to do then?

00:15:58.459 --> 00:16:00.292
Huh?
Who is that woman?

00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:04.167
Refunded because
of killing it by accident.

00:16:05.999 --> 00:16:08.000
Refunded because it didn't listen.

00:16:09.876 --> 00:16:11.751
Refunded because it didn't grow tall.

00:16:11.792 --> 00:16:13.876
Refunded because
it played too many games.

00:16:14.459 --> 00:16:18.500
You had no problem refunding them
with such pathetic reasons.

00:16:19.626 --> 00:16:22.999
And now a 1% risk
is suddenly terrifying?

00:16:26.292 --> 00:16:27.999
You need to have faith.

00:16:29.751 --> 00:16:35.000
If you've been hiding behind a mask
and left everything to me, then believe.

00:16:35.876 --> 00:16:38.292
Because there's literally
nothing else you can do.

00:16:39.083 --> 00:16:40.999
But if you still don't have faith...

00:16:41.584 --> 00:16:42.999
I'll give you a reason to believe.

00:16:43.918 --> 00:16:45.334
It probably won't happen,

00:16:45.876 --> 00:16:49.209
but if your child were to
reappear right in front of you...

00:16:53.792 --> 00:16:54.959
Ten billion won?

00:16:57.709 --> 00:17:00.417
No, I'll give you a hundred billion each.

00:17:00.459 --> 00:17:01.834
A hundred billion won?

00:17:01.876 --> 00:17:02.999
A hundred billion?

00:17:03.999 --> 00:17:04.999
Will that be good enough?

00:17:11.459 --> 00:17:12.542
Look, he's here!

00:17:12.584 --> 00:17:15.792
– Congressman!
– Congressman!

00:17:15.999 --> 00:17:17.999
Is it true Kwon Sung-woo is still alive?

00:17:19.999 --> 00:17:22.334
- Please say a word!
- Congressman!

00:17:27.751 --> 00:17:30.999
The Buchon serial murder case
has now become a public investigation.

00:17:30.999 --> 00:17:33.417
Kim Se-hee, that crazy bitch...

00:17:34.459 --> 00:17:36.459
You can't go in, sir.
Stop...

00:17:38.959 --> 00:17:39.999
What is it?

00:17:41.417 --> 00:17:44.250
I visited once before.
Remember me?

00:17:45.042 --> 00:17:45.999
Leave us be.

00:17:48.999 --> 00:17:50.125
Have a seat.

00:17:53.999 --> 00:17:55.626
So, what brings you back?

00:18:03.999 --> 00:18:07.584
I, Kwon Kang-man,
agree to annul the adoption

00:18:07.626 --> 00:18:10.417
of Kwon Sung-woo from 18 years ago,
and to discard him.

00:18:10.459 --> 00:18:12.959
The reason is 'defective product'.

00:18:13.459 --> 00:18:15.959
Damn it, this is an annoying procedure.

00:18:22.751 --> 00:18:25.500
It's a scary world.

00:18:27.542 --> 00:18:32.999
They make disturbing fake news
like these using AI.

00:18:33.334 --> 00:18:35.999
So your son is really dead?

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.918
How many times must I repeat?

00:18:38.959 --> 00:18:40.999
Let it go, already!

00:18:41.667 --> 00:18:43.042
Your son is alive.

00:18:51.459 --> 00:18:54.999
If our Sung-woo is really alive,

00:18:55.999 --> 00:18:58.125
bring him to me.

00:18:58.959 --> 00:19:01.334
I want to see him too.

00:19:02.542 --> 00:19:06.042
If he really is alive,

00:19:06.751 --> 00:19:09.999
let me meet him first.
I'm begging you.

00:19:12.834 --> 00:19:14.375
That's all for today.

00:19:23.709 --> 00:19:26.999
What do you think about the police's claim
that Kwon Sung-woo is alive?

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:28.959
Is it true you were
trying to gain sympathy?

00:19:28.999 --> 00:19:31.167
Can you respond to the accusation
that the death was all staged?

00:19:31.209 --> 00:19:35.292
This is your press conference.
Why won't you say anything?

00:19:35.334 --> 00:19:38.167
– Just a word, Congressman!
– Please, Congressman!

00:19:38.209 --> 00:19:39.876
– Please say something!
– Congressman!

00:19:39.918 --> 00:19:41.375
Please!

00:19:52.999 --> 00:19:57.000
Please... that's enough.

00:20:13.542 --> 00:20:16.999
Please stop harassing my son...

00:20:17.792 --> 00:20:21.709
He left because
I was a worthless father...

00:20:22.417 --> 00:20:25.167
Just stop hurting him!

00:20:25.959 --> 00:20:27.999
I beg you.

00:20:27.999 --> 00:20:31.709
You're literally killing our son twice!

00:20:33.918 --> 00:20:36.459
Sung-woo, I'm sorry.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.792
This is all because I'm useless.

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:47.083
My son! I'm sorry!

00:20:51.626 --> 00:20:53.334
If he were alive,

00:20:53.999 --> 00:20:56.000
how wonderful that would be.

00:20:56.959 --> 00:20:59.125
If only he was still alive...

00:20:59.959 --> 00:21:02.584
– Sung-woo!
– Sung-woo!

00:21:04.999 --> 00:21:06.542
Sung-woo...

00:21:14.209 --> 00:21:15.999
I'm so tired...

00:21:17.334 --> 00:21:18.292
What do we do now?

00:21:21.542 --> 00:21:21.999
Kim Se-hee

00:21:21.999 --> 00:21:24.417
This bitch isn't picking up.

00:21:30.999 --> 00:21:34.876
That detective earlier...
He seemed to know something.

00:21:36.459 --> 00:21:37.500
What do we do?

00:21:43.751 --> 00:21:45.167
Shit.

00:21:46.584 --> 00:21:49.709
Let's get rid of everything.
Wipe it all.

00:21:57.959 --> 00:22:01.459
My son! I'm sorry!

00:22:04.999 --> 00:22:07.999
He's not a politician.
He's an actor.

00:22:08.584 --> 00:22:09.959
His acting's gotten better.

00:22:09.999 --> 00:22:11.751
– Jung-hyun.
– Yes?

00:22:11.792 --> 00:22:13.042
Do you have their location?

00:22:13.083 --> 00:22:16.834
The cops pinpointed the area.
We should hear from them today.

00:22:16.876 --> 00:22:18.751
Once they contact us,
pass it on to that guy.

00:22:19.042 --> 00:22:22.042
He wants to find and kill his son.
We should help.

00:22:22.999 --> 00:22:24.999
Now, let's get on with our business.

00:23:44.751 --> 00:23:45.709
Follow me.

00:24:18.834 --> 00:24:19.999
How's Kwon Kang-man?

00:24:19.999 --> 00:24:22.209
He's in touch with
the Joseonjok gangsters.

00:24:25.626 --> 00:24:26.709
Busy, I see.

00:24:27.083 --> 00:24:28.834
I've assigned our guys on him.

00:24:30.417 --> 00:24:32.834
Good. That'll be all.

00:24:46.334 --> 00:24:48.876
Patient Kim Ah-hyeon

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:06.709
Embryo transfer procedure is ready.

00:25:10.542 --> 00:25:11.667
Uncle.

00:25:14.959 --> 00:25:17.000
If I actually do get pregnant...

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.709
What if...

00:25:22.999 --> 00:25:24.417
Just what if...

00:25:26.209 --> 00:25:28.584
If I really do have a baby...

00:25:30.167 --> 00:25:31.250
Then...

00:25:33.209 --> 00:25:35.542
What happens to me after that?

00:25:36.999 --> 00:25:38.209
I should get going.

00:25:38.999 --> 00:25:40.626
Will I be thrown away too?

00:25:46.999 --> 00:25:48.792
Aren't you scared, uncle?

00:25:50.542 --> 00:25:51.834
That Mom might abandon you?

00:26:04.667 --> 00:26:06.834
Aren't you taking me there yourself?

00:26:06.999 --> 00:26:08.250
I've got something to do.

00:26:09.626 --> 00:26:12.500
Okay, bye then.

00:27:33.999 --> 00:27:37.834
If you're looking for someone,
you've come to the right place.

00:27:38.792 --> 00:27:42.000
The kid you asked about,
we're already on it.

00:27:42.584 --> 00:27:47.542
If it were just about finding him,
I wouldn't have come here.

00:27:50.999 --> 00:27:54.876
Okay. What do you want
us to do after we find him?

00:28:07.125 --> 00:28:08.918
Can you kill him for me?

00:28:17.999 --> 00:28:19.083
I'll be right back.

00:28:19.834 --> 00:28:22.125
Yeah, be careful out there.

00:28:23.584 --> 00:28:25.999
Seok-su, you're in charge.

00:28:33.876 --> 00:28:34.876
Let's head inside.

00:28:49.709 --> 00:28:51.000
Location found:
Yeommi-dong industrial complex

00:28:54.042 --> 00:28:57.542
Don't worry.
We already found him.

00:28:58.751 --> 00:29:01.792
A runaway like him only has
so many places to go.

00:29:16.083 --> 00:29:19.500
100 million won for killing him, right?

00:29:21.751 --> 00:29:23.999
Burying him will get you
100 million more.

00:29:24.999 --> 00:29:28.918
No, dismember him or grind him up.

00:29:28.959 --> 00:29:30.999
Make him disappear completely,
and it's 200 million more!

00:29:31.417 --> 00:29:32.999
200 million more?

00:29:33.292 --> 00:29:35.584
Did you hear that?
200 million!

00:30:13.999 --> 00:30:16.626
Shit, who the hell is that?

00:30:22.709 --> 00:30:24.250
You'll help Mom, right?

00:30:26.292 --> 00:30:27.375
You will, right?

00:30:28.334 --> 00:30:29.751
Of course, Mom.

00:30:31.417 --> 00:30:33.999
Good... Thank you.

00:30:50.417 --> 00:30:53.999
I'm Kim Ah-hyeon.
Please help me.

00:31:18.918 --> 00:31:19.876
Should we try calling?

00:31:30.918 --> 00:31:33.542
Researcher Park Sung-geun

00:31:56.834 --> 00:31:57.834
Um...

00:31:59.999 --> 00:32:03.626
Thank you, Ah-hyeon.

00:32:07.042 --> 00:32:09.792
You did the right thing
to contact us.

00:32:14.167 --> 00:32:16.083
I didn't think you'd actually come.

00:32:20.751 --> 00:32:22.334
Aren't you scared?

00:32:23.999 --> 00:32:24.999
Of Mom?

00:32:28.999 --> 00:32:31.667
Yeah, I was scared too... back then.

00:32:33.751 --> 00:32:37.918
But the ones who should be
scared now aren't us. It's them.

00:32:39.999 --> 00:32:42.209
All we have is our lives.

00:32:43.209 --> 00:32:46.999
But that woman has
far more to lose.

00:33:01.542 --> 00:33:03.417
I think they've been exposed.

00:33:03.459 --> 00:33:05.542
Kwon Kang-man is moving
toward Yeommi-dong.

00:33:09.918 --> 00:33:10.999
Hey, are you on your way?

00:33:10.999 --> 00:33:13.542
Seok-su!
Get out of there, now!

00:33:15.918 --> 00:33:16.999
You still haven't reached her?

00:33:21.542 --> 00:33:22.999
Why haven't we started yet?

00:33:22.999 --> 00:33:25.125
Well, Ah-hyeon hasn't arrived yet.

00:33:25.167 --> 00:33:26.834
She's not picking up.

00:33:29.209 --> 00:33:30.751
Ah-hyeon has been kidnapped.

00:33:37.459 --> 00:33:38.999
Madam Lady

00:33:41.459 --> 00:33:42.999
Yes, Kim Se-Hee speaking.

00:33:43.417 --> 00:33:47.000
Sister, today is the blessed day.

00:33:47.999 --> 00:33:51.292
I wish to be there in person.
Would that be okay?

00:33:53.626 --> 00:33:55.999
Thank you for showing support.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.999
It's best to be careful
on the day of the procedure.

00:33:59.542 --> 00:34:02.500
Is Ah-hyeon feeling okay?

00:34:02.542 --> 00:34:06.834
Yes, of course.
Don't worry, thank you.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.209
Kidnapped?

00:34:13.751 --> 00:34:14.918
By who?

00:34:16.209 --> 00:34:17.167
We'll look into it.

00:34:17.999 --> 00:34:20.626
- Are you sure it's kidnapping?
- Excuse me?

00:34:20.999 --> 00:34:22.334
If it's kidnap, bring her in.

00:34:23.792 --> 00:34:24.999
If not, you know what to do.

00:34:25.709 --> 00:34:27.417
Yes, ma'am.

00:34:52.999 --> 00:34:54.999
Kim Ah-hyeon

00:34:54.999 --> 00:34:57.542
- Yes.
- Detective Choi! The kids...

00:34:57.584 --> 00:34:58.999
I'm almost there.

00:35:10.834 --> 00:35:11.959
Detective Choi?

00:35:13.292 --> 00:35:14.500
Detective Choi!

00:35:34.999 --> 00:35:36.000
You two, go down.

00:35:42.999 --> 00:35:44.334
Gosh...

00:35:49.834 --> 00:35:52.999
Joo-an. So-mi.
Watch over Si-woo.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.125
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

00:35:57.292 --> 00:35:58.751
There you are, Sung-woo!

00:35:59.667 --> 00:36:01.459
Your father's looking for you.

00:36:12.417 --> 00:36:13.667
Get him!

00:36:32.334 --> 00:36:33.584
No!

00:36:34.417 --> 00:36:35.542
No!

00:36:35.999 --> 00:36:37.250
Si-woo!

00:36:45.292 --> 00:36:46.834
You son of a bitch!

00:36:56.792 --> 00:36:57.959
Seok-su!

00:36:58.209 --> 00:36:59.459
Seok-su!

00:36:59.999 --> 00:37:00.999
Seok-su!

00:37:07.125 --> 00:37:09.999
The polls conducted by
the Seoul Metropolitan Government

00:37:09.999 --> 00:37:12.375
show Kim Tae-woo of
the People's Reform Party

00:37:12.417 --> 00:37:16.959
to be leading Kwon Kang-man
of the New Future Party by 1%.

00:37:18.334 --> 00:37:23.375
Hey, does it make sense
for me to be losing to that guy?

00:37:23.999 --> 00:37:26.751
What kind of sampling
led to that nonsense?

00:37:26.792 --> 00:37:28.751
Let's connect to the political desk.

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:31.459
In Kwon Kang-man's case,

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:37.125
he played a major role in passing the
so-called School Violence Law revision,

00:37:37.167 --> 00:37:39.834
so expectations were very high.

00:37:39.876 --> 00:37:41.542
But the result turned out unexpectedly.

00:37:42.417 --> 00:37:43.459
What?

00:37:44.459 --> 00:37:45.959
Hey, you bastard.

00:37:46.125 --> 00:37:47.999
What do you mean,
sympathy votes?

00:37:48.999 --> 00:37:51.167
You want me to go begging now?

00:37:55.876 --> 00:37:58.334
Will sympathy votes be enough?

00:37:59.542 --> 00:38:02.417
Losing by just one percent
means you have some popularity,

00:38:02.459 --> 00:38:06.792
but clearly lack cohesion.

00:38:12.999 --> 00:38:15.667
My poor Sung-woo...

00:38:20.292 --> 00:38:23.500
How could he be gone?

00:38:24.792 --> 00:38:26.334
Sung-woo...

00:38:28.999 --> 00:38:31.459
- Sung-woo!
- My baby...

00:38:35.751 --> 00:38:38.459
There you are, Sung-woo.

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:42.959
With all the other defects as well.

00:38:44.999 --> 00:38:46.918
You're still the same, Sung-woo.

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:50.542
Why are you even alive?

00:38:51.292 --> 00:38:54.584
Do you know what I had to do
because of you?

00:38:56.083 --> 00:38:59.876
That woman's got me wrapped
around her fingers now!

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:07.918
How could you disappoint me
from start to end?

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:09.417
Huh?

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.500
Is that why you were born,
worthless bastard?

00:39:16.292 --> 00:39:17.959
Do what you're good at.

00:39:19.999 --> 00:39:20.999
Bark, for me.

00:39:21.999 --> 00:39:23.542
Bark!

00:39:23.834 --> 00:39:24.999
You won't bark?

00:39:27.999 --> 00:39:29.167
Then kill them.

00:39:32.918 --> 00:39:33.959
Seok-su...

00:39:33.999 --> 00:39:34.999
Bro, stop. Don't!

00:39:35.999 --> 00:39:39.876
Stop it!
Stop doing that!

00:39:39.918 --> 00:39:41.542
What are you doing?
Stop!

00:39:52.667 --> 00:39:54.459
Please!

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:57.999
Father, stop! Please!

00:39:58.375 --> 00:40:00.167
I'm begging you.

00:40:00.209 --> 00:40:02.500
You've learned to speak properly?

00:40:03.042 --> 00:40:04.751
I'll die instead.

00:40:05.667 --> 00:40:09.834
If that's what you want,
I'll die for you.

00:40:10.959 --> 00:40:13.626
So please,
just don't hurt the others.

00:40:16.792 --> 00:40:18.459
The kids are leaving today.

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:21.459
It's true. I have their passports
and everything ready.

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:22.999
Please, Father.
I'm begging you.

00:40:22.999 --> 00:40:25.125
Yeah? Really?

00:40:25.999 --> 00:40:27.375
You'll die for me?

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:30.542
I'd very much like that.

00:40:31.042 --> 00:40:32.292
Do it.

00:40:35.125 --> 00:40:38.959
Seok-su, Don't do it!

00:40:38.999 --> 00:40:41.000
- Hey, don't you dare!
- What are you doing?

00:40:41.042 --> 00:40:43.250
Seok-su!

00:40:43.292 --> 00:40:47.999
Don't touch it.
Let go of that. Let it go!

00:40:48.542 --> 00:40:50.999
Put it down, damn it!

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.999
Put it down!
Please, put it down!

00:40:52.999 --> 00:40:54.667
I said put it down!

00:40:56.334 --> 00:40:59.209
Let them go, order them.
Or I'll kill you.

00:40:59.709 --> 00:41:00.792
Let the kids go.

00:41:01.709 --> 00:41:02.834
Let them go now!

00:41:02.876 --> 00:41:04.999
Let them go...

00:41:07.292 --> 00:41:08.667
Run.

00:41:08.999 --> 00:41:10.000
Get out.

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:13.999
Get out of here.

00:41:13.999 --> 00:41:16.250
What are you all doing?
Get out now!

00:41:17.083 --> 00:41:21.125
Ow! Sung-woo...
Please...

00:41:21.167 --> 00:41:24.751
It hurts, okay?
Daddy wants you to stop.

00:41:24.792 --> 00:41:25.876
You...

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.459
You never let me be happy.

00:41:30.999 --> 00:41:33.834
I wanted to choose my happiness
over killing you.

00:41:35.167 --> 00:41:36.999
But you made me do this.

00:41:45.626 --> 00:41:46.999
Seok-su!

00:41:48.083 --> 00:41:49.125
- Bro!
- Seok-su!

00:41:50.167 --> 00:41:51.375
Seok-su...

00:41:51.999 --> 00:41:54.667
- Bro...
- Seok-su...

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:57.999
Hey, it's great to see you!

00:42:03.459 --> 00:42:05.459
- Come on.
- Seok-su...

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.999
What's wrong, bro?
Wake up, please...

00:42:10.417 --> 00:42:14.918
- What do we do...
- Wake up, bro!

00:42:15.876 --> 00:42:16.792
Seok-su!

00:42:16.834 --> 00:42:18.250
Why aren't you saying anything...

00:42:19.417 --> 00:42:20.375
Seok-su...

00:42:20.999 --> 00:42:22.375
Seok-su!

00:42:22.417 --> 00:42:25.125
What happened?
What happened to him?

00:42:25.167 --> 00:42:28.250
Seok-su, look at me.
Look at me, please!

00:42:29.209 --> 00:42:31.542
- Ah-hyeon.
- Seok-su...

00:42:31.918 --> 00:42:33.250
I'm okay.

00:42:33.292 --> 00:42:38.792
Don't talk. Don't talk!
Seok-su, don't talk. You won't die.

00:42:38.834 --> 00:42:42.125
It's okay. I'm good.

00:42:43.918 --> 00:42:45.792
We're all together again.

00:42:47.918 --> 00:42:50.083
Seok-su...

00:42:50.667 --> 00:42:52.209
- I feel good.
- Don't die on us...

00:42:54.292 --> 00:42:55.999
That's my real name.

00:42:55.999 --> 00:42:57.292
Seok-su...

00:42:57.334 --> 00:43:00.417
Fuck you, bastards!

00:43:00.959 --> 00:43:02.167
Seok-su...

00:43:02.209 --> 00:43:03.709
My name's Seok-su.

00:43:07.125 --> 00:43:10.626
Seok-su! Seok-su!

00:43:12.375 --> 00:43:14.876
Wake up!

00:43:15.751 --> 00:43:18.834
Bro... No, bro...

00:43:18.876 --> 00:43:21.751
Bro, please...

00:43:22.042 --> 00:43:24.667
Wake up, please...

00:43:27.125 --> 00:43:28.918
Seok-su...

00:43:30.584 --> 00:43:33.834
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:37.000
Seok-su, I'm sorry...

00:43:43.999 --> 00:43:45.250
Ah-hyeon...

00:43:46.542 --> 00:43:48.500
Ah-hyeon! Ah-hyeon!

00:43:51.751 --> 00:43:53.834
Why are you doing this to us?

00:44:04.584 --> 00:44:06.999
Ah-hyeon... Ah-hyeon!

00:44:45.083 --> 00:44:47.999
Ah-hyeon... Ah-hyeon...

00:44:48.292 --> 00:44:49.834
Seok-su...

00:44:57.999 --> 00:44:59.083
Wake up, bro...

00:45:34.375 --> 00:45:37.334
The Defects

00:45:37.375 --> 00:45:39.999
I promised we'd live
a free and normal life.

00:45:42.042 --> 00:45:43.834
Did you lose them,
or did you let them go?

00:45:43.876 --> 00:45:47.125
Mom's not really our mom.
You should stop too.

00:45:48.334 --> 00:45:52.542
Your husband's DNA
is in my daughter, okay?

00:45:52.584 --> 00:45:55.626
That shows your love for her
is less than 1 billion won.

00:45:55.667 --> 00:45:56.999
Just refund her.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.999
What is this 'D-day'?

00:45:58.999 --> 00:46:00.626
Just one left now?

00:46:00.667 --> 00:46:04.334
Please help Eun-jo
and the other kids to live on.
