=This drama deals with the sensitive topic of euthanasia, which may cause discomfort due to viewers' emotions. Additionally, the characters,
events, locations, and groups depicted have no connection to reality. Child actors and animals were filmed under safe conditions=.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.480
I, Choi Kang Yoon, am
going to end my life now.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.030
This whole process is my choice.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.030
I feel very happy and
content at this moment.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.460
=Dad is VIP=.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.880
If you're not mentally prepared.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.760
It doesn't have to be today.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.760
We can delay.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.830
Or stop altogether -No.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.680
Before the pain returns.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.730
I want to go now.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.180
This is champagne mixed with Pavulon.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.680
It's really simple.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.780
How long does it take?

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.630
Usually...

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.310
It's over in an instant.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.229
He's gone.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.060
Hurry up and leave.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.486
Even though you insisted on
coming, it's really too dangerous here.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.555
Family often visits and there are
many surveillance cameras nearby.

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.456
Choi Kang Yoon said
he felt most at ease here.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.079
It's euthanasia.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.130
You need to feel at peace inside, right?

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.680
Honey, I'm back.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.829
The melon you wanted is out of stock.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.560
I went to a place a bit far away.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.260
Honey, are you sleeping?

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.986
Didn't you say you'd be
gone for more than two hours?

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.329
What's going on? He said
she went to a very far place.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.606
Clean up quickly, don't
leave anything behind.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.136
Okay, hold on.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.910
Where's the money envelope?

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.580
Thank you.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.460
Sorry.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.760
Seems like there's an issue.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.810
- What are you doing?
- Save him!

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.756
It might take some time.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.110
But because of Bafron,
he'll end up dying eventually.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.760
Just proceed directly.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.330
Sorry

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.400
=Death Doctor Mary=

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.906
=Episode 1=.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.410
He came back to life even
though he was about to die.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.005
This is the first time I've
seen something like this.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.606
Could there be a problem with Bafron?

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.260
It's all from the same place.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.386
The issue seems to be not
Bafron, but the previous medication.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.210
You didn't misapply
the basic drugs, did you?

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:31.730
No.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.430
Everything was under control
until he drank Bafron champagne.

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:38.110
His body temperature
dropped enough, no issues there.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.440
We need to check if
there's a problem with Bafron.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.780
There really was no pulse.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.056
This is the pulse.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.586
Even if it's faint, movement
means he's still alive.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.836
Even without my license, I know that much.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.909
There was truly no pulse earlier.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.310
He's an athlete, right?

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.886
Is it because of his large build
that the dosage wasn't enough?

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.336
That's why I said we should use injections.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.206
You know injecting into
a vein is the safest option.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:10.230
No way.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.030
You agreed too.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.356
The final decision should
be made by the patient.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.780
And if injection marks are
left, we could be in danger.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.306
The likelihood of an
autopsy also increases.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.430
It's not

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.206
I know that too.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.810
Next time, the location must be safer.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.186
Even if the client says so, we
can't follow every instruction.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.760
Today was overly dangerous.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.810
It's so cold, feels like I'm catching a cold.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.880
Where are you going?

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.530
Jaeyeon.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.940
If you haven't had dinner
yet, want to eat together?

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.530
Did you go to the seminar with Auntie?

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.330
No, I was just driving her because
I was worried she'd be tired.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:54.960
Even if you're trying so hard,

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.060
Auntie won't suddenly
take an interest in you.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.260
Wow.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.360
Jaeyeon, you're really cruel.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.036
Jaeyeon, in my entire life,

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.560
I've never failed in confessing to a woman.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.210
Do you know the secret?

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.810
I only confess to women
who look like they'd accept.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.436
So don't worry.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.080
Honestly, I just didn't want to
eat alone, that's why I'm here.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.430
What are you doing?

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.430
Hey, Kim Chaeyoon.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.830
We'll eat later, he says he'll cook for you.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.460
It's okay, kids eat dirt
sometimes, it's normal.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.110
I'll remove the needle for you.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.380
But sir,

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.856
you can't just leave when you
start feeling better like last time.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.030
If it won't cure me, I don't
want to spend more money.

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:55.336
Take this off, please.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.987
We still need to check blood
pressure and albumin levels.

00:06:57.011 --> 00:07:02.230
=Albumin Levels [Albumin]: A protein in the blood Low
albumin levels may indicate liver or kidney issues=.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.659
Ignoring it could be very dangerous.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.320
She'll take care of you.
You met her last time, right?

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.336
Well, last time it hurt because of me.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.360
I'll do it.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.286
Doctor Yu, there's a patient
with high fever over there.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.310
Alright.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:15.830
Doctor Yu,

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.530
no matter how busy, you
should still visit a beauty salon.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.660
Okay?

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.480
=Overseas Alternative Investment Seminar=.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:36.960
Hello.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:39.830
Are you looking for me?

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:42.680
Hi -Hi.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.480
You go over there.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.506
That's about enough.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.560
Enough is enough -Exactly.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.756
It's not my health that's the problem,
it's the money. I need to cut back.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.280
If you lack money, leave
your funds with my company.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.836
I'll help you gather some
purchase money with stocks.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.310
My medication costs are too high.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.786
But how is your company's
representative doing?

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:08.906
The stock market hasn't
been doing well lately.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:10.836
I played because I was bored.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.080
I'm not doing it for money.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.286
The problem is those people
who lose money and cry about it.

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:17.710
Those people.

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:22.360
Isn't this what it's for? Just
use this to comfort them.

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:24.710
Like this.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:27.030
Alright.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:33.780
Is there any today?

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:35.060
What?

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.230
Is there any today?

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:39.460
It's like a dog's nose now.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.010
Did you come knowing there'd be goods?

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:02.210
Hello.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:06.636
You've become prettier.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.780
You look even prettier.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:15.380
I need more Bavlon.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.230
Are you in a relationship?

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.530
Didn't you say you've been
taking all the Bavlon yourself lately?

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.810
You don't seem like that
type at all, you look healthy.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.210
That's because you...

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:38.210
Because you watered down the meds, boss.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.630
I trusted you wouldn't
trick me, that's why I traded.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:44.556
You sold me cheap fakes,
and now you're blaming me?

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.760
Yes, I diluted them.

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:48.760
I just wanted to make sure
you weren't reselling the meds.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.480
You're the one using them, right?

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.956
Did you give me those meds
because you were suspicious of me?

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.356
You know I hate this kind of stuff.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.986
I know, all too well.

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.360
But I never intended to
make money selling meds.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.630
I won't infringe on your interests.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.030
Give me the proper medicine.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.530
What's going on again? Oh, seriously.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.580
Seriously.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:23.850
I'll have someone put it in the trunk.

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:25.660
I'll give you the regular medicine.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.180
Won't charge you either.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.080
Do you want to try one dose?

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:30.880
You want to check, don't you?

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:32.930
I trust you.

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.860
Give me the proper medicine.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.810
Just someone performing illegal surgeries.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.080
The head nurse seems to be watching me.

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.880
Could it be someone reported something?

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.910
She monitors everyone.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.906
Reports employees' personal
matters to the higher-ups.

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:37.810
She thinks that's her skill.

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.930
Could the police be
starting an investigation?

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:42.436
Even though everyone is severely ill,

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.986
if they die outside, the
police will be notified first.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:47.580
Even if that's the case,
you don't need to worry.

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.860
If there's an investigation,
it begins with me.

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:51.930
I'll be more careful.

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.080
Who's next?

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:56.160
Thirty years old, Zhao Hyun-woo.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.410
He has a brain tumor
and can't undergo surgery.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:13:59.597
He's had both chemotherapy and
radiotherapy, neither has worked.

00:13:59.621 --> 00:14:02.656
=Chemotherapy [化疗]: Anti-cancer chemical therapy Radiotherapy [放疗]:
radiation therapy=- He can only live for a maximum of four months.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.430
I placed Zhao Hyun-woo's
medical records in your cabinet.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:08.586
You're too young. Have you
discussed it with your family?

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.930
He said he doesn't have a family.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.936
He grew up in an orphanage.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.736
Worked hard to stabilize his life early.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.456
So he doesn't have anyone
he's particularly close to.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.906
It's quite sad, though.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:20.730
But probably no one will
oppose in the meantime.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.480
What's wrong?

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.410
Are you concerned about
the fact he has no family?

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.880
I'm wondering if the lack of
family makes it easier to give up.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.310
Check his medical records.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:41.580
Once you see his pain,
you'll change your mind.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.330
Okay, I'll take a look. Also,

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.830
- This is your share.
- Thanks.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.336
Thanks to you, I can
repay my debts earlier.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.310
Though I still have student loans.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:59.136
By the way, Lee Eun-young contacted me.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.986
Remember she came
for a consultation before?

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:02.972
Eighty years old, renal
failure, wanted to stop dialysis.

00:15:02.996 --> 00:15:06.227
=Renal failure: A condition resulting from diminished
kidney function causing waste build-up in the blood.=

00:15:06.251 --> 00:15:09.571
I remember. She wanted to end her suffering
after her husband died a few years ago.

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:14.330
Two months ago, she was diagnosed with terminal
cancer and was given three months to live.

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:18.460
She says she's completely prepared now.

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:20.680
This is the last plum juice.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.686
I was ill this year and couldn't make any.

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:25.630
Oh, such a precious thing.

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:28.460
Don't feel burdened.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:31.036
I originally made it for guests.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:34.010
I won't be having guests
at my house anymore.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.360
Do you really feel most
comfortable at home?

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.160
As the final place.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.130
My husband's hobby.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.580
Is taking photos of the family.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:10.560
Your family seems to love the beach.

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.990
The photo backgrounds are all at the beach.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.430
All at the same beach.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.020
There's a beach not far from our home.

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:21.826
The kids keep asking to go out and play.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:23.640
But we don't have any money.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:28.200
Whenever that happens, my
husband takes us to that beach.

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:30.580
That beach in the photos.

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:34.970
Holds all of my happy memories.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:38.010
That's why I love the sea.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.730
No, since you love that sea.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.000
Then you should leave from there.

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.160
That said.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:49.940
But there might be people watching.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.270
You don't have to worry about that.

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:57.860
Come on, tell me what you really want.

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.280
What you truly desire, anything is fine.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:07.220
I definitely want to live my
regular life before leaving.

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:10.109
Living as usual.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:11.950
Naturally.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.609
You want it naturally, then.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:15.859
You can do that.

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:20.250
Oh, you swim every morning, right?

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:21.790
You can go for a swim.

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:23.609
And then.

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:27.490
Go leave from there.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.200
I'll take care of the preparations for you.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:42.560
Is it okay?

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:44.610
Of course.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:56.450
Beach.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.000
Very dangerous No, it won't be.

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:02.040
No surveillance at the
beach, only businesses have it.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.900
Should be able to find a blind spot.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.666
Anyway, she went
swimming early, very early.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.370
There'll definitely be nobody around then.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.060
You look great today.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.150
Is your leg feeling better?

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:37.160
Yes, much better.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.440
That's great.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:43.390
My grandson's coming, I'll head off today.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.720
I'm leaving first.

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:46.290
See you next Friday.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.190
Take care.

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:50.320
Take care of yourself.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.240
Got it.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.240
I'm off, bye-bye.

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:03.530
Did you enjoy swimming?

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:08.870
Yeah, I also said my
last goodbyes to friends.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:10.650
I am very happy.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:23.240
I'm a fortunate person.

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:30.190
How many can decide
their life's final moment?

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.690
Thank you for coming.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.400
You're welcome.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.756
Our Dr. Yu is an excellent doctor.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:43.890
But his social skills are lacking.

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:44.860
How should I put it?

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.410
Communication skills.

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:47.800
Lacking awareness.

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.930
So there was a bit of
a mix-up with the venue.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:53.090
Even though it's a bit late,
finding such a perfect place.

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:54.890
I'm happy for you.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.560
Poor social skills, can't you hear?

00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:59.670
You heard that, didn't you?

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.980
Are you mentally prepared?

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:06.770
When you reach my age.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.600
You won't fear death anymore.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.560
Compared to here.

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:15.290
I know more people there.

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:21.300
I think many people I love.

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.740
Make a place a paradise.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.140
She's not breathing.

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.436
It's not because I can't find a pulse.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.120
That I didn't become a licensed doctor.

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:46.180
She might've met her husband by now.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.070
Hurry, get up.

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:49.870
Someone will be here soon.

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:51.396
Don't worry, even if they see.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.660
They'll think it's a sudden
heart attack at the beach...

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.300
Here, over here.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:19.940
Codfish clear soup.

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:21.830
Speaking of codfish clear soup.

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.110
Is it clear soup?

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:30.732
Codfish clear soup is clear soup, right?

00:23:30.756 --> 00:23:32.052
=Diagnosis=.

00:23:32.076 --> 00:23:34.606
But if you call it clear soup, it
doesn't sound appetizing, does it?

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:36.456
Let's go taste it and check the flavor.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.410
Have you checked the
Buflon used for Jiang Run?

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:40.430
Uh, about that...

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.430
It was confirmed, there's
something unusual.

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:46.050
The seal is slightly open.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:47.886
But this won't happen again.

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:48.910
I've taken care of it.

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:52.450
Are you sure?

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:53.540
Who sold it to him?

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:57.550
You don't need to know. Knowing
would just make things more dangerous.

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:01.436
I've dealt with it. It won't happen again.

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:02.796
He won't dare mess around anymore.

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:04.160
No, didn't you just confirm it?

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.020
There's no problem with the medication.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.716
Let's change positions. I'll drive.

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:09.846
I just said...

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:12.490
To be safe, we should eat before leaving.

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:14.990
Only if there's a change in
schedule would that happen.

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:16.160
That's what happens.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.590
Get out quickly, I'm meeting someone.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.720
That's possible.

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:31.420
=Victim, Baek Hyun-seung=.

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:03.670
Captain.

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:06.000
Representative Baek is here.

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:07.846
He said he's here to get an
update on the investigation.

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:10.300
Back when he was a prosecutor,
he was known to be a mad dog.

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:13.330
Now that his son is dead,
he'll definitely be more crazed.

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:26.330
You've arrived.

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:28.700
You have the suspects,
why isn't the case closed?

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.390
We need concrete evidence.

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:54.020
My Hyun-seung...

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:56.630
Could have lived another year.

00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:02.260
We've been looking into
clinical trials and other treatments.

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:04.140
I know you surely can't bear it.

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:07.100
But catching them in
the act is the best way.

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:10.800
My child

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.890
left so suddenly without a word.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:21.430
That's murder.

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:24.310
I promise you

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.470
I will definitely catch the
killer and bring them to justice.

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:38.600
Injecting Pavulon into
patients to help them pass away.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.636
That's psychopathic.

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:42.760
They're maniacs.

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:47.960
Give me more time.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.890
I'll gather solid evidence
from the euthanasia site.

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:55.000
I will... I will definitely catch him.

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:56.990
We'll conclude the
investigation this month.

00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:59.590
Otherwise, don't expect
to continue working.

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:01.890
Do you understand?

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:03.430
Yes.

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:10.740
=Victim: Baek Hyun-sung=.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:24.680
Are you okay?

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:34.886
You mean you ordered takeout

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:37.146
and asked them to deliver it
to this bench we're sitting on?

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:38.816
Yeah, he said he was working

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.800
so I ordered takeout and
asked for delivery here.

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:46.890
What's going on?

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:48.890
He doesn't have family.

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:50.700
No wonder you're so concerned.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.010
After all, without family
it's easier to give up.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:59.796
=Diagnosis Report=

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.930
=Treatment Records=.

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.200
But I feel like he won't give up easily.

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.040
Everything here meets your standards.

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.810
Over three doctors said it's untreatable.

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:14.170
An unbearable state of physical disability.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.490
Pain that can't be
controlled with medication.

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.696
Someone who might be
dying is still delivering food.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:30.720
Seriously.

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:51.960
Are you Mr. Zhao Hyun-woo?

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.160
Yes.

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:54.470
You're Dr. Woo.

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.380
This is what you ordered.

00:28:57.970 --> 00:28:58.970
Thank you.

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.040
I looked at your medical records.

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.060
You must be feeling terrible.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:12.380
How did Ina introduce us to you?

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.970
She said I could seek your advice.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.730
And that you offer different
suggestions from others.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:25.250
Through situations like this, we
understand what patients truly want.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.220
And find ways to help them.

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:31.880
Switzerland can help me,
and I heard you can too.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.940
It's not entirely free; We do charge.

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:40.210
Of course, it's much
cheaper than Switzerland.

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.740
The fee Ina mentioned.

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:44.956
I can afford it.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.960
That's why I'm working so hard.

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:50.230
If it's just for money, you better not work.

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:51.880
I saw your MRI of the brain.

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:54.800
No painkiller will be
effective on you from now on.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.300
Working is very dangerous for you.

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:01.110
I need to pass this interview today.

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.040
You will only help me, right?

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:07.350
I heard you don't help unconditionally.

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:11.270
I still need to review
your medical records.

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:14.816
You don't need to worry
about approved matters.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.797
Looking at your information,

00:30:15.821 --> 00:30:18.380
you already fully meet the conditions…

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.690
We'll carefully review
it and discuss further.

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:27.570
Regardless of the outcome,

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.040
please inform me.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:31.530
I'm used to being rejected.

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:38.810
I'll be leaving then.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.556
I was going to treat you
to what you just ordered.

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:53.980
But you've already paid in advance.

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:55.067
Here's something for you.

00:30:55.091 --> 00:30:56.217
No need, thanks.

00:30:56.241 --> 00:30:57.526
=Thank you for being born=-
It's not something very expensive.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:58.896
This was originally a
delivery I was going to send.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.480
But I rushed and damaged it on the way.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.490
But the taste is definitely unchanged.

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:07.380
Thank you for meeting me today.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.760
Thank you.

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:29.846
A person who wants to die
actually delivered a cake that says.

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:31.556
"Thank you for being born."

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.050
Quite ironic.

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:37.970
=Thank you for being born=.

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:47.086
Did you see the report on the death
of football player Choi Kang-ryeol?

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:48.230
Have you?

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:51.626
You mentioned that among current terminally
ill patients, some die earlier than expected

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:54.216
and sometimes outside the hospital.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.440
Let me report to you promptly.

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.470
As a result, a report about
this player was published

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:07.340

What are you looking for?

What are you doing in our house?

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:16.420
I want to go to school with you.

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.260
I also want to tell you something

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.240
that.

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:27.940
Thank you for saying it's yours.

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:29.880
Ah.

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:33.720
After all, I said I would keep it for you.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.040
But you.

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:40.720
Why did you agree to my request?

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.880
Actually, we're not very
familiar with each other.

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:48.530
What about you?

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.630
Why please give it to me?

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.480
Obviously not very familiar.

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.400
That's because.

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.870
I always feel that you
will agree to my request.

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:03.840
My sixth sense told me.

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:09.250
Come to my house after class.

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:11.910
If you are busy today, tomorrow is fine.

00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:14.550
How about we have a pajama party?

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:15.920
Haven't you played it?

00:34:16.719 --> 00:34:18.516
I invited friends to my
house to play a few times.

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:20.469
It's fun to play with makeup all night.

00:34:21.199 --> 00:34:22.199
How about it.

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:25.350
Why do you want to play with me?

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:32.760
I just think staying up all night
playing with you would be fun.

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:43.260
I'll think about it.

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:46.540
Okay.

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:49.790
But what are you looking for?

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:51.670
I'll help you find it.

00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:54.670
My brother's flippers.
He has a swimming class.

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.480
Why are these pills here?

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:40.840
Does your aunt do drugs?

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.500
No, my aunt doesn't.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:46.727
She's a doctor.

00:35:46.751 --> 00:35:50.280
My mom says even some doctors do drugs.

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:52.390
She has defended such people before.

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:56.180
Because their job often
involves handling medication.

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:01.010
Babylon.

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.460
Put it in and look for the flippers.

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.100
We're going to be late.

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:08.210
Got it, I'll put it in.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.710
But I'm really curious
about what your aunt is like.

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:33.820
Huh?

00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:36.310
Found them.

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:37.830
Your brother's flippers.

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:43.180

=Arts High School
Admission Results Briefing=.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.990
Starting with independent enrollment.

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:04.530
Please bring up the screen.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.630
Student A Internal Review, Level 1, 2.

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.360
Take a photo even if it's not necessary.

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:12.490
Other moms might say you're arrogant
because Taeyeon is a good student.

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:15.640
I'm Eumi's mom.

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.680
We live next door. You didn't know, right?

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.280
Oh, hi. I'm Aunt Caiyan.

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:22.290
It's normal not to know.

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.896
Youmei is majoring in dance,
and Caiyan is in fine arts.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.110
They weren't very close before.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.440
Suddenly, they've become
close these past few days.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:37.660
About 35% is through selective admission...

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:40.740
That father must be
curious about Caiyan's aunt.

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:42.870
Who is she?

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:46.280
Their daughter is Caiyan's competitor.

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:48.856
Caiyan's internal audit is clearly 1.1.

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.360
That father's daughter is 1.3.

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:53.350
So he must be very
curious about Caiyan's aunt.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.596
He's the chairman of the school's
violence prevention committee.

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:58.820
Very dedicated to his child's education.

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:01.306
Heard he's a police officer,
but doesn't seem very busy.

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:02.880
He attends every school event.

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:14.910
The condom came from Caiyan's locker.

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:18.270
This one's mine.

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:19.750
What?

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:22.030
Ah.

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:24.720
Caiyan and I mix our clothes.

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:27.110
Aunt Caiyan.

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:30.540
It fell out of Caiyan's school uniform.

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:36.430
But.

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:39.126
Do they check kids'
personal belongings now too?

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.150
No.

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.001
It was discovered accidentally
during locker replacement.

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:44.780
But.

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:47.320
Now a condom fell from the child's clothes.

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:49.590
Is this really the question
you're curious about?

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:51.930
Just...

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:56.550
If having a boyfriend means
there's a possibility of pregnancy,

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:01.720
I think being prepared ahead
of time is the smarter choice.

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:04.420
Okay.

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:06.810
Even if you're right,

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.521
there's no way the school
could allow such possibilities.

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.716
Not bringing it to school is
the right thing, don't you think?

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:16.610
If Ji-yeon doesn't intend
to do such things at school.

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:21.350
Exactly.

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:26.440
Explain it to her clearly so she
doesn't bring it to school again.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:42.860
=Thank you for your birth=.

00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:48.156
I'm full.

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:49.900
Sa-yun -Did you talk to the teacher?

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:55.820
Yes.

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:57.590
The homeroom teacher showed it to you.

00:39:58.410 --> 00:39:59.410
That one.

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:03.090
It's not mine.

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:05.900
Even if it were yours, it's okay.

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:08.690
I believe it's right to have
it on hand just in case.

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.387
I'm sincere.

00:40:10.411 --> 00:40:11.490
I truly don't

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:17.340
need such things.

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:22.920
Liking someone is not a bad thing.

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:32.260
I'm full.

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:55.640
Wow, this one.

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.720
I wore this during the World Cup. Wow.

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:08.240
=Choi Kang Yoon, may you find peace=.

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:23.620
Um, hello.

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:26.640
We're from the regional investigation
team of Bunseong Police Station.

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:30.030
You're Choi Kang-yoon's wife, right?

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:36.960
Your husband was treated at
Bunseong General Hospital, correct?

00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:40.070
But he ended up living in a
villa after being discharged.

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.080
Did you have any
conflict with the hospital?

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:44.860
No.

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:47.810
We got along well with
everyone at the hospital.

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:52.010
They were very kind, saying they
were his fans, and took great care of him.

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:55.050
He came home because

00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:00.450
after confirming that his condition had
worsened and couldn't be treated further,

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:04.056
he said he wanted to spend
the remaining time with his family.

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:05.066
That's why he came home.

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:06.090
However,

00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:09.766
the hospital believed he could live for at
least another six months, potentially a year.

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:11.840
Isn't his sudden death strange to you?

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:17.730
If you knew how much he suffered,

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:22.840
you wouldn't say such things.

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:26.710
The funeral is today, right?

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:31.040
Delay the transfer to the family tomb.

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:37.946
Your husband made great
efforts regarding euthanasia.

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:41.790
We checked his mailing
records for obtaining drugs.

00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:46.050
Especially with Buflron.

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:49.996
He was determined to find
something for a painless death.

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:51.500
This famous drug.

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:52.700
Are you aware?

00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:56.710
Yes.

00:42:56.770 --> 00:42:59.520
I accidentally found
out by seeing his emails.

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:01.330
He tried.

00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:04.510
But it seems he failed.

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:06.516
If an autopsy is conducted,

00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:09.230
we suspect Buflron's
components could be detected.

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:11.456
Then there will be a formal investigation.

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:12.736
If the major media find out about this,

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:16.750
they might suspect you, thinking
you'll get a huge insurance payout.

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:20.146
Oh, I know.

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:22.170
I know you won't. You
have a clear conscience.

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:24.440
Let's conduct an autopsy.

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:27.380
Before the media starts
spreading such rumors,

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:31.086
we need to verify where your
husband got the Buffron from.

00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:32.360
It sounds like

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:35.486
you're threatening me to do as you say.

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:37.790
Oh, it's not a threat at all.

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:40.781
It's a request for your
cooperation in the investigation.

00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:44.100
You know who it is, right?

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.740
We've agreed to the autopsy.

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:55.040
The hearse just turned around.

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.990
Here.

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:09.760
Your children are with me.

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:11.710
Come over.

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:22.370
Auntie's here. Okay.

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.390
You and Taeyoon should eat first.

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:28.710
Here, what would you like?

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:31.420
For you.

00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:35.056
Thank you for taking care of the kids.

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.280
It's all takeout.

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:39.300
If you haven't eaten,
join us. I ordered a lot.

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:40.670
Ah, okay.

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:50.646
Today Yumi wants to sleep
at my house with Taeyoon.

00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:52.310
You haven't agreed, right?

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:54.700
Ah...

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:58.700
Hello, can we sleep
together at your place today?

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:03.740
I'm counting on you.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:07.440
I'm under a lot of pressure with my
performance preparation at school.

00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:11.380
I want to chat all night with Chae-yeon
about other classmates to relieve stress.

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:21.340
Please take care of my Chae-yeon.

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:22.880
Don't worry.

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:32.090
Did you hear what my mom just said?

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:33.640
Isn't it funny?

00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:37.400
She said it's not dangerous
without adult males.

00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:41.710
She seems to think it's
completely safe with just girls.

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:43.330
Right?

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:47.640
So naive.

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:50.760
Acts like she knows everything.

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:53.100
But actually knows nothing.

00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:54.850
Right?

00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:58.470
Yeah.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.790
Your eyes are really beautiful.

00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:29.030
=Test Result Report
Patient Name Jo Hyun-woo=.

00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:41.960
Whatever the results are, please tell me.

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:44.500
I'm very familiar with rejection.

00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:58.490
=Delivery Guy=.

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:42.786
It's a motorcycle accident patient.

00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:45.220
The injuries aren't very
serious, but he's shouting in pain.

00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:47.336
He keeps insisting on going
home and refuses treatment.

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:48.810
So we couldn't take his vital signs.

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:50.540
Don't move.

00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:55.100
Calm down.

00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:56.570
Jo Hyun-woo.

00:47:58.170 --> 00:47:59.260
Oxygen mask.

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.502
It's terminal brain cancer.

00:48:00.526 --> 00:48:04.090
=Terminal Cancer Brain Tumor=.

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:02.286
Is this a patient you know?

00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:04.790
It's a patient I met at the priest
hospital when volunteering.

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:07.320
There seems to be a mistake
with the anesthetic painkiller.

00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:09.170
I'll handle this here. You all go out.

00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:23.476
The last time the painkiller
was taken was hours ago.

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:24.760
It's useless.

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:26.556
No medication is working.

00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:28.116
Morphine, Tachin, Oxycodone.

00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:29.886
What is it? You need to tell
me the type and time of intake.

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:30.787
Only then can I help you.

00:48:30.811 --> 00:48:32.340
Aren't you aware of my condition?

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.220
I just take them randomly
whenever I think of it.

00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:40.176
To calm him down,
please assist with Ativan.

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:43.200
=Ativan: Sedative=.

00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:41.890
Okay, got it.

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.120
Didn't I tell you not to ride a motorcycle?

00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:55.996
Has the pain become more severe?

00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:58.410
The symptoms seem more frequent lately.

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:00.987
The glioblastoma is progressing rapidly.

00:49:01.011 --> 00:49:06.060
=Glioblastoma: A type of glioma and the most
common and severe tumor originating in the brain=.

00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:04.420
Just a single tumor can become dangerous.

00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:06.860
Just let me go.

00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:09.140
Painkillers are useless anyway.

00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:16.956
You'll end up fainting if this continues.

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:18.620
I'll prescribe you different painkillers.

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:20.546
I don't need painkillers anymore.

00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:22.440
There are plenty of
painkillers at home too.

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:23.880
Speak quickly.

00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:26.290
What medication have you taken?

00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:49.596
Contact the state general hospital.

00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:53.396
Confirm what painkillers were
given to the patient Zhao Xianyu

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:55.196
I think I've been to that hospital before.

00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:56.220
Okay.

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.106
Where did the patient Zhao Xianyu go?

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:15.130
What?

00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:18.470
Nurse Liu, where did the
patient Zhao Xianyu go?

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:20.800
Ah.

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:22.760
Slept after getting a morphine shot.

00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:18.900
Zhao Xianyu.

00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:20.790
Are you okay?

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:22.810
Please help me.

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.040
I don't want to continue anymore.

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:28.300
I don't want to.

00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:51.036
I really don't want to keep working.

00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:52.060
It's too dangerous.

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:57.740
Because of the medical bills.

00:51:58.020 --> 00:51:59.850
Spent all the money saved during this time.

00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:03.370
Because when you're alive, no matter what.

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:04.647
You still need money.

00:52:04.671 --> 00:52:06.060
So don't continue.

00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:10.730
I will seek counseling.

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:14.930
Thank you.

00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:18.970
Friends we've met before will contact you.

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:20.640
You can tell them.

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:23.110
Where you want to be,
how you want to leave.

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:24.440
That's all.

00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:26.710
So before that.

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:30.360
Go do what you truly want to do.

00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:32.620
What you genuinely want

00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:04.430

Please trust in God's mercy.

00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:04.790
Truly confess the sins of the past.

00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:08.660
Because I.

00:56:09.830 --> 00:56:10.966
Through a prolonged period of suffering.

00:56:10.990 --> 00:56:12.860
A patient under treatment has died.

00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:16.970
Due to my guilt.

00:56:19.830 --> 00:56:21.510
I forced the patient to undergo treatment.

00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:24.650
Causing pain to the patient.

00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:27.690
All pain has a reason.

00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:29.750
Only God knows the reason.

00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:34.090
Enduring pain is also mankind's destiny.

00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:38.280
Didn't you try to treat them?

00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:42.890
Only adding to the pain
of untreatable patients.

00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:46.780
Can this be called treatment?

00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:49.540
Who is this pain for?

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:52.860
I'm afraid I can no
longer tell patients now.

00:56:54.090 --> 00:56:56.140
To keep holding on.

00:56:58.090 --> 00:56:59.090
Alright.

00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:02.250
If you believe it's your sin.

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:07.556
But God's forgiveness erases sins.

00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:08.580
Before that, though.

00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:10.250
Self-reflection.

00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:13.470
And the determination
to not sin again is crucial.

00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:16.401
The sacrament of confession
is for making that resolution.

00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:20.970
I'm not here for confession.

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:25.470
Right now.

00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:31.120
I don't want to be someone
who avoids patients' pain.

00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:34.250
What does that mean?

00:57:35.610 --> 00:57:37.640
You don't want to avoid it.

00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:41.810
What choice will you make then?

00:57:46.170 --> 00:57:48.080
I'm leaving this faith now.

00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:51.320
Maria

00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:53.350

=Death Doctor Mary=.

00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:32.177
If you knew your medicine was used.

00:58:32.201 --> 00:58:33.756
In such a dangerous place.

00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:35.246
You definitely wouldn't let it go.

00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:37.186
Who exactly is using it?

00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:38.836
Why do something like this?

00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:42.716
I believe people should have
the right to choose life or death.

00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:45.336
We will let people spend their last
moments where they most want to be.

00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:47.960
Spend their final time.

00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:50.716
But why do you suddenly want
to give up everything so easily?

00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:52.316
Once I wanted to live.

00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:53.340
But not now.

00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.977
It's a car accident patient.

00:58:55.001 --> 00:58:56.276
A motorcycle delivery worker.

00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:58.060
Arrived at the hospital in a state of death.
