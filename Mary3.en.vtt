(This program contains content about euthanasia

(All characters and events are fictional and have

00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:21.883
(3 Months Earlier)

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.066
Please move aside.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.244
What are you doing?

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:36.378
Looks like a major accident.

00:00:36.893 --> 00:00:38.773
Is this the first time
you've seen a car crash?

00:00:42.116 --> 00:00:43.719
Detective Ban Ji-hoon.

00:00:51.118 --> 00:00:52.461
You haven't eaten, right?

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:54.949
One more person is coming. Let's go eat.

00:00:56.804 --> 00:00:58.222
Who's coming, sir?

00:00:58.247 --> 00:01:01.025
It's time for you to get back in the game.

00:01:04.567 --> 00:01:06.275
Have a drink. You're off duty.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.964
Smells good.

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:10.123
Here.

00:01:10.157 --> 00:01:12.531
I already ordered for you.
You can eat tripe soup, right?

00:01:12.556 --> 00:01:14.719
Oh, I can't eat that.

00:01:14.744 --> 00:01:16.484
Then just have the broth.

00:01:17.046 --> 00:01:19.063
Oh, introduce yourselves.

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:23.912
He's a detective.

00:01:26.153 --> 00:01:28.628
Oh, this guy is Jo Hyun-woo.

00:01:28.653 --> 00:01:31.643
He has a brain tumor
and has six months to live.

00:01:31.668 --> 00:01:33.086
I got to know him

00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:35.398
because he's been in and
out of jail since he was a kid.

00:01:35.423 --> 00:01:38.224
He grew up in an orphanage,
all alone, just like you.

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:40.932
Though in a different kind of place.

00:01:41.126 --> 00:01:44.727
His build, weight, and
height are all similar to yours.

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:46.938
So, Ji-hoon...

00:01:47.865 --> 00:01:51.047
from now on, you will become Jo Hyun-woo

00:01:51.281 --> 00:01:53.002
and work with me.

00:01:56.195 --> 00:01:58.930
Why are you eating so fast?

00:02:00.792 --> 00:02:03.109
- Are you okay?
- What now?

00:02:05.504 --> 00:02:07.827
You want me to go
undercover again, don't you?

00:02:08.814 --> 00:02:10.906
I was transferred to the
traffic division because of that.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.175
This time is different.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.219
You know Assemblyman Baek, right?

00:02:14.694 --> 00:02:17.742
The former prosecutor who went
into politics, Assemblyman Baek.

00:02:17.975 --> 00:02:20.758
We have Assemblyman Baek backing us.

00:02:22.015 --> 00:02:23.697
Someone died.

00:02:23.722 --> 00:02:25.266
That guy, Park Kyung-soo...

00:02:27.096 --> 00:02:29.310
Park Kyung-soo really
did something wrong...

00:02:29.335 --> 00:02:32.055
and got caught, didn't he? How
long are you going to blame yourself?

00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:36.811
Ji-hoon, trust me.

00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:38.448
You need to come back
to the crime division.

00:02:38.472 --> 00:02:40.822
How much longer are you
going to be directing traffic?

00:02:40.847 --> 00:02:42.957
Hey, everyone is waiting for you.

00:02:46.845 --> 00:02:48.191
Ji-hoon.

00:02:49.054 --> 00:02:50.371
Hey, Ban Ji-hoon.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.781
Our team will only be
complete when you come back.

00:03:29.624 --> 00:03:32.727
The main suspect, Woo So-jung, is
an emergency medicine physician.

00:03:32.825 --> 00:03:36.750
They euthanize terminally ill
patients, claiming it's a form of help.

00:03:36.775 --> 00:03:38.800
A real psychopath.

00:03:38.825 --> 00:03:40.945
(Suspect: Woo So-jung)
Thinks she's God.

00:03:41.064 --> 00:03:43.430
Go to the emergency room
where Woo So-jung works.

00:03:43.633 --> 00:03:46.242
Tell her you're suffering
and ask her to kill you.

00:03:47.748 --> 00:03:49.781
And do it quickly.

00:03:49.806 --> 00:03:53.000
Because there's a risk of blowing
your cover to her and her associates.

00:03:56.584 --> 00:03:59.594
If you take the narcotic
painkillers, use this antidote.

00:04:14.224 --> 00:04:16.258
Let's get the place ready.

00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:19.626
Find a remote house.

00:04:20.236 --> 00:04:21.657
Don't get soft.

00:04:21.682 --> 00:04:24.243
No matter how nice that
woman seems on the outside,

00:04:24.268 --> 00:04:25.806
she's still a murderer.

00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:27.472
But when she was treating the patient...

00:04:27.497 --> 00:04:29.031
It's okay, it's okay.

00:04:29.663 --> 00:04:32.089
I don't know, sir. She seemed very sincere.

00:04:33.377 --> 00:04:37.480
I know very well how
terrifying these symptoms are.

00:04:39.327 --> 00:04:41.836
But I still want you to live on.

00:04:57.577 --> 00:05:01.023
Oh, where is my dad's bag?

00:05:01.048 --> 00:05:02.568
Oh, here it is.

00:05:02.593 --> 00:05:05.161
How could I just leave it like this?

00:05:19.792 --> 00:05:21.019
I'm sorry.

00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:26.395
I've tried to find another way.

00:05:30.187 --> 00:05:32.401
I don't trust in God.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.728
But right now, the only
thing I can do for you is pray.

00:05:40.609 --> 00:05:41.921
It's okay.

00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:47.242
I will send you...

00:05:50.316 --> 00:05:52.328
to the place you desire.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.479
Mary Kills People

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.123
(Based on the American
series "Mary Kills People")

00:06:13.147 --> 00:06:14.585
Hey, Woo So-jung.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.920
You have to bring her to
the house we've prepared.

00:06:16.945 --> 00:06:17.969
(Episode 3)

00:06:17.993 --> 00:06:20.611
You don't have to feel guilty.

00:06:20.636 --> 00:06:22.133
Think about it carefully.

00:06:22.158 --> 00:06:24.251
You're not entirely lying.

00:06:24.276 --> 00:06:27.094
You're an orphan and you grew up alone.

00:06:27.398 --> 00:06:30.011
Just think of it as your own story.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.750
(October 2024)

00:06:54.132 --> 00:06:55.250
You're here.

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:57.085
Want to take a look?

00:07:07.741 --> 00:07:09.290
Oh, Dad.

00:07:09.453 --> 00:07:11.254
You're here.

00:07:12.384 --> 00:07:15.468
Did Soo-young run off again?

00:07:15.493 --> 00:07:18.202
Please try to persuade Soo-young.

00:07:18.227 --> 00:07:19.717
He's at home right now.

00:07:19.742 --> 00:07:21.155
Oh.

00:07:22.005 --> 00:07:24.393
Then why did you ask to meet me today?

00:07:26.004 --> 00:07:28.796
I heard you were looking
for Soo-young's mother.

00:07:28.821 --> 00:07:32.171
Oh, I was just looking
her up on the internet.

00:07:33.816 --> 00:07:35.554
How did you know?

00:07:35.631 --> 00:07:37.905
Soo-young's mother told me.

00:07:41.991 --> 00:07:43.212
Hello.

00:07:43.237 --> 00:07:46.524
A few days ago, my daughter
was treated in the emergency room.

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:49.055
I need to request the test
results to submit to my insurance.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.763
- What's her name?
- Na Woo-mi, born in 2008.

00:07:56.153 --> 00:07:58.624
There are no test results here.

00:07:58.786 --> 00:08:01.745
She was really examined
and treated at the hospital.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.866
But there are no records at all.

00:08:04.271 --> 00:08:08.327
You might need to inquire with the
emergency room or the treating physician.

00:08:10.013 --> 00:08:11.108
Okay.

00:08:12.577 --> 00:08:16.014
She's remarried now.

00:08:16.352 --> 00:08:18.749
She's a professor in America.

00:08:19.204 --> 00:08:20.647
She has her own classes to teach,

00:08:20.672 --> 00:08:22.882
and children to take care of.

00:08:23.317 --> 00:08:25.436
Although it's a shame,

00:08:25.711 --> 00:08:28.724
she said she probably
can't come to see Soo-young.

00:08:29.779 --> 00:08:32.699
I'm sorry for not telling you sooner.

00:08:33.238 --> 00:08:35.356
You don't need to apologize.

00:08:36.915 --> 00:08:40.186
You want me to keep this
from Soo-young, don't you?

00:08:41.908 --> 00:08:43.107
Yes.

00:08:44.673 --> 00:08:46.455
Even if he doesn't say it,

00:08:46.802 --> 00:08:49.210
he still has warm memories

00:08:49.537 --> 00:08:51.968
of the mother he no longer sees.

00:08:53.387 --> 00:08:56.705
I don't want him to leave this world

00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:00.254
still feeling unloved by his mother.

00:09:02.477 --> 00:09:03.603
Okay.

00:09:09.333 --> 00:09:11.197
Dr. Woo So-jung requested their disposal

00:09:11.222 --> 00:09:13.627
because the documents were
contaminated during treatment.

00:09:20.322 --> 00:09:21.838
Why didn't you pick me up?

00:09:22.573 --> 00:09:24.624
I was busy at the hospital.

00:09:24.649 --> 00:09:26.649
At Jae-yeon's aunt's hospital.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.612
Why were you there?

00:09:31.637 --> 00:09:35.052
Because of the rumor at school that
you took some strange drugs and fainted.

00:09:36.589 --> 00:09:38.473
Who's spreading such nonsense?

00:09:38.498 --> 00:09:41.010
- Was it Jae-yeon?
- If you don't want to talk, don't.

00:09:41.235 --> 00:09:44.163
Because I'll just go ask
Jae-yeon's aunt myself.

00:09:48.903 --> 00:09:50.392
Mom, I was wrong.

00:09:50.417 --> 00:09:52.890
I was so scared, that's why I did it.

00:09:52.921 --> 00:09:55.694
You know I have stage fright.

00:09:56.307 --> 00:09:59.015
I thought it was an
anti-anxiety pill, so I took it.

00:09:59.694 --> 00:10:03.374
So you asked Jae-yeon's
aunt to keep it a secret for you?

00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:05.458
No, that's not it at all.

00:10:05.483 --> 00:10:07.350
I really didn't buy any drugs.

00:10:07.375 --> 00:10:09.546
Then where did you get it?

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:13.983
I secretly took it from the
storage room at Jae-yeon's house.

00:10:14.379 --> 00:10:18.726
I was really shocked too.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.366
I was wrong.

00:10:25.062 --> 00:10:26.749
Mr. Jo Hyun-woo...

00:10:26.921 --> 00:10:29.507
probably won't be able to
participate in the clinical trial.

00:10:29.532 --> 00:10:31.450
If he doesn't want to,
there's nothing we can do.

00:10:31.474 --> 00:10:32.937
Sorry to have troubled you.

00:10:32.962 --> 00:10:34.574
Actually, I already expected it.

00:10:34.689 --> 00:10:38.140
The last time I saw him, he
seemed very discouraged.

00:10:40.092 --> 00:10:41.682
Thanks for your help.

00:10:54.556 --> 00:10:55.900
You're here.

00:10:57.461 --> 00:11:01.054
Yesterday, I went to the hospital
to request Woo-mi's test results.

00:11:02.577 --> 00:11:05.765
You deleted all of Woo-mi's
examination records.

00:11:06.234 --> 00:11:10.127
Was it to cover up the fact that you
were hiding Pentobarbital at home?

00:11:27.768 --> 00:11:29.226
This is it.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.366
We need to have clear evidence.

00:11:32.419 --> 00:11:34.124
So she can't wriggle out of it.

00:11:34.149 --> 00:11:35.243
Yes, sir.

00:11:35.283 --> 00:11:37.038
We've checked and there are no blind spots.

00:11:37.063 --> 00:11:38.954
If we need more, we'll install more.

00:11:38.979 --> 00:11:40.891
If that woman brings the medicine,

00:11:41.324 --> 00:11:44.118
ask about the euthanasia procedure first.

00:11:44.306 --> 00:11:47.030
In case something goes wrong midway,

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:50.199
we'll have a record of
her confession beforehand.

00:11:50.224 --> 00:11:51.639
Don't worry.

00:11:51.664 --> 00:11:55.498
The person in charge of this has
persuaded criminals to confess before.

00:11:56.297 --> 00:11:57.765
But the suspect...

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.077
committed suicide, feeling betrayed.

00:12:02.915 --> 00:12:04.807
What time is that woman coming?

00:12:05.033 --> 00:12:07.640
If you'd like to watch, I
can prepare a seat for you.

00:12:11.901 --> 00:12:13.054
Hey.

00:12:13.989 --> 00:12:16.124
Can't you use your head for a second?

00:12:16.372 --> 00:12:19.749
At that time, you should be
having a meal with your family.

00:12:20.235 --> 00:12:22.639
We're conducting a secret investigation.

00:12:23.016 --> 00:12:25.507
If the chief finds out,

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.976
won't it become a problem later?

00:12:29.913 --> 00:12:31.499
I'm sorry, sir.

00:12:34.085 --> 00:12:36.851
Contact me after it's over.

00:12:38.941 --> 00:12:41.100
Do you think you can catch the culprit?

00:12:41.125 --> 00:12:42.460
Yes, sir.

00:13:01.006 --> 00:13:04.703
The excuse that those drugs are
for euthanizing abandoned animals...

00:13:04.728 --> 00:13:06.702
do you think I'll believe that?

00:13:07.182 --> 00:13:10.108
I know that it's a drug that's
illegal to import into the country.

00:13:13.181 --> 00:13:14.772
So what are you going to do?

00:13:15.475 --> 00:13:18.758
Do you want to file a report to
investigate how I got that drug,

00:13:18.831 --> 00:13:21.662
or how Woo-mi got her hands on it?

00:13:21.687 --> 00:13:22.865
Even if it was unavoidable,

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.896
I'm very angry that you let
my daughter take that drug.

00:13:26.571 --> 00:13:28.460
I can't just let this go.

00:13:29.376 --> 00:13:31.663
I will make you pay for this, I promise.

00:13:32.408 --> 00:13:35.515
Even though Woo-mi
secretly took that drug herself,

00:13:37.003 --> 00:13:39.726
I must apologize for not
storing the drug properly.

00:13:39.867 --> 00:13:42.007
Even though I want to
deal with this right now,

00:13:42.232 --> 00:13:44.445
I'm not stupid enough

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:47.180
to do something that would
get my daughter involved.

00:13:48.308 --> 00:13:50.483
Let's solve this problem another way.

00:13:55.021 --> 00:13:57.045
That's too much.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.880
Soo-young's father already
has his mother's contact number.

00:14:00.313 --> 00:14:02.379
He asked you not to tell Soo-young, right?

00:14:02.404 --> 00:14:04.131
- To say you couldn't find her.
- Yeah.

00:14:04.388 --> 00:14:06.585
I feel so sorry for him.

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.936
So I'm going to give him some special help.

00:14:08.961 --> 00:14:11.383
What are you going to do? Are
you going to persuade his mother?

00:14:11.407 --> 00:14:12.426
No.

00:14:12.983 --> 00:14:16.465
Soo-young hasn't even
confessed his love to that girl yet.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:17.514
So?

00:14:18.495 --> 00:14:19.841
Today,

00:14:20.599 --> 00:14:22.528
I'm going to make his confession a success.

00:14:22.553 --> 00:14:25.052
No, sir. I'd rather just die like this.

00:14:29.467 --> 00:14:30.574
Hey,

00:14:30.939 --> 00:14:32.422
didn't you say the rumor spread

00:14:32.447 --> 00:14:35.073
and that girl already knows about you?

00:14:35.367 --> 00:14:37.344
Then you can just confess your love.

00:14:37.369 --> 00:14:40.080
Even if you fail, there's
nothing to worry about.

00:14:40.105 --> 00:14:42.228
Because death will cover everything up.

00:14:42.678 --> 00:14:44.397
There's one good thing about death.

00:14:44.422 --> 00:14:46.327
It prevents others from
speaking ill of the dead.

00:14:46.351 --> 00:14:48.278
If someone does, they're the bad one.

00:14:48.303 --> 00:14:50.285
Sigh, anyway, I can't.

00:14:50.857 --> 00:14:52.194
It would be a very regrettable memory.

00:14:52.218 --> 00:14:53.505
What are you afraid of?

00:14:53.949 --> 00:14:56.076
I'll take care of it for you.

00:14:58.185 --> 00:14:59.967
I even bought a men's cushion foundation.

00:14:59.992 --> 00:15:02.380
I'll turn you into an idol.

00:15:02.405 --> 00:15:04.165
That's not the problem.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:06.190
Then what is the problem?

00:15:08.479 --> 00:15:10.984
Right now, my body has a smell.

00:15:12.828 --> 00:15:15.384
- Huh?
- I heard it from my grandmother.

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:17.783
That people who are
about to die have this smell.

00:15:18.539 --> 00:15:20.689
My body smells terrible.

00:15:21.716 --> 00:15:24.072
I probably can't go see Hye-jeong.

00:15:25.911 --> 00:15:30.275
Do people really get a smell
like this when they're about to die?

00:15:45.294 --> 00:15:46.845
Like this.

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:48.705
It will help the smell go away.

00:16:30.412 --> 00:16:31.619
Hey, Hye-jeong.

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:36.443
Oh, isn't that Hye-jeong? How are you?

00:16:36.468 --> 00:16:38.130
I'm Jo Soo-young, do you remember?

00:16:38.155 --> 00:16:40.259
I'm glad to see you.

00:16:40.473 --> 00:16:43.173
The more you do it, the weirder it looks.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:46.330
Hey, hey, first, let's spray some perfume.

00:16:47.733 --> 00:16:50.283
You don't have a late
class tonight, do you?

00:16:54.247 --> 00:16:55.656
Oh, Dr. Woo.

00:16:57.232 --> 00:16:58.896
After the funeral,

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.029
she came to see the doctor
who took care of Mr. Choi

00:17:01.054 --> 00:17:03.505
to express her gratitude.

00:17:06.861 --> 00:17:08.181
Thank you.

00:17:08.797 --> 00:17:12.520
I've already given gifts
to the other doctors.

00:17:12.895 --> 00:17:16.189
But I thought you were off,
Dr. Woo, so I left the gift in my car.

00:17:16.214 --> 00:17:17.644
Although it's nothing special,

00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:21.640
could you please accept it as a token of
my gratitude for taking care of my husband?

00:17:25.208 --> 00:17:27.880
I feel bad coming empty-handed.

00:17:28.165 --> 00:17:30.680
I'll go buy a gift. Give me 20,000 won.

00:17:31.003 --> 00:17:33.440
- It's okay.
- Hello.

00:17:34.779 --> 00:17:37.960
I've already bought all the necessities.

00:17:39.706 --> 00:17:41.400
Hello.

00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:44.240
(Jo Hyun-woo)

00:17:48.467 --> 00:17:49.892
Nurse, nurse.

00:17:49.917 --> 00:17:51.181
Yes.

00:17:54.353 --> 00:17:56.472
(Detective Boo)

00:18:00.511 --> 00:18:03.337
I told you to contact me after
you were done. Is there a problem?

00:18:03.362 --> 00:18:06.360
Jo Hyun-woo has
disappeared from the hospital.

00:18:24.031 --> 00:18:25.885
Did he pass away peacefully?

00:18:34.125 --> 00:18:37.323
I had no idea this is what he wanted.

00:18:38.917 --> 00:18:41.456
I feel guilty for not listening to him.

00:18:50.145 --> 00:18:51.873
I was scared.

00:18:52.295 --> 00:18:55.865
I was scared I would feel guilty later.

00:18:58.024 --> 00:18:59.937
Even though I said I loved him,

00:19:01.815 --> 00:19:05.253
I didn't want to admit that
the only thing I could do for him

00:19:05.278 --> 00:19:07.042
was to let him go.

00:19:09.753 --> 00:19:11.549
I regret it so much.

00:19:12.439 --> 00:19:15.659
If I had listened to his request back then,

00:19:17.594 --> 00:19:19.305
when he fell asleep,

00:19:20.574 --> 00:19:23.565
I could have been there holding his hand.

00:19:35.078 --> 00:19:38.399
It's an air freshener. I gave the
same one to the other doctors.

00:19:41.182 --> 00:19:42.424
Inside this,

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:45.167
is a Serenity Foundation pamphlet,

00:19:45.933 --> 00:19:48.698
euthanasia documents,
and your business card,

00:19:49.218 --> 00:19:51.653
along with a phone I've never seen before.

00:19:52.605 --> 00:19:55.471
I happened to find it while going
through my husband's things.

00:19:55.934 --> 00:19:58.450
But I don't know how to get rid of it.

00:20:06.252 --> 00:20:08.011
Don't worry.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:10.807
Today...

00:20:11.392 --> 00:20:14.260
I will pretend that I've
never met you, Woo So-jung.

00:20:19.774 --> 00:20:21.838
Thank you for...

00:20:23.793 --> 00:20:25.682
helping my husband.

00:20:32.163 --> 00:20:33.575
Thank you.

00:21:10.237 --> 00:21:12.963
Why come here if you're about to
die? You should be out having fun.

00:21:12.988 --> 00:21:14.822
You've never come here before.

00:21:15.549 --> 00:21:17.073
Oh, uh...

00:21:17.323 --> 00:21:18.936
I felt a little regretful.

00:21:19.364 --> 00:21:23.286
Suddenly, I wanted to come
and learn something before I go.

00:21:23.311 --> 00:21:25.298
Do you really feel that way before you die?

00:21:25.323 --> 00:21:27.414
- Oh, hmm.
- Hello.

00:21:27.439 --> 00:21:29.591
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:21:29.616 --> 00:21:32.594
- Why isn't Hye-jeong here?
- Her class times overlap with another subject.

00:21:32.695 --> 00:21:34.378
Study hard so you don't regret it later.

00:21:34.403 --> 00:21:37.213
- Hey, where are you going?
- Hey.

00:21:57.558 --> 00:21:58.876
Welcome.

00:21:58.901 --> 00:22:00.518
Hello.

00:22:05.675 --> 00:22:07.651
What should I eat?

00:22:07.676 --> 00:22:09.176
I think I'll have this.

00:22:17.494 --> 00:22:18.694
Soo-young?

00:22:19.572 --> 00:22:20.779
Hye-jeong.

00:22:24.861 --> 00:22:26.882
You go up first.

00:22:29.605 --> 00:22:30.995
How did you get here?

00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:33.573
I have a math tutoring session here.

00:22:33.598 --> 00:22:36.053
Oh, I see.

00:22:36.514 --> 00:22:38.185
So that's how it is.

00:22:38.258 --> 00:22:39.990
I've already heard.

00:22:41.639 --> 00:22:43.092
Are you okay?

00:22:45.296 --> 00:22:46.631
I don't know.

00:22:47.334 --> 00:22:48.779
It hurts sometimes.

00:22:49.137 --> 00:22:51.342
And I wonder if I'm
really going to die like this.

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.279
It doesn't feel real.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.826
Are you really going to die?

00:23:00.485 --> 00:23:02.701
The doctor said I have two weeks left.

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:24.634
Hye-jeong.

00:23:29.548 --> 00:23:30.965
I...

00:23:32.611 --> 00:23:34.201
I miss you.

00:23:35.048 --> 00:23:37.050
- Huh?
- So...

00:23:37.075 --> 00:23:39.184
if you have some time,

00:23:39.824 --> 00:23:41.750
no, I don't have time now.

00:23:42.404 --> 00:23:43.716
Want to meet up later?

00:23:45.609 --> 00:23:48.637
My mom is picking me
up right after class today.

00:23:49.534 --> 00:23:50.802
Oh.

00:23:53.069 --> 00:23:54.842
Oh, that's right.

00:23:54.867 --> 00:23:56.802
Yeah, yeah, you have to go back.

00:23:57.106 --> 00:23:58.576
Want to meet tomorrow?

00:23:58.601 --> 00:24:00.810
I can reschedule my class tomorrow.

00:24:01.158 --> 00:24:03.256
You can wait until tomorrow, right?

00:24:05.858 --> 00:24:06.938
Yeah.

00:24:07.214 --> 00:24:09.584
Okay, see you tomorrow.

00:24:09.609 --> 00:24:11.029
Yeah.

00:24:12.676 --> 00:24:14.687
Choi Kang-yoon's wife came to see me.

00:24:14.712 --> 00:24:17.115
What? Did she report it?

00:24:17.507 --> 00:24:19.192
No, I don't think so.

00:24:19.417 --> 00:24:22.217
I don't know why, but it seems
she's helping to cover it up.

00:24:22.733 --> 00:24:25.965
We need to be careful for a while.
We only have one bottle of the drug left.

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.947
Why? Isn't there another box?

00:24:34.212 --> 00:24:37.638
There was a fight at the hospital,
and the cabinet fell and broke.

00:24:43.004 --> 00:24:45.213
I'm going to Mr. Hyun-woo's house alone.

00:24:45.974 --> 00:24:47.928
Can you handle it by yourself?

00:24:48.678 --> 00:24:50.787
It might be overwhelming
to go alone, it's true.

00:24:52.123 --> 00:24:54.649
But I want to send
Mr. Hyun-woo off by myself.

00:24:57.703 --> 00:25:00.928
You two probably want to say your goodbyes.

00:25:01.381 --> 00:25:02.819
Be careful on your way.

00:25:06.248 --> 00:25:07.833
Oh, oh, anyway,

00:25:07.858 --> 00:25:10.364
I have to go with
Soo-young to see his friend.

00:25:10.389 --> 00:25:11.673
Tomorrow is an important day.

00:25:11.705 --> 00:25:14.288
There's no time. Just give up.

00:25:14.313 --> 00:25:16.139
Don't stop me.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.397
I have my professional pride, you know.

00:25:29.003 --> 00:25:30.850
What's this now?

00:25:43.024 --> 00:25:45.210
Oh, Hye-jeong.

00:25:49.115 --> 00:25:50.640
Let's go that way.

00:25:50.925 --> 00:25:52.400
Let's go that way.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.706
(November 2024)

00:28:15.264 --> 00:28:17.276
How could I not know?

00:28:18.084 --> 00:28:20.022
Did you know I liked you?

00:28:20.244 --> 00:28:21.994
Back in elementary school,

00:28:22.019 --> 00:28:25.014
you always ate the broccoli
and bell peppers for me.

00:28:25.039 --> 00:28:27.048
And you gave me your shoes to wear,

00:28:27.217 --> 00:28:29.103
while you walked barefoot.

00:28:30.598 --> 00:28:32.600
How could I not know?

00:28:33.661 --> 00:28:35.472
That was when we were kids.

00:28:38.444 --> 00:28:40.585
Oh, dear.

00:28:42.307 --> 00:28:44.303
If we still had time...

00:28:44.459 --> 00:28:46.459
would you like me?

00:28:47.598 --> 00:28:49.103
Not like right now.

00:28:49.771 --> 00:28:50.921
That...

00:28:51.757 --> 00:28:54.491
I don't know, because we've never dated.

00:28:56.317 --> 00:28:57.639
That's true.

00:28:58.453 --> 00:28:59.960
There's no time left.

00:29:14.241 --> 00:29:16.046
When I heard about you,

00:29:16.185 --> 00:29:17.710
I cried a lot.

00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:24.297
We've held hands now.

00:29:28.473 --> 00:29:30.116
Are you being this nice to me

00:29:30.811 --> 00:29:32.303
because I'm about to die?

00:29:32.348 --> 00:29:34.319
That might be part of it.

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.645
But,

00:29:40.223 --> 00:29:42.741
if the person who was
going to die wasn't you,

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.999
I wouldn't be this sad.

00:30:20.372 --> 00:30:21.796
Are you okay?

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:28.796
Are you okay? What should I do?

00:30:28.821 --> 00:30:30.061
Soo-young.

00:30:31.267 --> 00:30:33.358
What should I do?

00:30:33.558 --> 00:30:35.257
- Soo-young!
- Who are you?

00:30:35.282 --> 00:30:37.608
I'm the doctor in charge of Soo-young.

00:30:37.633 --> 00:30:39.993
I was worried about him, so I
was watching from a distance.

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:43.671
I'm sorry.

00:30:43.868 --> 00:30:45.116
I'm sorry.

00:30:45.495 --> 00:30:47.311
I had a lot of fun today.

00:30:47.804 --> 00:30:49.241
I'm going now.

00:31:00.042 --> 00:31:01.915
This won't do.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.353
I'll carry you.

00:31:03.648 --> 00:31:05.070
Wait, sir.

00:31:06.341 --> 00:31:08.024
Hye-jeong is watching.

00:31:09.253 --> 00:31:11.056
I want her to remember me well.

00:31:14.983 --> 00:31:17.749
Okay, okay. Hold on to me.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:24.952
So cool.

00:31:29.262 --> 00:31:30.590
Soo-young.

00:31:32.614 --> 00:31:35.007
Let's meet here again tomorrow.

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:36.798
You'll come, right?

00:31:47.121 --> 00:31:48.463
Let's go.

00:31:49.439 --> 00:31:50.694
Let's go.

00:32:07.317 --> 00:32:09.005
Wow, Soo-young.

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:11.717
I'm so jealous of your life.

00:32:11.742 --> 00:32:13.498
So much better than mine.

00:32:13.523 --> 00:32:16.663
You confessed your love. You did great.

00:32:18.426 --> 00:32:19.811
I know, right?

00:32:19.952 --> 00:32:23.358
I was pretty cool today.

00:32:23.761 --> 00:32:26.790
When we get home, I'll
give you a painkiller shot.

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:29.920
Go on a date with Hye-jeong tomorrow.

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:37.605
- Sir.
- Hmm?

00:32:43.031 --> 00:32:44.655
I...

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.123
want to go today.

00:32:52.436 --> 00:32:53.572
Why?

00:32:56.224 --> 00:32:57.939
I've done...

00:33:00.151 --> 00:33:01.666
everything I wanted to do.

00:33:04.237 --> 00:33:06.056
Please let me go today.

00:33:19.099 --> 00:33:21.717
Ji-hoon, this medicine
is just a precaution.

00:33:21.742 --> 00:33:24.709
If something goes
wrong, take this medicine.

00:33:28.476 --> 00:33:29.994
These symptoms...

00:33:30.018 --> 00:33:32.444
it's true they indicate that you're dying.

00:33:32.953 --> 00:33:35.381
But I want you to continue living.

00:33:45.483 --> 00:33:47.538
Oh, that was a beautiful shot.

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.858
Dr. Woo.

00:34:10.217 --> 00:34:13.530
Another priest was
contacted by the hospital.

00:34:14.152 --> 00:34:15.717
What is it?

00:34:16.271 --> 00:34:18.660
He said Hyun-woo is at the hospital.

00:34:22.127 --> 00:34:26.014
A body covered with a newspaper
was found at the subway station.

00:34:26.536 --> 00:34:27.657
And that...

00:34:27.965 --> 00:34:30.070
I was hoping he was okay.

00:34:32.237 --> 00:34:34.048
But Hyun-woo has passed away.

00:34:48.227 --> 00:34:49.446
Are you sure?

00:34:49.821 --> 00:34:52.016
Yes, the hospital has confirmed it.

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:56.734
Who is she talking to on the phone?

00:34:58.171 --> 00:34:59.850
I can't go there right now.

00:34:59.875 --> 00:35:02.006
Dr. Woo, could you go instead?

00:35:03.367 --> 00:35:04.682
I'm sorry.

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:08.014
I'm busy at the moment...

00:35:09.584 --> 00:35:11.514
I'll call you back.

00:35:17.798 --> 00:35:19.498
Is something wrong?

00:35:26.156 --> 00:35:28.264
A patient I was very worried about

00:35:28.711 --> 00:35:30.100
has passed away.

00:35:42.009 --> 00:35:43.936
I must have been very nervous.

00:35:45.978 --> 00:35:47.897
I need a drink of water.

00:36:04.144 --> 00:36:06.670
What? Is this the only angle here?

00:36:06.835 --> 00:36:10.045
That place seemed safe,
so we didn't install a camera.

00:36:30.455 --> 00:36:33.463
(Naproxen)

00:36:35.817 --> 00:36:37.626
Oh, I remember him.

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:39.572
He said he was allergic to medicine.

00:36:39.597 --> 00:36:42.123
He can't take fever reducers
that contain acetaminophen,

00:36:42.148 --> 00:36:44.616
so he asked for ibuprofen instead.

00:37:41.497 --> 00:37:43.000
Mr. Hyun-woo, you should drink too.

00:37:45.634 --> 00:37:47.156
I'll do it when I feel more at ease.

00:37:54.083 --> 00:37:55.881
- Did she put something in it?
- What did she put in?

00:37:55.905 --> 00:37:58.219
I don't know, because we can't see.

00:38:13.985 --> 00:38:15.702
What should we do now?

00:38:20.886 --> 00:38:23.952
Wait a moment. I forgot
something in the car.

00:38:31.789 --> 00:38:33.311
She's out.

00:39:45.558 --> 00:39:47.382
Damn it, the plan is blown.

00:40:14.762 --> 00:40:16.032
Is everything okay?

00:40:16.057 --> 00:40:18.188
Why did you turn off your phone?

00:40:19.048 --> 00:40:20.157
Right now...

00:40:20.964 --> 00:40:22.892
it seems we have to send Soo-young off.

00:40:22.917 --> 00:40:24.390
Bring the medicine here.

00:40:24.878 --> 00:40:27.554
I'm sorry, I don't have any medicine left.

00:40:28.011 --> 00:40:29.209
Jo Hyun-woo...

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:32.835
That man is a police officer.

00:40:33.443 --> 00:40:34.553
What?

00:40:35.279 --> 00:40:36.584
Are you okay?

00:40:36.793 --> 00:40:38.083
I'm fine.

00:40:40.667 --> 00:40:42.168
So what should we do?

00:40:42.193 --> 00:40:46.437
I need to go get the medicine,
but Soo-young is alone right now.

00:40:46.462 --> 00:40:48.062
His father is on his way.

00:40:49.905 --> 00:40:51.734
Does Soo-young want to do it right away?

00:40:51.759 --> 00:40:52.899
Yeah.

00:40:52.959 --> 00:40:56.367
His condition is severe. If we make
a mistake, he could go into shock.

00:40:56.392 --> 00:40:57.882
We can't delay any longer.

00:41:03.259 --> 00:41:04.840
Then you take care of Soo-young.

00:41:04.865 --> 00:41:06.651
Send me the details. I'll
go get the medicine myself.

00:41:06.675 --> 00:41:09.589
But I haven't been able to contact
the drug dealer for a few days.

00:41:09.614 --> 00:41:12.378
What about someone else? Is there
anyone who might have the drug?

00:41:12.403 --> 00:41:14.726
Chairman Goo might have some.

00:41:15.138 --> 00:41:17.546
No, it's dangerous for you to go alone.

00:41:17.983 --> 00:41:19.780
I've told you before.

00:41:19.805 --> 00:41:21.605
If there's any danger,
I'll handle it myself.

00:41:23.132 --> 00:41:24.274
No, you can't.

00:41:24.299 --> 00:41:27.918
You can't handle drug dealers.

00:41:27.943 --> 00:41:29.389
I'm a doctor.

00:41:29.492 --> 00:41:31.177
Didn't you say Soo-young is in trouble?

00:41:31.202 --> 00:41:33.723
There's no time. Tell
me where I need to go.

00:42:16.447 --> 00:42:17.976
Did you forget something again...

00:42:25.906 --> 00:42:28.109
The number you have
dialed cannot be reached...

00:42:50.462 --> 00:42:52.312
Are you a friend of Dr. Choi?

00:42:53.607 --> 00:42:55.611
He just bought a box not long ago.

00:42:55.636 --> 00:42:57.421
Did he use it all up already?

00:42:58.516 --> 00:42:59.999
It's an emergency.

00:43:00.375 --> 00:43:01.985
I'll pay whatever you ask.

00:43:03.215 --> 00:43:05.220
You'd have to pay anyway.

00:43:09.743 --> 00:43:14.249
Do you know how serious a
crime you're committing right now?

00:43:14.927 --> 00:43:16.440
If you're going to buy drugs,

00:43:16.465 --> 00:43:18.124
you should do it quietly, but...

00:43:18.149 --> 00:43:19.993
you just barge in here

00:43:20.018 --> 00:43:23.520
and ask for drugs so casually?

00:43:23.707 --> 00:43:27.795
One mistake and you could
rot in jail, and yet you do this?

00:43:30.188 --> 00:43:31.601
I'm sorry.

00:43:31.968 --> 00:43:34.265
Absolutely nothing will leak.

00:43:34.764 --> 00:43:37.074
Because if anything gets
out, we'll be in trouble too.

00:43:45.034 --> 00:43:46.656
I will...

00:43:47.015 --> 00:43:48.515
give you everything you want.

00:43:48.741 --> 00:43:50.226
But right now,

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.828
I need Pentobarbital.

00:43:54.405 --> 00:43:56.507
I can't reach her. I'm going crazy.

00:43:56.541 --> 00:43:58.538
- Are you okay?
- I got the medicine.

00:43:58.792 --> 00:44:00.882
Let's talk later. Is Soo-young okay?

00:44:47.244 --> 00:44:48.734
Are you ready?

00:44:53.078 --> 00:44:54.328
Yes.

00:44:59.368 --> 00:45:01.421
Could you help him?

00:45:42.841 --> 00:45:44.150
I'm sorry.

00:45:45.517 --> 00:45:47.325
Dad tried.

00:45:48.011 --> 00:45:50.515
But in the end, I couldn't find Mom.

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:52.911
I'm sorry.

00:45:53.594 --> 00:45:55.351
Mom must hate me

00:45:55.606 --> 00:45:58.046
so much that she went into hiding.

00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:02.481
I see.

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:05.585
Dad.

00:46:06.904 --> 00:46:08.936
I have a favor to ask.

00:46:10.276 --> 00:46:13.171
Of course, you can tell me anything.

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:17.984
You remember Hye-jeong, right?

00:46:18.791 --> 00:46:20.749
My friend since kindergarten.

00:46:22.229 --> 00:46:25.744
She'll probably be waiting
for me at the park tomorrow.

00:46:27.188 --> 00:46:28.790
Please go and tell her for me.

00:46:29.483 --> 00:46:31.054
Don't startle her.

00:46:38.244 --> 00:46:39.353
Soo-young.

00:46:41.493 --> 00:46:43.891
Are you really not going to see her?

00:46:44.458 --> 00:46:48.339
If you take the medicine, you
should be able to last until tomorrow.

00:46:49.151 --> 00:46:51.011
If I go see her tomorrow,

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:53.925
Hye-jeong will definitely
fall in love with me.

00:46:54.906 --> 00:46:56.972
That would be too pitiful for her.

00:46:59.444 --> 00:47:00.701
That's true.

00:47:00.726 --> 00:47:03.996
Hye-jeong would definitely
fall in love with you.

00:47:06.636 --> 00:47:08.559
Dad, please talk to her for me.

00:47:08.762 --> 00:47:10.113
I will.

00:47:10.441 --> 00:47:11.894
I'll talk to her.

00:47:13.861 --> 00:47:15.082
Soo-young.

00:47:18.117 --> 00:47:19.618
I'm sorry.

00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:24.839
For not being able to
give you a healthy body.

00:47:33.826 --> 00:47:35.352
It couldn't be helped.

00:47:37.579 --> 00:47:40.878
You take care of your health too, Dad.

00:47:44.902 --> 00:47:46.433
Dad...

00:47:46.782 --> 00:47:49.449
loves you very much.

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.886
Scolding you every day,

00:47:53.871 --> 00:47:55.347
always getting angry.

00:47:58.352 --> 00:47:59.894
Because Dad...

00:48:02.913 --> 00:48:06.454
thought doing that would be better for you.

00:48:07.555 --> 00:48:09.749
I'm truly sorry

00:48:10.882 --> 00:48:12.616
for making you feel bad.

00:48:15.449 --> 00:48:16.851
Really?

00:48:16.883 --> 00:48:18.273
Yeah.

00:48:20.252 --> 00:48:24.413
I thought you were ashamed
to have a son like me.

00:48:27.025 --> 00:48:29.163
I'm very grateful to you.

00:48:30.048 --> 00:48:31.733
You...

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.999
were a good grandson to your grandma,

00:48:35.377 --> 00:48:37.491
and always a good son to me.

00:48:38.742 --> 00:48:40.538
Even without a mother,

00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:42.741
you never complained.

00:48:42.904 --> 00:48:45.923
I know you've had to endure a lot.

00:48:47.719 --> 00:48:49.390
Thank you.

00:49:03.388 --> 00:49:04.793
Soo-young.

00:49:06.986 --> 00:49:08.577
Son...

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:10.827
Stay with Dad for just one more day.

00:49:15.124 --> 00:49:16.639
Dad.

00:49:17.467 --> 00:49:18.952
Dad.

00:49:26.106 --> 00:49:27.640
Dad.

00:49:29.083 --> 00:49:30.191
Hmm?

00:49:33.338 --> 00:49:34.827
I'm sorry.

00:49:41.852 --> 00:49:43.150
I don't want to live anymore.

00:49:45.137 --> 00:49:47.105
Since my diagnosis,

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.363
I've never...

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:51.801
felt as good as I do today.

00:49:54.614 --> 00:49:56.590
I want to leave today.

00:50:21.942 --> 00:50:23.457
Well...

00:50:23.687 --> 00:50:25.715
I'd like to change...

00:50:26.771 --> 00:50:28.543
to the cup...

00:50:29.575 --> 00:50:32.598
that I got from the amusement
park when I was a kid.

00:50:34.628 --> 00:50:36.637
The cup with the family picture.

00:50:37.398 --> 00:50:39.355
I want to drink from that cup.

00:51:52.701 --> 00:51:54.178
Soo-young.

00:51:54.781 --> 00:51:56.365
Don't be afraid.

00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:59.112
Dad is here.

00:52:00.522 --> 00:52:02.037
It's okay.

00:52:02.062 --> 00:52:04.062
Dad is here with you.

00:52:05.404 --> 00:52:07.216
Don't be afraid, Soo-young.

00:52:08.013 --> 00:52:09.529
My son.

00:52:11.528 --> 00:52:13.263
You won't have to be in pain anymore.

00:52:19.464 --> 00:52:20.761
It's okay.

00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:23.379
It's okay now.

00:52:29.026 --> 00:52:30.426
It's okay.

00:52:32.299 --> 00:52:34.508
It's okay, it's okay.

00:52:46.350 --> 00:52:47.763
It's okay.

00:52:48.677 --> 00:52:50.194
He's gone now.

00:52:54.361 --> 00:52:55.950
It's okay to cry now.

00:53:51.505 --> 00:53:53.513
Oh.

00:53:55.319 --> 00:53:58.113
Soo-young left his phone with me.

00:54:00.461 --> 00:54:03.269
I think I should give it to you.

00:54:08.762 --> 00:54:09.919
Yes.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.609
(Favorites)

00:55:24.761 --> 00:55:25.974
Dad.

00:55:29.117 --> 00:55:31.230
At first, I thought I wouldn't say it.

00:55:32.791 --> 00:55:35.613
But I think I should
at least say thank you.

00:55:38.418 --> 00:55:40.517
Thank you for lying to me.

00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:43.611
Actually...

00:55:44.151 --> 00:55:46.345
I've already found my mom's social media.

00:55:47.008 --> 00:55:50.259
I know her phone
number too. I've found it all.

00:55:51.779 --> 00:55:53.783
I know you were afraid I'd be hurt,

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.600
so you said you couldn't find her.

00:56:01.282 --> 00:56:03.376
I was a little sad too.

00:56:06.308 --> 00:56:09.516
That my mom and my younger brother...

00:56:10.896 --> 00:56:14.322
Anyway, the fact that my
mom has another child...

00:56:18.112 --> 00:56:19.743
it couldn't be helped.

00:56:22.163 --> 00:56:23.775
I understand.

00:56:25.105 --> 00:56:28.189
So please don't hate Mom.

00:56:35.087 --> 00:56:36.751
Because...

00:56:39.008 --> 00:56:41.134
I already have a good father.

00:56:43.149 --> 00:56:45.064
That's enough.

00:56:51.921 --> 00:56:54.452
Thank you, Dad.

00:57:49.209 --> 00:57:52.251
Soo-young couldn't make it?

00:57:54.805 --> 00:57:56.628
Soo-young...

00:57:56.653 --> 00:57:59.736
wanted me to apologize for him.

00:57:59.821 --> 00:58:02.098
For not being able to keep
his promise to meet today.

00:58:07.856 --> 00:58:11.548
But we promised to meet today.

00:58:14.796 --> 00:58:16.085
That's right.

00:58:19.956 --> 00:58:22.026
But that's how it turned out.

00:58:23.362 --> 00:58:25.752
I'm sorry on his behalf.

00:58:27.379 --> 00:58:29.471
And...

00:58:29.496 --> 00:58:32.948
thank you for being a
good friend to Soo-young.

00:58:33.368 --> 00:58:34.963
Allowing him to have...

00:58:35.604 --> 00:58:37.885
a beautiful memory in his final moments.

00:58:39.277 --> 00:58:41.588
For creating a good memory for him,

00:58:41.613 --> 00:58:43.613
I'm very grateful to you.

00:58:44.225 --> 00:58:45.815
Soo-young...

00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:48.205
he didn't suffer much, did he?

00:58:50.334 --> 00:58:52.073
He told me

00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:54.893
that meeting you was his best day.

00:58:55.372 --> 00:58:57.658
He said it with a smile
and then fell asleep.

00:59:00.512 --> 00:59:01.713
Peacefully.

00:59:03.415 --> 00:59:05.186
Like he just fell asleep.

00:59:06.352 --> 00:59:09.174
Is Soo-young really gone?

00:59:10.606 --> 00:59:11.726
Yeah.

00:59:19.857 --> 00:59:21.873
(Special thanks to guest
actor Kwak Sun-young)

00:59:39.525 --> 00:59:42.503
Mary Kills People

00:59:42.528 --> 00:59:45.336
What you're doing
right now is too reckless.

00:59:45.361 --> 00:59:46.968
How did you become this kind of person?

00:59:46.993 --> 00:59:48.794
Is it okay to deceive
others for your own benefit?

00:59:48.818 --> 00:59:51.518
From now on, they'll
probably target us directly.

00:59:52.210 --> 00:59:53.274
Euthanasia.

00:59:53.299 --> 00:59:54.371
Isn't it euthanasia?

00:59:54.396 --> 00:59:55.565
What do you want?

00:59:55.729 --> 00:59:57.243
Don't cross my line, Woo So-jung.

00:59:57.268 --> 00:59:58.532
Do as I say.

00:59:58.557 --> 01:00:00.791
I'll do it. I can definitely do it.

01:00:00.836 --> 01:00:02.963
I asked what room number...

01:00:04.491 --> 01:00:06.479
What you're doing right now is murder.

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:09.432
I will catch you.

01:00:09.456 --> 01:00:11.456
