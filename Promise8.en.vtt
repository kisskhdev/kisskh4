[The Promise of the Soul]

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.980
[Episode 8: Was that person really you?]

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.440
Yu Chan.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.950
Yu Chan.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.600
Why are your eyebrows thicker?

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.340
And your nose higher?

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.130
Why did you kiss me?

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.030
You kissed me first.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.200
That was a misunderstanding.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.200
Explain yourself.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.079
I just had a dream.

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:30.650
I dreamed of my wife.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.870
And you both happen
to have a mole on your face.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.430
I mixed you up for a moment.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.130
You're using me as a stand-in.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.990
No, no.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.090
Honestly,

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.270
sometimes I see a red string on my hand.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.630
And it's tied to yours.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.110
So…

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.990
I suspect you're my wife's reincarnation.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.850
I'm this guy's wife?

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.370
Did you see that red string?

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.040
I'm confused too.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.290
We're both guys,

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.850
how could that be possible?

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.720
So what?

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.060
Possible or not,

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.150
you won't know unless you try.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.790
When I kissed you just now,

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.280
did you feel anything?

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.670
Just now…

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.010
I was still half-asleep.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.340
Then now that you're awake.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.070
What do you want?

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.380
Kiss you again to find out.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.780
No way.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.180
Why not?

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.440
I've been married to a woman.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.860
How could I be with a man?

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.740
That's why we need to try.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.590
No way.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.540
As long as you feel something, it's fine.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.030
I don't dare.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.500
I'm not used to it.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.450
Then why are you so used to
sleeping while holding me?

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:18.790
What if I don't like it?

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.300
If you don't like it,

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.830
I won't force you again.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.160
Didn't you say

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.990
we're connected by a red string?

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.000
Aren't you curious

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.030
what that means?

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.850
You could have
cleared that stage yesterday.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.250
Why did you call me
in the middle of the night to help you?

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.320
Don't ask, you'll be scared.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:58.909
Or…

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.660
Should I move in and sleep with you?

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.350
So yesterday was a rehearsal?

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.130
We haven't even started dating,
and we've already slept together?

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.430
What are you thinking?

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:15.670
That's because…

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.310
There was a cockroach on my bed.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.570
I didn't dare sleep alone.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:19.630
That's easy to fix.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.620
I'll go to your room later

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.350
and kill the cockroach for you.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.040
Forget it if you don't want.
I'll find someone else.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.970
You can't sleep with someone else.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.700
Chen Qiansui,
you just can't sleep with someone else.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:32.800
Did you hear me?

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.970
See, I'm this close to you,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.730
and you're not pushing me away.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.550
How can we bravely try?

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.270
Then try bravely just once.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.750
How can we bravely
try something like this?

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.790
Try what bravely?

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:02.920
Try what bravely?

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.310
Swimming.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.200
Bravely try swimming.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.870
Wait.

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:14.790
Say that again.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.070
I want to record it.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:18.380
Come on.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.710
I will bravely try swimming.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.670
If it's mine, it's mine.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.000
Let's see how long you can dodge.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:32.820
Off to swim.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:33.930
Qiansui, save me.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.220
I'm not going to swim.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.290
You already promised me.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.760
-Let's go to the pool.
-Let go.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.930
Come on, hurry.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.030
I can't swim.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:40.960
You can swim.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.260
Let go, let go.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.600
Don't squat down, come on.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.800
Let's go.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.550
Help!

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.640
Come on, hurry.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.780
Let me go.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.540
Xia Zefang.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:53.110
Xia Zefang.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:54.590
Come here a second.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.680
The teacher's calling me.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.370
Sir, this way please.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.260
Finally caught him.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.830
Forced fruit isn't sweet.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.560
Wait until he figures it out himself,
he'll come.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.640
Last time you told me not to worry,

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:19.840
and you volunteered to learn.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.470
I thought you'd be a natural.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.470
Couldn't you tell I was joking?

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.670
I take everything you say seriously.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:27.130
Come on.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.560
I don't want to.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:29.790
Hurry.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.880
Don't squat like him.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.980
Move faster.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.460
You said it yourself last time.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:34.570
Come on, let's go.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.860
At worst, you can do it.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.720
Rare to see you so down.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.740
Did your Ye ignore you?

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.580
How could he ignore me?

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.540
He's just afraid
that after seeing my grades,

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.770
he'll want to dump me.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.090
No way.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:07.690
I think you two

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:08.920
are fated.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.080
You can see it?

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.350
See what?

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:19.090
See your Ye coming back.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.570
Do you believe in lovers from a past life?

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:25.870
Why not?

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.740
If you find them,

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.220
shouldn't you hold on?

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:32.490
But…

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.740
What if you've got the wrong person?

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:37.049
What if I miss them?

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:54.850
Missing them is better
than never experiencing it.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:58.790
So much food...

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.760
How much for one bowl?

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.080
No idea.

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:03.860
A customer gave it to me.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.740
A female customer?

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.640
Up to no good?

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:09.740
Giving young men

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:10.780
oysters at night.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.420
Too bad…

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:22.030
I don't eat shellfish.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:23.410
You finish it.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.330
Next time don't bring back
late-night snacks.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:31.460
They'll make me fat.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.340
Maybe because Xia Zefang keeps swimming.

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:38.510
But you don't.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:43.870
Then why's your body so good

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.280
if you don't swim?

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.880
Don't run off every time you grope me.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.640
Why's your heart beating so fast?

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.260
Qiansui's not coming back tonight.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.460
I'll sleep in his bed.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.620
Finally no more floor mattress.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:10:59.950
Nervous?

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.390
It's not like
we haven't been alone before.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:04.890
Or…

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.610
Do you feel different about me?

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:13.980
I haven't showered yet.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.170
I'll go shower.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:23.270
Why is your face so red?

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.610
Must be from that bowl
of oysters just now.

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:30.080
Just youthful energy and a healthy body.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:30.900
Healthy body.

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:36.990
What do you think I'm going to do?

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.330
You're so close,

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.380
like you're about to kiss me.

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:45.440
You want it?

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.050
Since you saw the red string,

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:54.500
and someone at the temple
was promoting it today,

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.360
I happened to have it
blessed in the temple fire

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.240
for safety.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.740
Then…

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.520
Why do you have one too?

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.480
Can't I have protection?

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:08.840
Sure…

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:11.820
But I'm afraid people
will misunderstand us.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:12.860
What,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.090
is that not okay?

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.660
Didn't you say we're tied by a red string?

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.850
Wouldn't blocking your admirers
be a good thing?

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.300
Then give it back.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:22.370
Once given, it's given.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:23.830
Why would you take it back?

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:27.460
I just don't want people
saying bad things about you.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:32.680
If it's you,

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.970
then who cares if they talk?

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:39.050
Why are you so good to me?

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:43.210
I told you,

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.220
because it's you.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.770
Come down and swim.

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:56.500
I don't want to.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.440
Please.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.470
No.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:59.540
Come swim.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.480
Come on, you're already in swim trunks.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.510
You forced me into them.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:03.810
I think you need to be braver.

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:04.510
Braver.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:05.410
I'll be with you.

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.050
Come on.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:07.480
Go be brave yourself. Why pull me in?

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.520
I want to swim with you.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.260
That hurts.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:16.110
Are you okay?

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:18.500
Easy for you to say.
You can do it, of course it's easy.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.360
I'm here.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.890
I think you need to be braver.

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:22.900
With you here, I still choked last time.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.200
I drank the whole pool.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.280
You still remember something
from junior high school?

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.000
What else?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.500
You always force me like this.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.650
You only choked on one mouthful.

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:30.870
And you let go yourself.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.340
No way, you let go.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.540
You let go. How could I have let go?

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.200
The pool's completely empty.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.900
Xia Zefang's here.

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:41.280
It's not open on weekends.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.620
But I made an exception for Qiansui.

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:43.380
For me?

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.320
You're waiting for Xia Zefang, aren't you?

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:53.530
Are you hungry?

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.690
I'll make you instant noodles.

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:07.650
So you came anyway.

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:10.190
Didn't you say you're scared to swim?

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:12.950
When I was a kid,

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:15.140
someone drowned in front of me.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.120
I tried to save him,

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.290
but I almost...

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.220
In the end,

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.430
we didn't save him.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.620
Ever since, I've been afraid of water.

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:29.800
Now I just take baths at most.

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:34.170
Right now, this body is Xia Zefang's,

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:35.900
but the soul is Xia Cha.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:39.910
If Xia Zefang comes back for his body,

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:41.180
who could win?

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:42.810
Why fight over it?

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:44.380
Just give it back.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.070
If it were me,

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:50.780
I'd feel it was such a waste.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.520
If Zefang comes back,

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:57.560
treat him well.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.960
People probably want you back more.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.300
After all,

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.060
the current Xia Zefang

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.520
is much cuter than before.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:07.860
Zefang wasn't that bad, was he?

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.200
Wait.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:11.240
Now the only people

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.570
in the world who think

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:15.260
Xia Zefang's a good guy
are you and Guan Riqing.

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:26.870
Come on, lower your body.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:28.660
Let's push down.

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:29.620
Yes, yes, twist your waist.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:30.790
Body sideways a bit.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:31.690
Yes, sideways.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:32.760
Good, arms straight.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.560
Stretch.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.700
Like this?

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.800
Didn't expect you
to forget even the basic warm-up.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.300
No wonder you said you couldn't swim.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.230
I thought you were making excuses.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.110
So don't expect too much

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:48.610
from how well I'll swim.

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:52.410
Why do Qiansui and Haiyuan call you Cha?

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.020
This time I went back,

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:57.190
because of Grandpa's passing,

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:58.120
to remember him,

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:00.220
I decided to use his name,

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.190
a fresh start.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.500
You're really much better than before now.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.350
Was I really that bad before?

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.300
Hearing that your Cha's here

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:28.410
made you rush over.

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:29.380
I was nearby.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.840
So this is what you're like
when you're in love.

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:41.410
I'm not.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:47.030
The way you look at someone
you like never changes.

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:48.690
Look at how you look at him now.

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:53.210
Bend lower.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.390
Yes, arms like this.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:55.370
Pull your arms in.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:56.500
Yes, hold your arms.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:57.180
Hold arms?

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:04.319
You should see how you look at him.

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:09.079
I'm afraid you'll hit him.

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:13.650
You should be honest, too.

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:16.050
Watch out or he'll get stolen away.

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:26.390
Zefang,

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:28.069
I was afraid of water.

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:29.380
But you're not.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:30.810
This is your body.

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:32.370
When I let go later,

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:33.780
you have to hold on.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.000
Chen Qiansui,

00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:59.810
if Xia Zefang can, you can too.

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:00.390
Come on in.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.960
I don't want to.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.580
Your swim team isn't short on new members.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:03.410
Hurry.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:05.240
What are you doing?

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:06.930
Still running? Get back here.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:09.900
Attacking me?

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:27.900
Did you see that just now?

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:28.860
I can swim.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:29.740
I can swim!

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:31.670
Let's go eat.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.430
But I want to swim a bit more.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.640
You haven't swum in so long,

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.600
and you just hit the back of your head.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.000
That's enough for today.

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.680
I'll take you somewhere delicious, okay?

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:42.270
Okay.

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:43.220
Then wait for me.

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:48.250
Wait for me.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:13.950
Ye Haiyuan.

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:17.430
That tickles!

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.080
Let me rinse off first, okay?

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:29.080
Ye Haiyuan, what are you doing?

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:45.260
Stop hitting him!

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:47.450
Jiang Bailing, Chen Qiansui!

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:54.430
Stop hitting him.

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:56.350
You're not a fighting dog.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:04.860
What's wrong?

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:13.740
Ye Haiyuan.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.210
What?

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:18.380
Haiyuan!

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:19.880
Ye Haiyuan!

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:22.360
Ye Haiyuan!

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:23.680
Come here.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.090
Can you stop being so childish?

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:28.260
Hitting without asking,

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.190
then turning away?

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:30.260
He's more mature?

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:31.760
Then go to him.

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:34.110
Ye Haiyuan.

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:35.160
Are you crazy?

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:35.980
Yes.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:37.320
The crazy one is me.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.600
I thought I mattered to you.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.890
And?

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:42.950
And what?

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:44.330
What did you see?

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.650
I had soap all over my head.

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:51.140
I couldn't see who it was.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.790
You couldn’t even see,
and you were still that passionate?

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:54.630
Or maybe…

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:56.850
This body likes him more.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.650
Why are you saying things so nasty?

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:07.120
I thought it was you.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.200
There was no one else in the pool.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.530
Who else would do that

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:12.330
to me there?

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.520
How do I know it was Guan Riqing?

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.140
How can you not tell the difference?

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.230
Or…

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:23.900
Are we not close enough for you to tell?

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.120
How are you
any different from Guan Riqing?

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.630
Just because you know my secret

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:44.060
doesn't mean
you can treat me however you want.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.460
I don't want to argue with you now.

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:50.750
Let's cool off for a while.

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:05.410
[Got the question wrong,
wrote the wrong answer, not my intention.]

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:07.630
[Can you not be so mad?]

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.920
Sir, I'm really happy to see you.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.090
Wait, wait.

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:12.660
I've never seen the teacher

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.120
so popular with students.

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:15.950
Sir, any instructions?

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:17.400
One good news,

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.330
one bad news.

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:19.430
Congratulations,

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:21.340
you won an award for calligraphy.

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:24.590
That's great!

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:25.630
I didn't expect it.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:27.130
And one bad news.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:30.850
You didn't do

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:32.000
very well this time.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:34.910
Looks like you'll need
to win lots more awards.

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:37.420
Weren't you just with Bailing?

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:38.400
Swimming.

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:39.650
Swimming's a popular

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:41.190
extra credit item lately.

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:43.300
Isn't that just what you're good at?

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:45.340
Since hitting my head,

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:47.660
I can't anymore.

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:50.520
Xia Zefang,

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:52.470
it's like riding a bike.

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:54.780
If you don't ride for a long time,
you'll be scared.

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.680
But our bodies have memory.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:25.490

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:20.860
You're still mad?

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.700
Quit acting pitiful.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:24.190
If you're a man,

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.690
show your true heart.

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:28.400
Just let me hold you, that's all.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.270
So it's true

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:31.040
that love really changes people.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.300
Who said we're in love?

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:33.340
You're not?

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.880
You two even sleep hugging each other.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.380
Haiyuan's mine.

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:38.490
Do you dare?

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:39.880
Loser has to do

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.210
whatever the winner says.

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:41.850
Bet's on.

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:42.650
Who's afraid?

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.320
What do I do?

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:46.040
I think…

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:47.690
I like you too much.
