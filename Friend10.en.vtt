WEBVTT

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:36.834
I’ll have a matcha honey lemon and a pink milk, please.

00:01:38.334 --> 00:01:40.542
Who said I will drink the matcha honey lemon?

00:01:40.751 --> 00:01:42.667
Who said I buy it for you?

00:01:42.834 --> 00:01:47.709
Huh? Wow. You never treat your friends

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:51.459
but when it comes to her, suddenly you’re a big spender.

00:01:57.667 --> 00:02:00.584
We’re almost graduating today

00:02:00.584 --> 00:02:02.459
there is something I want to say...

00:02:02.542 --> 00:02:04.125
I like you.

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:07.500
Whoa, are you in high school or something?

00:02:07.876 --> 00:02:12.125
My whole heart…It belongs to you and only you.

00:02:12.417 --> 00:02:14.626
Ugh, goosebumps.

00:02:17.542 --> 00:02:19.667
Just take it already, okay?

00:02:24.042 --> 00:02:27.834
Where are you Jin? I’ve been waiting forever.

00:02:42.417 --> 00:02:43.000
Kanit

00:02:48.417 --> 00:02:50.709
What’s the occasion?

00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:54.876
Well… it’s because we’ve known each other for a long time.

00:02:56.167 --> 00:03:00.209
And… I really like you.

00:03:02.042 --> 00:03:03.500
We’re about to graduate.

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.042
I’m scared I’ll miss the chance to tell you—like I did last time

00:03:07.292 --> 00:03:08.959
I’ve always wanted to see you.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.250
but…

00:03:17.876 --> 00:03:19.125
Will you be with me?

00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:22.000
Kanit....

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.999
I’ve never thought of you as more than a friend.

00:03:43.542 --> 00:03:47.375
Could you maybe think back on your feelings?

00:04:12.292 --> 00:04:13.751
Where are you going?

00:04:22.334 --> 00:04:24.667
Jin, What are you doing?

00:04:27.584 --> 00:04:29.083
What are you doing?

00:04:33.751 --> 00:04:35.751
Why won’t you answer?

00:04:43.584 --> 00:04:44.999
Kanit

00:04:48.042 --> 00:04:51.000
Every time before the semester break since we studied here,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I always stopped myself.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.751
Stopped myself from telling you how I feel… or asking you out.

00:05:02.542 --> 00:05:04.250
But today

00:05:05.417 --> 00:05:07.542
This is our final semester.

00:05:09.334 --> 00:05:11.959
I don’t know what’s gonna happen after this.

00:05:12.876 --> 00:05:15.709
But I’m scared I won’t get another chance to say it.

00:05:20.292 --> 00:05:21.918
I like you.

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:25.292
Can we be together?

00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:31.125
Jin

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:36.125
I feel the same way.

00:05:45.083 --> 00:05:47.292
But can we just stay friends?

00:05:50.125 --> 00:05:51.709
Kanit is afraid that

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.125
Kanit will lose Jin.

00:05:58.125 --> 00:05:59.209
What if…

00:06:03.083 --> 00:06:08.042
One day Jin didn't feel this way

00:06:08.042 --> 00:06:09.999
I don't think like this anymore.

00:06:11.667 --> 00:06:13.792
We will never meet again.

00:06:21.834 --> 00:06:23.792
Will we see each other again?

00:06:28.584 --> 00:06:30.250
How?

00:06:31.167 --> 00:06:33.584
I’m going to help with a theater project in Khao Yai.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.626
Can we give this feeling some time?

00:06:45.334 --> 00:06:48.250
Let’s not rush into anything until we’re really sure.

00:06:56.792 --> 00:06:58.626
Let’s not start something

00:06:58.626 --> 00:07:00.542
until we’re really sure.

00:07:43.125 --> 00:07:44.792
Why are you acting so weird?

00:07:44.792 --> 00:07:46.500
You seem way too excited.

00:07:47.417 --> 00:07:50.999
What if I tell her and she rejects me? What am I gonna do?

00:07:51.626 --> 00:07:53.042
Well… at least you told her, right?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.459
If you want to keep it,

00:07:55.459 --> 00:07:57.459
Then go back, no need to go.

00:07:57.667 --> 00:07:58.876
I’m not turning back.

00:08:01.125 --> 00:08:05.751
Fine. But be ready… it might not go how you hope.

00:08:10.626 --> 00:08:13.417
I really hope he says yes.

00:08:15.375 --> 00:08:16.500
I’ll walk you there.

00:08:18.083 --> 00:08:19.709
It’s okay. I’ll go on my own.

00:08:48.167 --> 00:08:49.334
You’re acting kinda strange…

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.167
Strange?

00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.959
Is there something you want to tell me?

00:09:14.792 --> 00:09:17.292
Um…

00:09:18.584 --> 00:09:19.918
I…

00:09:26.167 --> 00:09:26.834
Um…

00:09:26.959 --> 00:09:28.459
So you like me, right?

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.751
What I want to say is

00:09:37.584 --> 00:09:41.250
I’ve liked you ever since the day you put your jacket over my skirt.

00:09:42.083 --> 00:09:44.500
From that day until now…

00:09:44.792 --> 00:09:47.334
I haven’t been able to stop liking you.

00:09:51.083 --> 00:09:53.542
But I only see you as a little sister.

00:09:56.792 --> 00:09:59.500
Thank you… for the sweet feelings you have for me.

00:10:01.626 --> 00:10:04.167
But soon I have to go back to work at home.

00:10:04.167 --> 00:10:06.626
And then we won't meet again.

00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:09.959
We will see each other again.

00:10:12.834 --> 00:10:17.250
Let’s not go any further than this, okay?

00:10:20.542 --> 00:10:25.500
One day, I’ll make you feel the same way I feel about you.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:29.042
I know you like someone else

00:10:29.042 --> 00:10:31.792
but can you give me a chance?

00:10:33.042 --> 00:10:36.000
I’ll be by your side

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.792
and I promise I’ll never hurt you.

00:10:40.709 --> 00:10:42.500
Thank you again.

00:10:46.292 --> 00:10:48.500
But I don’t want you to get hurt

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.959
if I can’t feel the same way.

00:10:51.584 --> 00:10:55.167
As for whether we’ll meet again—let’s leave that to the future.

00:10:56.959 --> 00:10:59.167
Right now

00:10:59.167 --> 00:11:02.083
focus on your studies.

00:11:02.083 --> 00:11:04.209
Read a lot.

00:11:04.209 --> 00:11:07.542
I won’t be tutoring you anymore, so review on your own, okay?

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:10.626
Okay… Lalin.

00:11:15.709 --> 00:11:16.918
I’ll go now.

00:11:38.125 --> 00:11:39.584
Lalin…

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.500
One day, I’ll make you my girlfriend.

00:11:55.209 --> 00:11:58.834
This past year, we’ve done our best running the resort

00:11:58.834 --> 00:12:02.250
but the results still aren’t what Dad used to make.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:03.751
As for the café…

00:12:03.751 --> 00:12:08.375
I’d like you to help develop some special menu items,

00:12:08.375 --> 00:12:10.083
using ingredients from our farm here.

00:12:10.626 --> 00:12:13.083
Sure. My team and I will give it our all.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.918
And as for you…

00:12:16.918 --> 00:12:21.000
Could you help manage the resort and farm stay?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.292
Just like how Dad used to take care of everything.

00:12:23.292 --> 00:12:25.417
I’ll handle the promotions myself.

00:12:25.959 --> 00:12:27.042
Of course, Miss Lalin.

00:12:27.375 --> 00:12:29.542
I’m counting on all of you.

00:12:29.918 --> 00:12:31.999
Let’s build something great together.

00:12:31.999 --> 00:12:34.292
Do your part with all your heart.

00:12:35.334 --> 00:12:36.542
Thank you all so much.

00:12:52.167 --> 00:12:53.667
Start by creating an atmosphere

00:12:53.876 --> 00:12:55.751
Customers will be impressed

00:12:56.042 --> 00:12:58.999
Feel comfortable when they come in

00:12:59.584 --> 00:13:03.292
But Som is starting to feel unwell.

00:13:03.292 --> 00:13:05.459
It's like I have a backache or something.

00:13:05.459 --> 00:13:08.751
Ugh, same. My arms are sore too—from lifting heavy stuff.

00:13:10.083 --> 00:13:11.375
What do you mean?

00:13:11.375 --> 00:13:13.542
You and Took barely lifted anything.

00:13:13.542 --> 00:13:15.000
Jin didn’t even complain!

00:13:16.626 --> 00:13:18.709
Not complaining doesn't mean you're not tired.

00:13:18.709 --> 00:13:19.542
I just don’t say it out loud.

00:13:19.999 --> 00:13:20.876
Oh—

00:13:22.417 --> 00:13:23.709
Just kidding.

00:13:23.709 --> 00:13:24.751
I’m totally fine.

00:13:24.876 --> 00:13:26.834
Back when I helped my parents on the farm

00:13:26.834 --> 00:13:27.999
it was way tougher than this.

00:13:28.792 --> 00:13:32.584
Maybe we should hire a guy to help out?

00:13:33.292 --> 00:13:34.209
That’d be great!

00:13:35.751 --> 00:13:37.876
Well… there’s a catch.

00:13:41.584 --> 00:13:42.792
What kind of catch?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.542
Tuk and Som, one of them might have to leave.

00:13:47.792 --> 00:13:49.751
So that we can add more male employees.

00:13:51.292 --> 00:13:53.042
No need to hire anymore!

00:14:06.459 --> 00:14:09.042
Oh wow—so strong all of a sudden.

00:14:09.083 --> 00:14:10.000
Feeling great! No back pain at all.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.125
You sure?

00:14:12.999 --> 00:14:14.626
You can take a break, y’know.

00:14:15.334 --> 00:14:16.042
No need! I’m totally fine.

00:14:16.042 --> 00:14:16.709
Want help?

00:14:18.209 --> 00:14:20.125
Nope. Got it. Easy peasy.

00:14:24.626 --> 00:14:26.792
Exhausted before the café even opens.

00:14:26.792 --> 00:14:28.417
How can I survive the shift?

00:14:29.751 --> 00:14:31.167
Still wanna hire a male employee?

00:14:31.918 --> 00:14:33.000
Nope!

00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:37.292
This part’s done. I’ll go open the café now.

00:14:38.042 --> 00:14:39.667
So hardworking…

00:14:39.667 --> 00:14:41.999
whoever ends up dating you is gonna have it easy for life.

00:14:42.209 --> 00:14:45.209
Oh my god. You two are flirting again?

00:14:45.542 --> 00:14:47.000
When are you finally going to get together?

00:14:47.125 --> 00:14:49.751
You’ve been teasing each other since college.

00:14:49.751 --> 00:14:51.417
Still doing it even now.

00:14:51.792 --> 00:14:52.751
Yes

00:14:52.751 --> 00:14:55.083
You're so good at flirting, you should open a Thai coconut pancake shop.

00:14:55.125 --> 00:14:57.626
It would be better than being a cafe manager.

00:14:59.918 --> 00:15:01.292
Okay, now you’re getting on my nerves.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.209
Kanit, how about we hire someone else?

00:15:04.209 --> 00:15:05.375
Doesn’t even have to be a guy.

00:15:05.918 --> 00:15:09.250
Whoa, getting defensive already?

00:15:09.584 --> 00:15:11.667
Took was just joking!

00:15:12.209 --> 00:15:14.000
So… interested in opening a dessert stall with me?

00:15:14.751 --> 00:15:15.792
Took. Som.

00:15:15.792 --> 00:15:17.709
I don’t like these kinds of jokes.

00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:19.083
Can you guys please stop already?

00:15:52.459 --> 00:15:54.334
Are you okay, Kanit?

00:15:54.334 --> 00:15:56.459
Why are you so upset with Took and Som?

00:15:58.209 --> 00:16:01.375
It’s just… I don’t want people to get the wrong idea about us.

00:16:02.375 --> 00:16:04.626
I think it’s better that we stay just friends.

00:16:11.083 --> 00:16:12.876
I understand…

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.167
but they were just teasing. It wasn’t serious.

00:16:17.042 --> 00:16:19.959
I like to tease you like this and never stop.

00:16:19.959 --> 00:16:21.584
It's not good.

00:16:21.584 --> 00:16:24.042
And Jin himself will be damaged too.

00:16:24.083 --> 00:16:29.167
We’re not even dating, and they keep making jokes like that.

00:16:29.167 --> 00:16:31.417
If someone overhears it, they could totally misunderstand.

00:16:39.167 --> 00:16:42.000
Okay… I’ll talk to them and ask them to stop.

00:16:43.751 --> 00:16:45.500
Let’s get back to work.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.876
Help me prep.

00:16:47.876 --> 00:16:50.334
If customers come in and we’re not ready, that’ll be a real problem.

00:17:02.042 --> 00:17:03.459
Hello! What can I get for you?

00:17:03.459 --> 00:17:04.125
Hello

00:17:04.709 --> 00:17:06.709
I’ll have an iced cappuccino, less sweet.

00:17:09.334 --> 00:17:10.417
And a slice of strawberry cake, please.

00:17:10.542 --> 00:17:12.209
Sure! For here or to go?

00:17:12.417 --> 00:17:13.042
For here.

00:17:13.209 --> 00:17:14.000
Got it.

00:17:15.125 --> 00:17:16.626
That’ll be 275 baht.

00:17:16.626 --> 00:17:18.000
275, scan .

00:17:26.876 --> 00:17:27.709
Here you go.

00:17:27.834 --> 00:17:28.542
Thank you so much.

00:17:28.542 --> 00:17:31.375
All set! You can take a seat while you wait. Thank you!

00:17:31.375 --> 00:17:32.542
Thank you

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.125
Here’s your dessert!

00:17:56.667 --> 00:17:57.626
Enjoy your treats!

00:17:57.626 --> 00:17:58.459
Thank you

00:18:10.792 --> 00:18:13.459
Please help take care of all the plants, okay?

00:18:13.459 --> 00:18:13.999
Of course.

00:18:13.999 --> 00:18:15.834
Take good care of them, please.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.584
Also, any light that isn’t working

00:18:19.751 --> 00:18:21.626
please help replace it.

00:18:21.626 --> 00:18:23.792
The vibe in the café really matters.

00:18:23.792 --> 00:18:26.999
I want everyone who comes in to feel completely relaxed.

00:18:27.751 --> 00:18:30.042
Especially because this zone will be open at night too.

00:18:30.459 --> 00:18:31.584
Got it, Miss Lalin.

00:18:31.584 --> 00:18:32.751
all on you

00:18:38.042 --> 00:18:39.417
Oh, hey Lalin!

00:18:39.834 --> 00:18:41.167
Hey Dim.

00:18:41.167 --> 00:18:42.500
What are you doing here?

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:43.834
Working, obviously.

00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:46.999
And you?

00:18:46.999 --> 00:18:48.459
Waking up late again?

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:49.250
Have you eaten?

00:18:50.167 --> 00:18:51.417
Not yet.

00:18:51.417 --> 00:18:53.250
I was thinking I’d grab something from the café.

00:18:55.542 --> 00:18:57.999
Oh, so you’re here to help, huh?

00:18:58.709 --> 00:19:02.834
Woke up late and now you want free food too?

00:19:02.959 --> 00:19:04.500
Why are you being so stingy with your little bro?

00:19:04.792 --> 00:19:07.751
I’ve got exams right now, so maybe I’ve been sleeping in a bit…

00:19:09.125 --> 00:19:11.125
Why are you being so stingy with your little bro?

00:19:11.918 --> 00:19:13.209
You’re not gonna eat real food first?

00:19:13.959 --> 00:19:15.999
Nope. I just want something sweet.

00:19:16.626 --> 00:19:20.834
Fine, suit yourself. But don’t forget to study hard too.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.626
Got it, P’Lalin.

00:19:22.626 --> 00:19:23.834
Let me know if you need help with anything.

00:19:24.292 --> 00:19:26.209
How about starting by waking up earlier?

00:19:26.209 --> 00:19:28.459
Make the most of your day.

00:19:29.167 --> 00:19:31.542
I’m off. I have a client meeting.

00:19:39.959 --> 00:19:42.209
One iced mocha, and a brookie please.

00:19:42.792 --> 00:19:44.292
Charge it to Lalin’s tab—like always.

00:19:44.542 --> 00:19:47.125
You drink coffee now, Dim?

00:19:47.667 --> 00:19:50.709
Why not, P’Jin? I’m not a kid anymore.

00:19:52.083 --> 00:19:53.959
Alright, I’ll get it ready.

00:19:55.876 --> 00:19:58.167
Last month, Lalin's account was higher.

00:19:58.918 --> 00:20:02.083
Because the owner's younger brother orders two or three cups a day.

00:20:06.876 --> 00:20:08.292
Just like you, P’Lalin.

00:20:10.083 --> 00:20:12.083
Okay okay, I’ll cut down a bit.

00:20:12.083 --> 00:20:13.500
Help save some money.

00:20:13.959 --> 00:20:15.709
Good boy. Easy to teach.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.751
Go take a seat. I’ll bring it over.

00:20:18.999 --> 00:20:19.876
Thanks!

00:20:33.125 --> 00:20:36.042
This customer’s been here for hours.

00:20:36.999 --> 00:20:39.834
Only ordered one drink and one slice of cake.

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:42.459
Is she planning to sit here all day?

00:20:43.792 --> 00:20:47.667
It’s fine. Other customers still have seats, right?

00:20:48.542 --> 00:20:50.918
Kanit’s handled this kind of thing before.

00:20:50.918 --> 00:20:51.834
I will talk to her.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.918
But maybe they understood what you explained.

00:20:55.918 --> 00:20:57.417
Everyone’s different, y’know.

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:00.792
Still, if we let it slide, they might keep doing it.

00:21:01.125 --> 00:21:05.125
Look—two seats are open but she is using a table for three.

00:21:05.751 --> 00:21:07.542
Shouldn’t someone go say something?

00:21:07.999 --> 00:21:10.375
Let it go, Kanit. Just leave it.

00:21:11.292 --> 00:21:13.167
No worries.

00:21:13.167 --> 00:21:14.417
Let’s just watch how it goes.

00:21:16.709 --> 00:21:18.667
It’s okay. I’ll go.

00:21:32.375 --> 00:21:34.167
Excuse me

00:21:34.167 --> 00:21:36.000
would you like to order anything else?

00:21:36.417 --> 00:21:37.250
No.

00:21:39.083 --> 00:21:40.876
In that case

00:21:40.876 --> 00:21:45.459
would you mind moving to the two-seat table over there?

00:21:47.834 --> 00:21:49.999
Why? Can’t I sit here?

00:21:51.834 --> 00:21:53.792
If customers want to sit for a long time

00:21:53.792 --> 00:21:55.834
That way might be more convenient.

00:21:57.375 --> 00:21:59.584
So what if I’m staying long?

00:21:59.584 --> 00:22:00.918
I’m waiting for a friend.

00:22:01.417 --> 00:22:02.584
Or is there a problem?

00:22:05.042 --> 00:22:06.542
No problem at all.

00:22:07.292 --> 00:22:14.375
It’s just that we try to keep larger tables open for big groups.

00:22:18.042 --> 00:22:19.792
Why are all of you standing here?

00:22:20.167 --> 00:22:21.876
We heard some raised voices

00:22:21.876 --> 00:22:24.167
so we came to check if everything’s okay.

00:22:24.959 --> 00:22:26.083
Who’s the manager?

00:22:26.959 --> 00:22:28.584
That would be me. Can I help you with anything?

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:29.918
Perfect.

00:22:29.918 --> 00:22:34.334
Then please teach your staff some basic manners.

00:22:36.042 --> 00:22:38.999
No wonder there are few customers these days.

00:22:39.125 --> 00:22:41.209
Because there are bad service staff like this.

00:22:44.709 --> 00:22:45.250
Move.

00:22:53.876 --> 00:22:55.083
Out of my way.

00:22:59.292 --> 00:23:01.000
What exactly did you say to that customer?

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.709
Why did she storm out like that?

00:23:04.083 --> 00:23:06.334
Just ask if you want anything else.

00:23:06.334 --> 00:23:08.792
Just tell them to move to that table over there.

00:23:09.292 --> 00:23:13.500
That’s all! Didn’t think it would blow up like that.

00:23:15.876 --> 00:23:18.292
Alright then… I’ll go clear her table.

00:23:18.375 --> 00:23:19.792
What’s going on?

00:23:19.792 --> 00:23:21.250
Why is someone posting bad things about our café?

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:24.250
Huh? That's so fast…

00:23:44.459 --> 00:23:46.334
So weird.

00:23:46.334 --> 00:23:49.500
Jin’s never had any problems with customers before.

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:52.667
How did something like this even happen?

00:23:53.959 --> 00:23:58.292
Well… we all know every customer is different.

00:23:59.626 --> 00:24:02.918
Please, let’s make sure something like this doesn’t happen again.

00:24:04.375 --> 00:24:06.209
I’m sorry, Khun Lin.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:07.999
It was my idea… I told...

00:24:07.999 --> 00:24:11.792
No, it’s my fault. I’m really sorry.

00:24:13.542 --> 00:24:15.083
We’re a team.

00:24:15.334 --> 00:24:18.125
If something goes wrong, we all take responsibility together.

00:24:19.459 --> 00:24:21.918
Yeah. We’re in this as a team.

00:24:21.918 --> 00:24:23.459
Kanit just wants to say that

00:24:23.459 --> 00:24:25.292
Kanit saw the customer sitting for a long time.

00:24:25.292 --> 00:24:27.584
And then sit in the third place.

00:24:27.584 --> 00:24:29.292
So I wanted him to move his seat.

00:24:29.292 --> 00:24:31.375
But Jin saw it and went instead.

00:24:31.584 --> 00:24:32.876
But...

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.250
But Kanit is a manager.

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:37.334
If you are at fault, you must take responsibility.

00:24:40.042 --> 00:24:42.042
So… what do we do next?

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.042
We don’t know if the customer’s gonna stop at just a bad review.

00:24:46.999 --> 00:24:50.083
Should we do something to apologize?

00:24:51.292 --> 00:24:52.918
Then… may Kanit reach out and apologize to her.

00:24:53.375 --> 00:24:54.709
Alright. No problem.

00:24:57.417 --> 00:24:59.417
Sorry—let me take this call from home real quick.

00:25:05.292 --> 00:25:06.542
Hello? What is it, Mom?

00:25:06.542 --> 00:25:11.083
Som… your mom’s in the hospital right now.

00:25:11.083 --> 00:25:13.417
She suddenly collapsed this morning.

00:25:13.417 --> 00:25:15.918
The doctor says she has a brain hemorrhage

00:25:15.918 --> 00:25:18.500
might end up partially paralyzed.

00:25:20.626 --> 00:25:22.083
…Mom

00:25:23.417 --> 00:25:25.250
What’s wrong? What happened?

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:26.334
What’s going on?

00:25:28.083 --> 00:25:31.626
He said my mom has a brain bleed.

00:25:34.083 --> 00:25:36.209
Kanit, Jin—please take care of the café.

00:25:36.792 --> 00:25:38.083
Tuk, Som, come with me.

00:25:45.667 --> 00:25:47.834
I’m really worried about Som and her mom…

00:25:47.834 --> 00:25:50.334
We don’t even know how they’re doing right now.

00:25:50.334 --> 00:25:52.709
Lalin and Tuk haven’t come back either.

00:25:53.334 --> 00:25:56.959
Umm… a brain bleed is seriously dangerous.

00:25:57.999 --> 00:26:00.334
I really hope her mom’s gonna be okay.

00:26:04.584 --> 00:26:06.417
Wait… you believe in stuff like that?

00:26:06.417 --> 00:26:08.000
You never seemed like the type.

00:26:08.834 --> 00:26:10.667
Sometimes… you just need something to hold onto.

00:26:11.042 --> 00:26:11.999
What about you?

00:26:13.375 --> 00:26:14.417
I believe…

00:26:14.999 --> 00:26:17.792
And I also believe we didn’t meet by accident.

00:26:19.209 --> 00:26:20.375
What do you mean?

00:26:21.584 --> 00:26:24.375
I think… every encounter happens for a reason.

00:26:24.751 --> 00:26:26.959
Whether it’s to stay together

00:26:26.959 --> 00:26:29.834
or to part ways—every person leaves us with something.

00:26:30.709 --> 00:26:32.375
No one crosses paths by coincidence.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:46.250
Hello, I’m here to apply for a job.

00:26:48.459 --> 00:26:50.417
We were just talking about coincidences.

00:26:50.417 --> 00:26:51.959
I guess this isn’t one.

00:26:53.292 --> 00:26:54.999
Is something wrong?

00:26:55.292 --> 00:26:56.375
No

00:26:56.876 --> 00:27:00.000
just wanted to say we’re not hiring at the moment.

00:27:00.959 --> 00:27:02.542
But I do feel for her.

00:27:02.542 --> 00:27:04.876
She looks like she come with all her stuff, like she’s moving in.

00:27:08.542 --> 00:27:10.959
Can I see P'Lalin first?

00:27:10.959 --> 00:27:12.999
then I'll go back to Bangkok afterward.

00:27:13.751 --> 00:27:14.834
Sure

00:27:14.834 --> 00:27:16.876
want to take a seat and rest first?

00:27:16.876 --> 00:27:18.542
Would you like a glass of water? My treat.

00:27:19.167 --> 00:27:21.083
No, thank you. I’m fine.

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:25.417
How did she get here?

00:27:25.667 --> 00:27:28.209
No idea. Coincidence, maybe.

00:27:29.167 --> 00:27:30.918
See? It’s real.

00:27:37.209 --> 00:27:39.250
Drink some water.

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:41.709
I’m rooting for you. Keep fighting.

00:27:42.042 --> 00:27:43.375
Thank you.

00:28:12.792 --> 00:28:15.584
How’s Som’s mom doing, Lalin?

00:28:16.209 --> 00:28:17.918
The doctor said she had a stroke.

00:28:17.918 --> 00:28:19.709
Her arms and legs are weak.

00:28:19.709 --> 00:28:22.042
So I told Som to stay and take care of her mom.

00:28:23.375 --> 00:28:25.542
Kanit, keep paying her salary.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000
And when her mom gets better, she can come back to work.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Hey, Dalan! what are you doing here?

00:28:39.667 --> 00:28:42.667
I come to apply for a job, but all positions are filled.

00:28:43.209 --> 00:28:45.792
So I’m waiting to see you before heading back.

00:28:47.792 --> 00:28:50.375
But Som isn’t here. She’s with her mom.

00:28:50.375 --> 00:28:52.542
Looks like we’re short one staff member now.

00:28:53.834 --> 00:28:55.083
That’s true.

00:28:55.083 --> 00:28:57.167
Maybe Dalan can fill in for Som.

00:28:57.167 --> 00:28:59.751
But what if Som comes back?

00:29:03.959 --> 00:29:06.918
Alright then. Dalan, you can start tomorrow.

00:29:07.042 --> 00:29:09.626
Be here at 7 AM sharp. No being late.

00:29:10.876 --> 00:29:12.459
Thank you so much.

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.250
Oh, one more thing.

00:29:16.292 --> 00:29:19.500
The staff accommodation isn’t available right now.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.292
Where will you stay?

00:29:21.751 --> 00:29:24.834
I already checked out a place nearby before coming to apply.

00:29:27.626 --> 00:29:32.083
Tuk, can you show Dalan to her place?

00:29:32.584 --> 00:29:33.209
Sure.

00:29:33.209 --> 00:29:34.209
Take care of Dalan, okay?

00:29:35.042 --> 00:29:37.500
Dalan, go get some rest and come to work tomorrow.

00:29:38.292 --> 00:29:40.083
I’ll head off now. See you all. See you.

00:29:40.334 --> 00:29:41.500
Let's go Dalan.

00:29:44.167 --> 00:29:47.000
Thanks, P'Lalin, P'Jin, P'Kanit

00:29:49.375 --> 00:29:51.000
I’ll go grab my bag.

00:29:54.626 --> 00:29:56.417
What is going on?

00:29:56.417 --> 00:29:58.417
Why are you hiring her this easily?

00:29:58.999 --> 00:30:02.209
You’re not even checking her profile or experience?

00:30:03.459 --> 00:30:06.083
Well, I know Dalan already.

00:30:06.083 --> 00:30:09.042
She’s a good girl. Nothing wrong with her attitude.

00:30:10.751 --> 00:30:12.709
And do you apologize to the customer?

00:30:12.959 --> 00:30:14.459
All done. Don’t worry.

00:30:14.751 --> 00:30:16.792
I explained and apologized properly.

00:30:19.334 --> 00:30:21.209
So much drama lately.

00:30:21.542 --> 00:30:25.000
Dad must’ve been so exhausted handling things alone.

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.834
Lin, don’t keep saying you’re tired.

00:30:28.834 --> 00:30:30.584
It affects your motivation.

00:30:31.292 --> 00:30:33.584
Words impact the mind, you know?

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.918
Alright, I won’t say it then.

00:30:37.626 --> 00:30:40.125
Wow, It's so fresh!

00:30:41.083 --> 00:30:43.042
That's sarcasm.

00:30:43.667 --> 00:30:45.334
Just messing with you.

00:31:00.751 --> 00:31:01.542
Done.

00:31:09.334 --> 00:31:11.083
Ready to start learning the job?

00:31:11.083 --> 00:31:13.125
If you’re ready, let’s get going.

00:31:13.999 --> 00:31:15.334
Jin, take care of Dalan.

00:31:15.999 --> 00:31:17.042
Touk, let’s get the stuff ready.

00:31:19.125 --> 00:31:20.042
Okay.

00:31:23.042 --> 00:31:25.918
First, we’ll take customer orders here.

00:31:26.042 --> 00:31:29.999
Then we’ll bring their orders to their tables in order.

00:31:30.125 --> 00:31:33.584
Sometimes there might be elderly customers who don’t quite get it

00:31:33.584 --> 00:31:36.125
we can go serve them directly too.

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.792
It’s not fixed. Just go with the flow.

00:31:39.751 --> 00:31:43.959
Oh, and if you see someone’s been waiting a while

00:31:43.959 --> 00:31:46.792
you can offer them water first.

00:31:46.792 --> 00:31:48.959
It helps them feel more at ease while waiting.

00:31:56.709 --> 00:31:59.918
Okay. Also, this one too.

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:04.292
Dalan, your first customer is coming.

00:32:13.167 --> 00:32:16.500
P’ Tuk, P’ Lalin is our boss, not a customer.

00:32:17.125 --> 00:32:21.417
Yes, but every morning Boss Lalin comes for her matcha...

00:32:21.417 --> 00:32:22.709
honey lemon.

00:32:23.626 --> 00:32:25.626
But I don’t know how to make it.

00:32:25.918 --> 00:32:27.542
No worries, I’ll make it for you.

00:32:27.542 --> 00:32:29.125
You just take it to Boss Lalin.

00:32:34.792 --> 00:32:37.584
P’ Tuk, I have a question.

00:32:37.999 --> 00:32:43.083
Why do you, P’ Jin, and P’ Som all call P’ Laliin “Khun Lalin”?

00:32:43.083 --> 00:32:43.167
I’ve heard it since university.
Why do you, P’ Jin, and P’ Som all call P’ Laliin “Khun Lalin”?

00:32:43.167 --> 00:32:44.999
I’ve heard it since university.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.292
Dalan, you’re such a curious one.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.417
You’re not teasing me, are you?

00:32:52.959 --> 00:32:54.500
Nope.

00:32:54.542 --> 00:32:57.167
It’s good to ask when you’re curious.

00:32:57.167 --> 00:32:59.918
But sometimes, also check if it’s okay to ask.

00:33:01.459 --> 00:33:03.292
So… was it okay to ask that just now?

00:33:04.709 --> 00:33:07.000
Jin is waiting to answer, so I guess yes.

00:33:07.292 --> 00:33:09.876
Hey, don’t gang up on the new girl.

00:33:09.959 --> 00:33:11.459
We call her “Khun Lalin”

00:33:11.459 --> 00:33:15.626
because her family has always helped ours.

00:33:15.876 --> 00:33:18.083
Her dad even helped pay for our education

00:33:18.083 --> 00:33:20.709
gave us money for rent, and gave us monthly support

00:33:20.709 --> 00:33:22.083
like we were his own kids.

00:33:22.083 --> 00:33:23.542
That’s why we call her “Khun Lalin,”

00:33:23.542 --> 00:33:25.334
like how we call her dad “Khun Ar.” (Uncle)

00:33:26.292 --> 00:33:28.751
Very detailed. Tuk explained it all.

00:33:29.083 --> 00:33:31.167
Here, take this to Khun Lin.

00:33:33.959 --> 00:33:34.999
Got it.

00:33:55.375 --> 00:33:57.459
Matcha honey lemon for you, P’ Lalin.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:00.334
Thanks.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.584
Welcome, new staff

00:34:05.834 --> 00:34:07.000
Thank you, P’ Laliin.

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.876
I’ll do my best.

00:34:12.292 --> 00:34:15.626
At first, try to observe and learn from your seniors.

00:34:17.876 --> 00:34:18.709
Yes.

00:34:26.167 --> 00:34:27.667
Stop standing there smiling

00:34:28.042 --> 00:34:29.375
get to work already!

00:34:53.667 --> 00:34:55.918
Hello, what would you like to order?

00:34:55.959 --> 00:34:57.999
I'll have a slightly sweet iced cappuccino, please.

00:34:59.125 --> 00:35:00.000
and a slice of strawberry cake, please.

00:35:00.918 --> 00:35:01.792
Alright.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.876
That’ll be 255 baht.

00:35:05.209 --> 00:35:06.042
I’ll scan to pay.

00:35:06.334 --> 00:35:07.250
You can scan right over here.

00:35:13.375 --> 00:35:16.083
Thank you. Please feel free to take a seat at your table.

00:35:22.167 --> 00:35:25.125
Kanit, that customer looks familiar.

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.918
Isn’t she the one who had an issue with me yesterday?

00:35:29.083 --> 00:35:31.334
She left a review about our café yesterday

00:35:31.334 --> 00:35:33.125
and now she’s back again today.

00:35:33.292 --> 00:35:35.042
There’s definitely something off.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.417
Keep an eye on her, okay?

00:35:38.375 --> 00:35:41.250
But let’s make her drink first.

00:35:41.334 --> 00:35:42.751
Wait a while, there will be another issue.

00:35:53.918 --> 00:35:54.459
Excuse me.

00:35:54.918 --> 00:35:55.417
Yes?

00:35:55.834 --> 00:35:57.334
If my drink is ready

00:35:57.334 --> 00:35:58.667
could you bring it over to my table, please?

00:35:59.250 --> 00:35:59.876
Sure.

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:05.751
Is the drink for that table ready yet?

00:36:07.918 --> 00:36:09.542
It’s okay. I can bring it over.

00:36:11.209 --> 00:36:13.334
No worries. I’ve got it.

00:36:27.709 --> 00:36:29.334
Are you new here? I haven’t seen you before.

00:36:30.167 --> 00:36:31.834
Yes, it’s actually my first day.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000
There you go

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.334
customer number two for me.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.417
Are you seriously going to count every
single customer that walks in?

00:36:43.459 --> 00:36:48.334
I’m counting the first 100!
Special customers served by Dalan herself.

00:36:49.626 --> 00:36:53.459
Well, if you want to get to 100 quickly,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.959
how about you serve every customer today, Dalan?

00:36:55.999 --> 00:36:56.751
Tuk!

00:36:57.459 --> 00:36:59.959
Just kidding — I’ll help.

00:37:13.375 --> 00:37:15.334
It's weird.

00:37:15.334 --> 00:37:17.792
She left less than 10 minutes after sitting down.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:21.250
Maybe she have something urgent to do.

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:22.500
That’s why she rush out.

00:37:23.999 --> 00:37:25.375
Still kinda suspicious though.

00:37:30.751 --> 00:37:32.584
Why? What happen with that customer?

00:37:32.626 --> 00:37:35.042
It’s a long story. I’ll tell you later.

00:37:39.959 --> 00:37:42.918
I'm get back to work first, everyone. And please help look after the new staff.

00:37:43.209 --> 00:37:44.542
Got it!

00:37:48.375 --> 00:37:50.292
Are you someone’s special recruit or what?

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:53.999
Maybe I am, Kanit. Just kidding!

00:37:54.292 --> 00:37:55.792
I’m gonna clear the table now.

00:37:56.083 --> 00:37:57.042
I’ll help.

00:38:07.751 --> 00:38:11.209
That hair is so obvious. Didn’t anyone notice it?

00:38:11.834 --> 00:38:14.167
Who’d dare eat that…

00:38:14.709 --> 00:38:16.542
I wouldn’t.

00:38:16.667 --> 00:38:20.083
If it were me, I’d totally freak out.

00:38:28.792 --> 00:38:31.167
Kanit, come check this table.

00:38:43.999 --> 00:38:47.209
That’s not my hair. Mine isn’t even this color.

00:38:48.083 --> 00:38:50.626
I didn’t notice it before I served the cake either.

00:38:52.083 --> 00:38:55.709
That’s weird. I’ve worked here for a year and this has never happened.

00:38:58.209 --> 00:39:00.000
How did a hair end up in the cake?

00:39:20.292 --> 00:39:23.459
Kanit, can you check the CCTV?

00:39:23.542 --> 00:39:24.959
Look at the part when she was sitting here.

00:39:25.375 --> 00:39:26.500
Got it.

00:39:33.959 --> 00:39:37.876
I don’t know what to do.

00:39:38.834 --> 00:39:40.417
Should we go live and apologize?

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:15.709
Whoa. That CCTV footage is solid.

00:40:17.042 --> 00:40:18.834
Jin, Tuk — get the live setup ready.

00:40:19.792 --> 00:40:21.834
Dalan, forget the apology script.

00:40:22.709 --> 00:40:26.083
With proof this clear, they’ll be bowing with a fruit basket for sure.

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:29.209
We only accept cash apologies, thank you.

00:40:31.626 --> 00:40:32.100
Kanit!

00:40:37.709 --> 00:40:38.876
Haven't know you have this character.

00:40:38.876 --> 00:40:40.417
Yeah… never thought I’d see this.

00:40:43.626 --> 00:40:48.042
Hello. I’m the owner of the café that’s currently all over the news.

00:40:48.876 --> 00:40:51.459
I want to address what happened here recently.

00:40:52.417 --> 00:40:54.667
First, about the seating issue.

00:40:54.667 --> 00:40:57.667
Our staff politely asked a customer to move to a smaller table.

00:40:58.083 --> 00:40:59.459
Just want to make it clear

00:40:59.751 --> 00:41:03.542
we had no intention of kicking anyone out.

00:41:03.792 --> 00:41:08.292
It was simply a request to move to a table for two.

00:41:08.792 --> 00:41:11.459
We sincerely apologize for any misunderstanding.

00:41:12.542 --> 00:41:17.209
Now, about the cake and the hair incident.

00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:19.083
The customer posted a review claiming there was hair in the cake,

00:41:19.125 --> 00:41:20.751
which damaged our reputation.

00:41:21.083 --> 00:41:24.918
But we now have CCTV footage showing that

00:41:25.375 --> 00:41:27.000
the customer brought the hair herself

00:41:27.042 --> 00:41:28.834
and intentionally placed it in the cake.

00:41:29.459 --> 00:41:31.334
We’re asking you to delete your post.

00:41:31.667 --> 00:41:33.709
If you do, we won’t press charges.

00:41:33.959 --> 00:41:35.250
But if not

00:41:35.584 --> 00:41:38.167
we’ll pursue legal action to the fullest extent.

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:57.792
Today, I finally understand everything Dad used to say.

00:42:00.959 --> 00:42:03.542
Even with a whole team, I’m exhausted

00:42:05.918 --> 00:42:07.876
I can’t imagine how hard it was for him doing this alone.

00:43:02.125 --> 00:43:04.667
Hey, why are you still here?

00:43:05.375 --> 00:43:07.083
I want to keep you company.

00:43:09.334 --> 00:43:11.584
So, how was your first day at work?

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:13.918
so fun

00:43:14.959 --> 00:43:17.626
Thank you for letting me be part of this.

00:43:29.751 --> 00:43:31.000
Can you teach me?

00:48:17.459 --> 00:48:19.417
And… thank you for going to the police station with me.

00:48:21.083 --> 00:48:23.792
No problem — happy to help.

00:48:26.542 --> 00:48:27.459
Oof!

00:48:27.626 --> 00:48:30.792
What’s wrong? Do you need to use the toilet?

00:48:32.459 --> 00:48:35.959
No, I’m not sick — I’m just hungry.

00:48:37.751 --> 00:48:38.792
What?, Dim

00:48:39.125 --> 00:48:41.834
What’s up with your neck? You’ve got red spots all over.

00:48:43.334 --> 00:48:44.959
on your arm too.

00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:47.584
What happened?

00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:50.709
Whoa, you’re right!

00:48:54.918 --> 00:48:56.417
Probably mosquito bites.

00:48:57.334 --> 00:48:59.709
What were you doing to get that many?
