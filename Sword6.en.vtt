00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.480
Send me that video so I can take a look.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.600
Pause.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.870
What is that woman holding?

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.360
From its size,

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.670
could it be a child?

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.430
Little Spud?

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.870
120 got the distress call at 16:12.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.840
This person came out at 16:13.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.760
They're the closest
to the time of the incident.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.511
We might've missed them
during screening.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.560
How about this?

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.710
Track this person down

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.080
and ask them what happened.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.920
No footage captured their face.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.200
Only their legs.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.840
Wait.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.222
There's someone beside the car.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.600
There really is someone.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.270
Director, you've got sharp eyes.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.600
Sharpen the image.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.040
Where have I seen this?

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.320
Pull up Meng Gui's interrogation video.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.080
Zoom in on his feet.

00:02:43.355 --> 00:02:44.590
During the interrogation,

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.490
he was very fidgety.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:46.450
His feet kept moving.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.360
So I remembered his shoes.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.200
Look at the time he left the park.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.000
Rewind.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.640
There's a three-minute gap.

00:02:55.644 --> 00:02:58.390
The blind spot between these two cameras
is where the child was lost.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.200
They used this window
to transfer the child.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.080
I told you he wasn't telling the truth.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.670
Can we arrest him now?

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.070
Not yet.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.680
We still can't confirm

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.822
whether the bag he was holding
had Little Spud inside.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.666
We can't just bring him in
based on shoes.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.066
We'll need more evidence.

The project won't wait, you know?

00:03:50.622 --> 00:03:52.440
You won't find the child
right away anyway.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.840
You need to let it go.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.880
Mr. Liu, I can't let it go.

What happened?

00:05:22.866 --> 00:05:24.510
Xin wasn't in good health to begin with.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.080
And she's been too stressed lately.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.880
What are you buying to cook for him?

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.440
Let's see
what's on sale at the supermarket.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.800
This kid just loves meat.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.910
Meat is good.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.120
This is the time to eat meat.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.160
It'll help them grow.

Look.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:47.750
Just mentioning food

00:05:47.888 --> 00:05:49.444
makes her so happy.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.640
She hasn't eaten or slept
to find Little Spud.

00:05:58.311 --> 00:05:59.520
She fainted again today,

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.320

so I thought of calling you.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.000
Maybe you can talk some sense into her.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.920
It's alright.

00:06:11.244 --> 00:06:13.111
What did the doctor say
after examining her?

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.240
Nothing serious.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.150
She's just exhausted.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.120
Since the child went missing,

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.080
she put all her energy into this.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.960
She lost her job too.

00:06:23.688 --> 00:06:25.133
Aside from searching for our child,

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.910
she does nothing else.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:29.870

You can't
keep hitting yourself like this!

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:33.830
- Calm down.
- Xin!

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:34.600
Call a doctor!

Calm down first!

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.440
I'll go get a doctor!

Don't scare me.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:43.910
My child is gone.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.000
Our child is missing.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.560
What's the point of living now?

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.640
- Cai Xin!
- Xin!

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.400
Cai Xin.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.160
What's the point of me being alive?

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.640
Cai Xin!

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.000
Trust me one more time.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.150
I'll find Little Spud.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.910
Just trust me one more time, okay?

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:08.870
Trust you?

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.640
You lied to me.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.270
My child isn't coming back.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.600
My child isn't coming back!

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.190
- Xin.
- How am I supposed to live?

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.510
Just let me die!

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:22.470
Xin!

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.120
- If you keep this up,
- Let go of me!

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.470
Little Spud won't have a family
when he comes home.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.390
No matter where he is,

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.590
I'll bring him back.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.390
Trust me, okay?

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.120
Little Spud...

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.910
Little Spud can't be without a family.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.320
He can't be without a family.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.240
Let alone without a mother.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.320
You have to bring him back.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.080
I'll bring him back.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.120
Promise me

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.510
you'll bring him back.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:54.390
I promise you.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.710
I'll definitely bring him back.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.630
You bring him back.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:58.550
Okay.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.640
If you don't bring him back,
our family is no more.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.155
The family will be no more...

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:10.070
Promise me.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.080
I promise you.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.480
I promise you.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.510
He'll come back.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.350
Any updates

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.488
on Luo Xiaoyu's case?

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.310
Lawyer Sun.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:28.230
Xiaoxing.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.880
We're still investigating.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.150
There's no...

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.630
Didn't Director Deng promise

00:08:33.688 --> 00:08:35.222
at Public Complaints Administration

00:08:35.244 --> 00:08:36.550
to help me find my brother?

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:37.750
How long has it been?

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.590
Why is there still no lead?

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.150
Do you police officers

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:42.630
make promises you don't keep?

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:44.830
Officer Ai.

00:08:44.911 --> 00:08:46.444
You were also there that day.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.680
Director Deng made a solemn vow.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.240
Forget it.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:54.310
You're all unreliable.

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:56.390

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.280
had someone draw this sketch.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.080
Please use it to investigate.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.120
No, Lawyer Sun.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.110
What do you mean we're unreliable?

How do you know we haven't been trying?

After Director Deng came back that day,

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:10.840
she had the tech department
sketch a portrait

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.000
based on Luo Xiaoyu's bones.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.840
At the same time,

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.888
we shared this portrait

00:09:14.911 --> 00:09:16.755
with public security departments
at all levels

00:09:16.777 --> 00:09:18.110
to investigate together.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:20.950

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.920
Why didn't you tell me?

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:30.150
Yeah.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.710
If I hadn't brought this out today,

00:09:31.755 --> 00:09:33.355
you wouldn't have shown it to me either.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.600
We did issue a notice for assistance

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.800
based on the new portrait,

00:09:40.888 --> 00:09:43.066
but we haven't received
any useful information.

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:45.120
Without new leads,

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.710
we can't inform the family.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.110
We hope you understand.

you've done so far.

We truly understand how you feel.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:05.080
What we need now
is unity and cooperation

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.488
between the police and the public.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.350

Thank you for today.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:14.790
It's alright.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:15.870
Lin Hao.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.320
I suggest you take her
to see a psychologist.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:19.550
Given her current state,

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.622
it's likely

I'll head over first.

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.190
Sure, go ahead.

Don't upset her again.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:40.870

Fafa's relatives had been found,

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.110
so Fafa waits in the reception room
every day.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.440
Poor child.

Yes.

Are they Mom and Dad?

are gone.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.270
I never thought

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:37.666
I'd be able to find you again.

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.560
Mom and Dad had always looked for you.

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:41.750
While they were looking,

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.320
they got into a car accident.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.320
Grandma also got sick and passed away.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.400
I'm the only one left.

Later,

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.440
they adopted me.

What do you usually like to play?

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:16.520
To be honest,

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.160
our family

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.680
really can't afford
to adopt two children.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:24.830
I'm sorry.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.230
It's okay. I understand.

Sister, don't go.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.630
Sister, you must come to get me.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.070
I will.

00:14:59.466 --> 00:15:01.400
She understands
everything adults say right away.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.750
Her complicated background

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.750
worries the adoptive parents.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.680
We can't lie to adoptive families, right?

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.680
That's completely understandable.

00:15:12.311 --> 00:15:13.550
What I'm most worried about now

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:14.911
is Fafa's mental state.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.440
She was already traumatized.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.990
With what happened today,

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:19.670
I'm afraid

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.750
she might behave abnormally later on.

caught a clear shot of the man's face.

Even the few that did catch him

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:52.670
were too blurry

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:53.590
to be useful.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.800
What about the shoes?

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.030
Did you contact the shoe manufacturer?

Yes, but we haven't found anything.

Sorry about last time.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.360
I didn't see you.

No.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.480
I'm not here because of that.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:57.910

something felt off.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.040
watching the commotion?

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.110
Also,

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.440
today I saw

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.950
the video of the child's mother
trying to jump from the rooftop.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.488
It reminded me of the incident again,

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.480
so I rushed to see Lawyer Sun.

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:49.390
Do you remember
what the woman looked like?

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.000
She was too far away.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.150
I couldn't see clearly.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:56.790
What about the car?

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.590
Did you see what kind of car it was?

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:00.030
It looked like

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.630
a beat-up

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.430
van.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:06.040
Are you sure it was a van?

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.440
If what the woman
Sun Wenhan brought in said is true,

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.430
that a woman carried the child away,

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:12.160
the direction she left in

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.311
matches the direction
of this surveillance footage.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:15.310
This woman

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:17.190
was likely working with Meng Gui.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.480
The timing and direction

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.400
all line up.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.560
It clears up our doubts.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.830
Lawyer Sun is a great help.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.800
We should...

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:28.360
Focus on locating Meng Gui.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.240
Investigate the vans
near the crime scene.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.070
South C 1798B.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:51.190
A Linshan-registered vehicle.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.830
According to surveillance footage,
this van shows up daily

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:55.800
near the Qingluo Town wholesale market.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:30.750
Move!

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:31.670
What are you doing?

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.990
Watch it!

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.360
What's going on?

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:09.510
Get up.

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.420
(Interrogation Room)

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.360
What's your name?

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:14.510
Wang...

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:15.430
Wang Laoshi.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.560
Why did you run when you saw us?

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:21.480
I...

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.280
I thought you were debt collectors.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.000
I took out a loan from loan sharks
and couldn't pay it back.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:26.790
They...

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:27.844
They harass me every day.

00:22:27.888 --> 00:22:29.350
I couldn't take it.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:31.880
If I knew you were the police,

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.480
I wouldn't have run.

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:34.870
Now that I think about it,

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.430
being at the police station
feels much safer.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.270
Look,

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:39.190
officers.

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:40.720
You've got to...

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:41.920
You've got to protect me.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:42.790
Officers.

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:43.720
Do you know Meng Gui?

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:45.510
Who?

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.310
Meng...

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:47.230
Meng Gui?

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:50.710
No.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.830
Is this white van yours?

00:22:58.550 --> 00:22:59.480
Yes.

00:22:59.933 --> 00:23:01.560
Have you ever lent this van to anyone?

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:03.870
No way.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.120
Every morning,

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:07.350
I drive it to Nankou Seafood Market

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:08.240
to make deliveries.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.560
I've been driving it every day
since I bought it.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:13.390
There's no way I lent it to others.

00:23:18.244 --> 00:23:20.244
There are two vans
with this license plate.

00:23:22.666 --> 00:23:24.320
That means one of them
is a cloned plate.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.760
I suspect that's the vehicle
they use to transport children.

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:29.670
Any leads on the other van?

00:23:30.511 --> 00:23:32.550
That vehicle appeared
during the same timeframe

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:33.910
in both Linshan and Lingnan.

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:42.670
It's Meng Gui.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.040
So he has a cloned vehicle.

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:46.960
That matches the shoe lead as well.

00:23:48.311 --> 00:23:50.150
We confirmed with Dahai
from the supermarket.

00:23:50.288 --> 00:23:51.510
Wang Laoshi was being honest.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:52.430
He told the truth.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.000
This guy's really unlucky.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.933
He didn't even know
his plate had been cloned.

00:23:58.177 --> 00:24:00.080
I've notified
the Economic Investigation unit.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.550
Maybe they can help him

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:02.644
with the loan shark issue.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:04.840
He's pretty impressive.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.480
Driving a cloned van

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:08.240
with not a single violation.

00:24:09.355 --> 00:24:11.177
I think he has multiple license plates.

00:24:11.444 --> 00:24:13.422
He switches them
every time he gets a ticket.

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:14.750
He's cautious.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.590
Where is that van now?

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.400
It was last seen at 8 PM last night

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.720
at Lingnan's Youyi Mall.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:28.870
Then it disappeared.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:29.920
Before that,

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.910
its movements were also irregular.

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.990
Look.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.510
Yesterday it was in Lingnan,

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:35.600
the day before in Linjiang,

00:24:35.644 --> 00:24:36.910
and before that in Hongxi.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.680
In just one month,

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.830
it's been to so many places.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.777
Even some counties
in neighboring provinces.

00:24:41.777 --> 00:24:42.911
He never repeats a place.

00:24:46.688 --> 00:24:48.910
If this is really the vehicle
they use to move children,

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.590
he'll avoid highways.

00:24:51.311 --> 00:24:52.560
That makes it hard to track.

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:55.190
So we'll need to expand
the search radius.

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:56.760
I also believe

00:24:57.222 --> 00:24:59.400
Meng Gui and his people
are likely a criminal ring.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.350
They won't act alone.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.480
As long as we find Meng Gui
and follow his trail,

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.670
we can take down
the entire criminal organization.

00:25:04.777 --> 00:25:06.430
I agree with Director Deng's analysis.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.311
According to our earlier assumptions,

00:25:08.377 --> 00:25:09.510
if this criminal gang

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:11.480
is connected to a girl trafficking ring,

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.880
we'll find that criminal group

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.590
once we crack this lead.

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:24.190
Lawyer Sun.

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:27.320
What's with the lead you mentioned
yesterday?

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.560
A former coworker told me

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:30.110
someone in their village

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:31.390
had a child last year,

00:25:31.644 --> 00:25:33.390
but the child disappeared
within a few days.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.270
Recently, he went back

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:37.280
and attended
that child's first birthday party.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.320
I thought it was very strange.

00:25:39.577 --> 00:25:41.870
Do you think this could be related
to Little Spud's case?

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:46.480
Tell me his name.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.400
Where does he live?

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.440
Hello?

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.560
Dacheng. Are you
still in Xibang Village, Shanyang?

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:52.880
I go back occasionally.

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:53.720
Why?

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.155
Wait there. I'm coming to find you.

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:01.940
(July 10, 2009, Xibang Village,
Jinglong Town, Shanyang County)

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.550
Our villagers are close-knit.

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:27.870
Be careful in there.

00:26:29.777 --> 00:26:30.840
Bring all the documents.

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:47.270
Over there.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:04.560
That house next door.

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:05.990
Let's go.

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:08.270
I'm not going with you.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.990
Careful.

00:27:34.488 --> 00:27:36.370
(Xibang Village, Jinglong Town)
Drink a little more, okay?

00:27:36.377 --> 00:27:37.222
Good boy.

00:27:37.266 --> 00:27:38.222
Just a sip.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.560
Okay?

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:41.440
Here.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.720
One more tiny sip, okay?

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:46.320
Who is it?

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.040
Hello, Madam.

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:53.000
May I ask something?

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:55.280
Does Fan Dacheng live in this village?

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:56.910
You mean Fan Laosan?

00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:58.430
He lives here.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.840
Who are you?

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.630
I'm his friend.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:03.590
His friend?

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:05.000
You don't know where he lives?

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:07.680
I'm a lawyer.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:08.960
We met in the city.

00:28:09.022 --> 00:28:10.533
He said he was from Xibang Village.

00:28:10.555 --> 00:28:11.750
I've never been here before.

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.000
I happened to pass by today,
so I thought I'd visit him.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.400
He's not home.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.670
He went out to work a while ago.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.150
Are his parents at home?

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:23.280
I'd like to visit them.

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:24.960
His parents are around.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:25.880
I'll show you.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
Go down this path by our house.

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:29.230
Go straight.

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:31.110
At the first intersection,

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:33.044
turn right.
It's the third house on the right.

00:28:33.088 --> 00:28:33.830
Got it, thanks.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.190
He's so cute.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:39.320
He seems to be sick.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.680
His face is a bit pale.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:41.920
He overates these days

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:42.840
and has indigestion.

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:45.400
Right?

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.250
That's why
he refused to drink milk earlier...

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.400
What are you doing?

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:51.790
What are you doing?

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:52.480
I...

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.430
I'm examining him.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.280
Are you a doctor?

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.320
Who is this?

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:02.310
Hello.

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:04.350
He insisted
on taking a photo of the child.

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.520
First, he said he was a lawyer,
then a doctor.

00:29:07.111 --> 00:29:08.819
I just found your child cute.

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.349
Why are you taking pictures of my child?

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:11.750
He looks unwell. He's really cute.

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:12.310
Delete it.

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:13.270
I...

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:14.270
Delete it now.

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:15.190
Okay.

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:16.940
(Delete)

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.340
(Save)

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.880
I deleted it.

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.350
I just found your child cute

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:22.350
and took a photo of him.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.310
Look.

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:24.430
Don't misunderstand.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.110
I'll go find

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:26.830
Fan Dacheng.

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:27.750
Thank you.

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:42.400
What's going on?

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:44.720
He's here for Fan Laosan.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.350
Then he said the child didn't look right

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:48.270
and took a photo.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.510
First, he said he's a lawyer,

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:52.430
then a doctor.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:55.800
Could he be a child trafficker?

00:29:59.933 --> 00:30:01.350
Keep the door locked from now on.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.577
Watch out for strangers.

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:27.380
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.320
I found it.

00:30:30.488 --> 00:30:32.888
That vehicle with the fake license plate
has appeared.

00:30:36.533 --> 00:30:38.711
Where else
has this vehicle been spotted?

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.310
Lingnan, Jijiang,

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:41.680
Changqing, and Hongxi.

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:44.288
The last place it appeared
was Jiuguan County in Hongxi City.

00:30:46.444 --> 00:30:49.444
Which means no matter where it goes,
it always passes through Linshan.

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:51.920
Linshan is its base of operations.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.840
Yes.

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:55.320
If they're really hiding in Linshan

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.280
and managed to evade our earlier sweeps,

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.800
they must be cautious.

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:02.030
So that means

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:03.080
finding this vehicle

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:05.000
might give us clues about Little Spud.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.480
Check this vehicle's movements
in Linshan.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:14.400
Okay.

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:22.440
This vehicle is cunning.

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.070
It avoided most of the traffic cameras

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.990
in Linshan.

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:26.160
All this time,

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.150
only four cameras have captured it.

00:31:28.577 --> 00:31:30.830
The intersection
of Renmin Road and Xiangyun Street,

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:33.000
Renmin Road and Nansheng Street,

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:35.310
Hongshan Road and Xiangyun Street,

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:37.169
and Hongshan Road and Nansheng Street.

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:39.000
(Renmin Road, Nansheng Street,
Xiangyun Street, Hongshan Road)

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:40.000
So that means

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.190
these four intersections
are on its regular route.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:43.550
And there must be

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:45.280
a fixed parking spot for it here.

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:47.270
That's a huge area.

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:47.920
How about we ask

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:50.250
the local police station
and neighborhood patrols for help?

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:51.190
Absolutely not.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.350
These people are alert.

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:53.920
If we ask them for help,

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.280
they'll likely be spooked.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
How about this?

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.222
The four of us
will each watch one intersection.

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.830
Well...

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:04.480
It was just spotted in Jijiang today.

00:32:04.511 --> 00:32:05.929
It hasn't returned to Linshan yet.

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:07.750
Isn't it too early for us
to start watching it?

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:09.480
No. Look at the pattern.

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:11.320
It returns to Linshan every three days.

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:13.110
(Intersection)
It's been three days.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.240
It's almost

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.160
time.

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:19.640
How about this?

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.640
Mr. Yin.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.111
You'll watch the Renmin Road
and Nansheng Road's intersection.

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:28.350
Chang Rui

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:30.888
will watch Nansheng Street
and Hongshan Road's intersection.

00:32:30.911 --> 00:32:32.780
(Hongshan Road)

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:35.950
Jiajia...

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:40.320
But Jiajia needs to
monitor the surveillance network.

00:32:40.466 --> 00:32:42.933
It's fine. I'll get a colleague
from traffic control to help.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:44.200
You sure?

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.120
Yes.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.070
(Xiangyun Street)

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.880
Alright.

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.400
Watch the Renmin Road
and Nansheng Road's intersection then.

00:32:49.444 --> 00:32:51.577
And get the traffic control team
to coordinate.

00:32:51.622 --> 00:32:52.230
No problem.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.200
I'll take care of Xiangyun Street

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.066
(Renmin Road)
and Renmin Road's intersection.

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:08.300
(Tianxia Shuiyi)

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:35.990
Enough.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:41.800
Buddies.

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:43.400
Today, a stranger

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.520
came into our village.

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:45.710
Did anyone see him?

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.160
I didn't notice.

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:54.030
You three elders

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:54.950
usually have free time.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.360
Keep an eye out for me.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.640
- Alright.
- Alright.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.440
That guy

00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.560
might be a child trafficker.

00:34:00.488 --> 00:34:01.533
Sure.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.880
Rui, any updates on your end?

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:55.880
Nothing for now.

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:56.990
What about you guys?

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.320
Nothing here either.

00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:00.310
Have they not returned to Linshan yet?

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:02.880
He will come back.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.400
He avoided so many cameras,

00:35:04.733 --> 00:35:06.000
but they can't avoid this spot.

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:06.670
That means

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:08.040
this is a route they must take.

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:12.070
Copy.

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:13.550
Stay alert.

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:15.080
He could show up anytime.

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:32.230
Whose clothes are these?

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:34.760
Whose clothes?

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.440
I'm hanging them out to dry, okay?

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:39.920
Let's go.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.400
We...

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:08.960
Once I finish hanging the laundry,
we'll go to bed.

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:10.030
Don't cry.

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:10.960
Good boy.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.590
Why are you here again?

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:15.960
Don't misunderstand.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:16.880
Zheng!

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:18.040
Zheng!

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.110
Zheng, the child trafficker is back!

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:21.770
- Don't misunderstand.
- It's you again!

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:22.440
No.

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.000
Guys, he's trying to steal the kid!

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:24.920
Don't misunderstand!

00:36:25.266 --> 00:36:26.630
- Don't run!
- There he is!

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:27.760
Guys, catch the trafficker!

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:28.840
Don't cry.

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:30.880
Don't cry.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:31.800
Stop right there!

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:34.630
Stop!

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.030
Catch the child trafficker!

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.040
Don't let him get away!

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.400
Get him!

00:36:41.866 --> 00:36:43.110
Quick, catch the trafficker.

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:44.000
After him!

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:44.440
Don't run!

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.360
Do you hear me?

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:46.280
Quick!

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.750
- After him!
- Don't run!

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.590
Stop! Don't run!

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:50.520
- Stop!
- Quick!

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:51.720
Don't run!

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:52.840
Child trafficker!

00:36:53.288 --> 00:36:54.150
Child trafficker!

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:55.110
Stop running!

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:56.030
Stop!

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:57.440
There he is!

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.440
Don't run!

00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:58.840
Quick!

00:36:58.840 --> 00:36:59.800
Stop right there!

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:00.440
Stop!

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.110
He's over there!

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:01.760
Stop!

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:02.680
Hurry!

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:03.960
Don't run!

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.720
- Don't let him escape!
- Stop!

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:06.880
Stop!

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:08.510
Stop running! Stop!

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:10.590
Get down!

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:12.880
Open the door!

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:14.960
Don't let him escape!

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:20.080
Open the door! Get out!

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:21.510
Stop him!

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:24.790
Stop him!

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:31.070
Stop him!

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:33.590
Get down!

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.320
Get down!

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.230
Open the door!

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.840
Get out!

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:37.377
Open the door!

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.600
Let's see where you run now!

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:39.630
I said! Get down!

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.110
Get down!

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:42.920
Calling for help?

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:52.800
Hello? Chang Rui.

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:55.040
A car just went from east to west.

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:56.230
It's similar to our target.

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.320
Keep an eye out.

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.750
Get down! Calling for help?

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:00.000
Get him out of the car!

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:00.920
Smash it!

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.190
Get out!

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:13.230
Come out.

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:15.150
Hurry!

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:16.990
Hurry!

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:18.800
Get out.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.320
What are you doing?

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:21.550
Stop!

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:22.110
Move!

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:23.030
Move aside!

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:24.920
Back off.

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:25.840
What are you all doing?

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:27.110
Zheng Mingguang.

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:27.880
What are you doing?

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.555
This is called inciting a disturbance!

00:38:29.577 --> 00:38:30.230
Debang.

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:31.360
He's a child trafficker.

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:34.040
He was sneaking around
taking photos outside my house.

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.840
He wants to steal my child!

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:36.760
Get out.

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:38.030
Get out!

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.555
Go to the village committee
and explain everything.

00:38:40.866 --> 00:38:42.977
Come on.
Come with us to make a statement.

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:45.540
(Call Ended)

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:51.320
But there are lots of vans like this.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.520
They all look similar.

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:54.520
Standard ones have dark window tint.

00:38:54.577 --> 00:38:56.070
But pay attention to its appearance.

00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:57.960
There's a very noticeable dent on it.

00:38:58.480 --> 00:38:59.400
Got it.

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:01.820
(Tianxia Shuiyi)

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:09.760
Meng.

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:10.680
Go.

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:12.070
I'm exhausted.

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:13.222
My back hurts from driving.

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:14.790
Alright, drive slowly.

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:16.510
You worked hard, Meng.

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:17.720
Let's go.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.000
All units, attention.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:20.920
Meng Gui has appeared.

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:21.840
Where is he?

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:23.510
At Tianxia Shuiyi Bathing Center.

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:24.560
Meng Gui has gone inside.

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:47.080
The target vehicle is on the move.

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.620
(Tianxia Shuiyi)

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.310
Chang Rui, arrest Meng Gui.

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:01.470
The rest, follow me.

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:05.620
(Tianxia Shuiyi)

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.280
I'm here.

00:40:32.644 --> 00:40:33.688
All units, attention.

00:40:33.711 --> 00:40:34.480
The target vehicle

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.580
has entered Hongtoushan
Residential Area's parking lot.

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:37.400
Requesting backup.

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:48.150
Sir, are you alone?

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:51.750
Is this your only exit?

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:53.800
Inside, please.

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.320
All units, attention.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.150
Target vehicle C1798B has appeared.

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:35.333
Close in on my location now.

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:49.110
What did you do?

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:50.030
You're so dirty

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.750
that you're in a rush to shower.

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:55.800
Officer Chang.

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.240
Come here.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.240
