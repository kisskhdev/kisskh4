00:10.427 --> 00:12.429
[fraught, suspenseful music playing]

00:15.890 --> 00:17.851
[Enid] Wednesday, hurry!

00:17.934 --> 00:19.519
This is all your fault.

00:20.186 --> 00:21.021
[echoing] Wednesday…

00:21.104 --> 00:22.147
[murder cawing]

00:22.230 --> 00:23.648
Wednesday…

00:23.732 --> 00:25.692
I died because of you!

00:25.775 --> 00:27.694
-[music fades]
-Enid!

00:28.194 --> 00:29.863
[Morticia] Enid's fine, dear.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.115
It's you I'm worried about.

00:34.576 --> 00:35.410
Mother.

00:35.493 --> 00:39.664
When it comes to your ability,
I asked you to be honest with me.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.791
I know what those tears mean.

00:42.375 --> 00:44.252
It's psychic exhaustion.

00:44.335 --> 00:47.297
That's what happens
when you abuse your gift.

00:47.380 --> 00:48.590
I've harnessed it.

00:48.673 --> 00:50.967
[scoffs] You sound just like your aunt.

00:52.218 --> 00:53.928
How do I get the tears to go away?

00:54.596 --> 00:58.224
Well… you can start
by giving me Goody's book of spells.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.644
Don't be upset with him.
He was worried sick.

01:03.313 --> 01:04.355
As was I.

01:06.441 --> 01:09.402
Goody was my spirit guide.
That book belongs to me.

01:09.986 --> 01:12.072
This isn't something you can control.

01:12.155 --> 01:14.991
You have to be patient
and wait for your new guide.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.910
They will appear when the time is right.

01:16.993 --> 01:18.453
I don't have that time.

01:19.496 --> 01:20.747
Not after tonight.

01:21.581 --> 01:24.501
You never believe the rules apply to you.

01:24.584 --> 01:26.711
And I applaud that.

01:26.795 --> 01:29.422
But you cannot bend
your psychic ability to your will.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.299
And you can't expect me to bend to yours.

01:32.133 --> 01:35.804
You cannot tell me to blaze my own trail
and then put up these roadblocks.

01:35.887 --> 01:37.305
I am not your enemy.

01:37.388 --> 01:38.264
I am your mother.

01:38.848 --> 01:41.476
Your ability is not
a weapon to be deployed.

01:41.559 --> 01:43.520
It's a gift to be respected.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.356
I liked you better a crystal ball away.

01:48.024 --> 01:50.276
Well, one day I won't be here anymore.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.404
And you can recklessly
live your life as you see fit.

01:58.284 --> 02:01.287
You were supposed to help me protect her.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.082
Most of all, from herself.

02:06.543 --> 02:08.545
[ominous music playing]

02:12.298 --> 02:14.926
[Wednesday]
Galpin's warning, Xavier's painting,

02:16.177 --> 02:18.304
and my vision of Enid's death…

02:19.931 --> 02:23.268
they all have a certain one-eyed,
black-winged bird in common.

02:25.770 --> 02:26.771
Lurch?

02:27.689 --> 02:29.107
We need to make a stop.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.152
[Lurch growls]

02:40.577 --> 02:42.579
[eerie, mysterious music playing]

03:01.181 --> 03:02.182
[Wednesday] Galpin!

03:15.028 --> 03:18.323
How can it be breaking and entering
if everything is already broken?

03:21.701 --> 03:22.744
Galpin?

03:23.369 --> 03:26.206
I know you're lurking somewhere
in this suburban squalor.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.464
I don't have time
for your drunken stupors.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.174
I need you to tell me about your case.

03:36.257 --> 03:37.550
[jarring stinger]

03:52.523 --> 03:53.733
[cawing]

04:16.923 --> 04:17.924
[caws]

04:19.092 --> 04:20.093
[caws]

04:28.434 --> 04:30.353
Murdered by a murder of crows.

04:31.980 --> 04:35.733
What a perfectly ironic death
wasted on the least ironic man I ever met.

04:35.817 --> 04:40.029
Let's see if he can finally offer
some useful investigative insight.

04:41.239 --> 04:42.824
It's my only clue to saving Enid.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.704
[staticky audio distortions]

04:50.581 --> 04:52.041
I'm not seeing anything.

04:54.836 --> 04:57.797
[staticky audio distortions continue]

05:01.050 --> 05:02.176
My ability.

05:03.511 --> 05:05.513
-It's not working.
-[sirens wailing]

05:08.725 --> 05:11.144
[agitated chatter outside]

05:11.978 --> 05:12.812
Freeze!

05:14.480 --> 05:16.691
Wednesday Addams, you're under arrest.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.986
[jauntily macabre music playing]

05:28.745 --> 05:31.748
-What were you doing at Galpin's house?
-He asked me to stop by.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.124
In the middle of the night?

05:33.207 --> 05:34.959
What were you doing there, Sheriff?

05:37.045 --> 05:40.465
Turns out, the last person
to have his eyes pecked out

05:40.548 --> 05:42.675
called Galpin right before he died.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.344
You remember him?

05:44.427 --> 05:45.678
Carl Bradbury?

05:45.762 --> 05:49.307
I wanted to know what they had discussed,
but Galpin wasn't answering his cell.

05:49.390 --> 05:52.018
A phone that has since vanished.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.937
There was no trace
when we searched Galpin's house.

05:55.938 --> 05:57.940
You wouldn't know anything about that?

05:58.024 --> 06:01.569
[Wednesday] I didn't take his phone.
And why are you questioning me?

06:01.652 --> 06:05.198
Galpin's son, Tyler,
is a psychopath who hates his father.

06:05.948 --> 06:08.284
Who's to say he didn't orchestrate this?

06:09.035 --> 06:11.662
Tyler's safely locked away at Willow Hill.

06:11.746 --> 06:13.873
And you were at both crime scenes.

06:13.956 --> 06:15.875
What aren't you telling me, Ms. Addams?

06:15.958 --> 06:17.210
Volumes, no doubt.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.588
You could dangle her
over a pit of rattlesnakes,

06:20.671 --> 06:22.965
and she still wouldn't
tell you her secrets.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.468
-[rattlesnakes buzz]
-Trust me, I've tried.

06:26.010 --> 06:28.930
I'm allowed to question your daughter,
Mr. Addams.

06:29.013 --> 06:31.140
You can sit back there, quietly.

06:32.141 --> 06:33.559
I'm also her lawyer.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.688
And I don't do anything quietly.

06:37.772 --> 06:41.109
If you wish to speak to my client again,
you'll need a court order.

06:41.192 --> 06:43.194
[sprightly, whimsical music playing]

06:45.405 --> 06:46.531
[whispers] Have a good night.

06:51.744 --> 06:54.872
I was fixing my nightcap
when Lurch burst in.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.916
Almost choked on my olive.

06:56.999 --> 06:59.001
I've never seen the old boy so agitated.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.586
[Lurch growls]

07:00.670 --> 07:01.754
And Mother?

07:03.214 --> 07:05.425
Hmm. This stays between us.

07:06.926 --> 07:08.553
To Galpin.

07:09.637 --> 07:10.972
[Gomez smacks lips, sighs]

07:13.516 --> 07:14.976
Why were you at his house?

07:15.560 --> 07:17.770
Are you asking as my lawyer
or as my father?

07:17.854 --> 07:22.525
I can recognize when a fellow card player
is keeping some aces up their sleeve.

07:22.608 --> 07:23.693
I respect that.

07:23.776 --> 07:26.320
But bluffing only gets you so far.

07:28.072 --> 07:29.615
I saw Galpin yesterday.

07:30.199 --> 07:32.493
He was working on a case,
asked for my help.

07:32.577 --> 07:35.204
You get your reckless curiosity from me.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.373
That's why your mother's
so worried about you.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.959
You need to pack her trunks
and take her back home.

07:40.042 --> 07:41.961
I'm afraid her mind is made up.

07:42.044 --> 07:43.337
She's staying.

07:43.421 --> 07:44.464
Trust me.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.757
That casket is closed.

07:52.054 --> 07:53.764
What happened to Aunt Ophelia?

07:58.394 --> 08:00.062
That, my little poison pen…

08:01.731 --> 08:03.691
is not my story to tell.

08:12.950 --> 08:13.951
[music trails off]

08:20.583 --> 08:22.752
You weren't there
at lights out last night.

08:22.835 --> 08:25.213
Don't worry, I didn't tell Ajax.

08:25.796 --> 08:27.715
What were you doing in the Hummers Shed?

08:27.798 --> 08:30.593
Tell me you weren't
eating my bees like your creepy uncle.

08:31.886 --> 08:35.890
I know you and I aren't exactly friends,
but can you keep a secret?

08:37.350 --> 08:40.603
I swear, if even one of my bees
is missing, I'm telling Wedn…

08:40.686 --> 08:42.188
[chains rattling]

08:47.693 --> 08:49.070
Down, boy!

08:50.821 --> 08:51.739
[inhaler puffs]

08:51.822 --> 08:52.823
[gasps]

08:54.492 --> 08:55.868
What is that?

08:55.952 --> 08:57.620
The coolest thing ever!

08:58.204 --> 09:00.039
Now we have a pet and a best friend!

09:00.122 --> 09:02.166
Watch this. It gets cooler.

09:04.001 --> 09:06.837
Remember that story
Ajax told us the first night here?

09:06.921 --> 09:08.256
It's all true.

09:09.340 --> 09:13.427
I jump-started his clockwork heart
and brought him back to life.

09:13.928 --> 09:16.514
This really is
the boy from the Skull Tree.

09:16.597 --> 09:18.140
He's not an urban legend.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.392
He was one of us.

09:19.475 --> 09:22.353
Which is why we should
keep him locked up in here forever.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.690
I don't think that's a very safe idea.

09:26.357 --> 09:28.359
Or a sanitary one.

09:28.859 --> 09:30.528
We need to tell someone before he eats us.

09:30.611 --> 09:31.445
He won't.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.948
Besides, he's got no brain.

09:34.031 --> 09:35.825
Which means he's as harmless as a slug.

09:35.908 --> 09:36.742
[snarls]

09:36.826 --> 09:38.160
[Eugene yelps]

09:38.244 --> 09:39.704
He is hungry, though.

09:39.787 --> 09:41.247
What about honey?

09:41.330 --> 09:42.873
It's nature's perfect food.

09:42.957 --> 09:46.836
Uh, antioxidant, antibacterial,
low glycemic index.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.055
See? He likes it.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.308
[raspy gurgling]

10:03.477 --> 10:04.687
[Eugene spits]

10:06.272 --> 10:08.107
I think I'm going to call him Slurp.

10:13.654 --> 10:16.616
I don't know what's been happening
with my psychic ability lately.

10:16.699 --> 10:18.743
There must be an answer in Goody's book.

10:21.954 --> 10:25.416
In my last vision,
Enid dies and it's all my fault.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.877
Somehow it's connected to those birds.

10:29.503 --> 10:31.380
No one else can know about this.

10:31.464 --> 10:35.343
Especially Enid. She's far too fragile
to face her own impending doom.

10:41.015 --> 10:42.808
[chilling music intensifying]

10:46.437 --> 10:47.438
Enid?

10:50.775 --> 10:51.776
Enid!

10:58.074 --> 10:59.700
Thing, get help!

11:00.201 --> 11:01.535
[restrained snickering]

11:01.619 --> 11:03.120
[content giggling]

11:04.038 --> 11:05.122
[self-satisfied sigh]

11:07.333 --> 11:08.209
Mmm.

11:08.793 --> 11:10.670
Blood and orange jam. My favorite.

11:11.796 --> 11:14.382
Got ya! Happy Prank Day!

11:14.465 --> 11:15.800
[tersely] Prank Day?

11:15.883 --> 11:17.551
It's an annual Nevermore tradition.

11:17.635 --> 11:20.471
You hadn't arrived last year
when we did it. [sighs]

11:20.554 --> 11:23.015
The look on your face
when you thought I was dead,

11:23.099 --> 11:24.225
that was priceless.

11:24.308 --> 11:26.477
I'll carry that memory to my grave.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.604
You might end up there
sooner than you think.

11:29.188 --> 11:32.108
I was just getting you back
for that fake eyeball on my pillow.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.734
What fake eyeball?

11:33.818 --> 11:36.570
[grim, foreboding music playing]

11:38.739 --> 11:42.284
I'd recognize this judgmental,
beady blue-eye stare anywhere.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.621
Ugh, it's so real looking.

11:46.747 --> 11:47.790
Where'd you get it?

11:49.041 --> 11:51.085
A little birdie must have dropped it off.

11:51.585 --> 11:54.797
Are we going to talk about
what happened last night at the pyre?

11:55.297 --> 11:58.217
You freaked me out
with the fainting spell and black tears.

11:58.801 --> 11:59.802
I'm fine.

11:59.885 --> 12:02.471
If you were, Lurch wouldn't
have had to carry you out of there.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.557
For someone who hates
being the center of attention,

12:04.640 --> 12:06.809
you have a weird habit of attracting it.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.602
I'd rather attract leprosy.

12:09.478 --> 12:12.815
I know that being popular goes against
everything Wednesday-core,

12:12.898 --> 12:15.484
but for the rest of us
who also helped save the school,

12:15.568 --> 12:17.111
it is a nice silver lining.

12:17.194 --> 12:18.696
Then consider me your dark cloud.

12:19.530 --> 12:22.700
-Always.
-[phone chimes persistently]

12:30.082 --> 12:33.919
Um, I think your stalker's back,
and they somehow have my cell number.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.173
Call that number back.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.303
[line ringing]

12:42.386 --> 12:45.139
[Galpin] Hey, it's Donovan Galpin.
Leave it at the beep.

12:45.681 --> 12:48.100
Why is Galpin stalking you on my phone?

12:48.184 --> 12:49.643
And why were you at his house?

12:49.727 --> 12:51.437
This isn't Galpin. He was murdered.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.314
-This must be his killer.
-What?

12:53.397 --> 12:54.774
Are you pranking me now?

12:56.442 --> 12:59.779
[pants] I cannot believe
it's only day two of the school year,

12:59.862 --> 13:02.490
and you already involved yourself
in some grisly murder case.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.033
Maybe you're cursed.

13:04.116 --> 13:07.536
I feel really bad about Galpin,
but I didn't even know him that well.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.331
If you could leave me out of this,
that would be great.

13:10.414 --> 13:11.832
This is my fun and freedom era.

13:11.916 --> 13:14.210
I've sworn off
all dead bodies this semester.

13:14.794 --> 13:18.506
This is why you should stay in the dorm
with Thing until I figure this out.

13:19.006 --> 13:23.093
You're the one being stalked by a killer.
I have sharp teeth and claws, remember?

13:23.177 --> 13:25.805
Also, I have my first
driver's ed lesson this afternoon.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.515
You're learning to drive?

13:27.598 --> 13:29.475
Not all of us have chauffeurs.

[music intensifies]

13:43.697 --> 13:45.115
[music trails off]

13:46.158 --> 13:48.369
Stay here. Study Goody's book.

13:48.452 --> 13:50.454
Look for anything
about regaining abilities.

27:29.731 --> 27:32.317
who Tyler gutted
like a freshly caught trout,

27:32.400 --> 27:33.610
I need closure.

27:34.653 --> 27:37.113
I granted your request
with the court weeks ago,

27:37.197 --> 27:39.658
so I knew you'd
show your face sooner or later.

27:40.450 --> 27:43.995
I'm guessing you chose today
because of Donovan Galpin's murder.

27:45.372 --> 27:46.873
Has Tyler heard the news?

27:47.791 --> 27:52.170
Tyler has proven to be a particularly
manipulative and uncooperative patient.

27:52.837 --> 27:54.673
Of course,
I've never dealt with a Hyde before,

27:54.756 --> 27:56.758
so this is uncharted territory.

27:56.841 --> 27:58.385
What about Marilyn Thornhill?

27:58.468 --> 28:01.096
She still denies
that she's Tyler's master.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.890
She's being held in a different facility.

28:03.973 --> 28:06.976
I'm working off the theory
that the longer they're separated,

28:07.060 --> 28:08.937
the weaker their bond becomes.

28:09.020 --> 28:12.607
Then I surmise you and I are speaking
because you need my help.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.944
My traditional care methods
aren't yielding results,

28:16.027 --> 28:17.821
so I think it's time to be…

28:18.321 --> 28:19.698
unorthodox.

28:19.781 --> 28:21.282
Well, you know what they say.

28:21.908 --> 28:25.328
If you can't kill them with kindness,
try lethal injection.

28:26.246 --> 28:27.247
This way.

28:39.175 --> 28:42.303
You could be
the psychological shock Tyler needs

28:42.387 --> 28:44.389
to initiate his rehabilitation.

28:45.098 --> 28:48.768
If the sight of me brings him
any modicum of pain, count me in.

28:51.396 --> 28:52.981
[keypad beeping]

29:01.030 --> 29:02.907
Now, you'll be perfectly safe,

29:02.991 --> 29:06.202
but if you feel threatened
or uncomfortable in any way,

29:06.286 --> 29:07.871
push the red button on the wall.

29:07.954 --> 29:10.373
I'll be watching everything
on the monitor.

29:11.207 --> 29:12.792
Keep a close watch, please.

29:46.701 --> 29:50.288
So, what do you think of the place?

29:54.959 --> 29:58.797
It was originally designed
for a schizophrenic werewolf,

29:58.880 --> 30:02.884
who went on a full-moon killing spree
in the summer of '92.

30:02.967 --> 30:05.303
Ironic, considering
you were thrashed by a werewolf.

30:06.971 --> 30:10.558
It was inevitable your morbid curiosity
would bring you here.

30:11.267 --> 30:13.853
I knew you couldn't resist
seeing me again.

30:13.937 --> 30:17.106
Is that the deluded lie
you've been telling yourself in solitude?

30:17.190 --> 30:20.026
The only person lying
to themselves is you, Wednesday.

30:20.902 --> 30:22.862
You sensed the monster in me.

30:22.946 --> 30:25.073
You fell in love with it.

30:26.699 --> 30:30.745
We're two black-hearted souls
ready to pillage the world together.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.456
The only thing you're pillaging
is an extra fruit cup at dinner.

30:33.540 --> 30:36.960
You act like you're the smartest person
in the room, but you're not.

30:38.753 --> 30:40.797
How come I ended up
on this side of the bars?

30:40.880 --> 30:42.006
Because you got lucky.

30:42.090 --> 30:43.716
-[trills]
-[electricity crackles]

30:52.809 --> 30:54.018
Your father is dead.

30:56.521 --> 30:58.189
He was murdered last night.

30:59.691 --> 31:00.692
[chuckles wryly]

31:03.236 --> 31:04.696
How was he killed?

31:04.779 --> 31:06.072
[Wednesday] Gruesomely.

31:06.573 --> 31:08.658
Another victim died the same way.

31:08.741 --> 31:11.202
Your father's old partner. Carl Bradbury.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.788
Two murders in two days.

31:15.081 --> 31:16.875
Both connected to your family.

31:18.543 --> 31:20.336
You got me, Wednesday.

31:20.920 --> 31:24.340
I'm a criminal mastermind
pulling the strings from in here.

31:24.424 --> 31:25.884
Who else would want him dead?

31:27.510 --> 31:29.220
You're looking for my help?

31:30.221 --> 31:33.516
I'm flattered, but…
it's going to be so much more fun

31:33.600 --> 31:35.768
watching you grope around in the dark.

31:39.063 --> 31:40.565
Say hi to Enid for me.

31:42.734 --> 31:45.153
Tell her I'm gonna kill her
the next time I see her.

31:45.945 --> 31:49.032
Make her pay for sticking
her snout in my business.

31:49.574 --> 31:53.369
I want her screams to haunt you
for the rest of your life.

31:54.954 --> 31:56.247
[Wednesday] You're right.

31:59.167 --> 32:00.752
I couldn't resist seeing you.

32:01.794 --> 32:05.340
Witnessing you chained and caged up
makes my dark heart grin.

32:06.299 --> 32:08.426
Thornhill chose you to be
her murderous marionette,

32:08.509 --> 32:10.970
not just because she saw
some Hyde hibernating inside you,

32:11.054 --> 32:12.722
but because she saw the real you.

32:14.015 --> 32:15.308
An expendable nobody.

32:16.142 --> 32:17.769
A feeble-minded schoolyard bully

32:17.852 --> 32:21.314
with nothing to offer to the world
except for subpar barista skills.

32:22.482 --> 32:26.110
Your fleeting moment of notoriety
will fade quicker than your generic looks.

32:26.736 --> 32:30.490
Thinking of you rotting away in this cell
in anonymous mediocrity, that…

32:32.075 --> 32:33.409
is the best revenge.

32:33.493 --> 32:35.453
[feral growling]

32:36.371 --> 32:37.830
-[Tyler screams]
-[electricity sparks]

32:40.750 --> 32:42.001
I don't need to visit again.

32:42.085 --> 32:43.294
[Tyler panting]

32:43.378 --> 32:45.964
I already take up enough space
in your twisted head.

32:51.052 --> 32:52.804
[bellows]

32:58.768 --> 33:00.645
[Tyler's bellow echoing]

33:11.072 --> 33:15.576
[Orloff] The human brain
is the hungriest organ in the body,

33:16.077 --> 33:18.746
consuming 20%--

33:20.289 --> 33:21.749
Who did that?

33:22.792 --> 33:23.626
Go on!

33:24.752 --> 33:26.170
Speak up!

33:27.964 --> 33:29.132
[yelps]

33:29.632 --> 33:30.717
[class snickering]

33:30.800 --> 33:33.344
Listen up, people.

33:33.928 --> 33:36.931
-[Eugene] Psst.
-Unless the perpetrator reveals…

33:37.015 --> 33:38.766
We've got a problem. Come on.

33:38.850 --> 33:42.186
[Orloff] …you'll be spending
the rest of the semester in detention.

33:42.937 --> 33:44.647
I'm watching you two.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.650
[frantic, suspenseful music playing]

33:47.734 --> 33:48.818
[Pugsley] What?

33:49.318 --> 33:51.195
Your pet zombie, Slurp,

33:51.279 --> 33:52.780
he's escaped.

33:57.910 --> 33:59.996
[Bruno] So you didn't have
your driving lesson?

34:00.079 --> 34:01.622
[Enid] Nope. He was a no-show.

34:13.342 --> 34:15.887
So, want to study
for Orloff's anatomy test?

34:16.387 --> 34:18.556
-He may be a head in a jar, but…
-Yeah.

34:19.057 --> 34:21.184
[indistinct chatter]

34:21.768 --> 34:22.769
[Enid chuckles]

34:26.522 --> 34:28.274
[Enid] How'd that get in here?

34:31.486 --> 34:33.029
It's for Thing.

34:36.199 --> 34:37.283
Thing?

34:37.366 --> 34:38.993
[ragged breathing]

34:39.077 --> 34:40.286
[Enid] Anyone home?

34:41.871 --> 34:44.207
Thing? Have you been drinking?

34:45.249 --> 34:47.668
How is that even…
You know what? It doesn't matter.

34:47.752 --> 34:49.420
Could you just give us a second?

34:50.046 --> 34:51.339
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

34:51.839 --> 34:54.383
[whispers] Thing. You've got a package.

34:54.467 --> 34:58.262
I don't know if maybe it's for Prank Day,
or maybe it's from Wednesday's stalker.

34:59.472 --> 35:01.891
[quirky, eccentric music playing]

35:04.268 --> 35:07.396
It's your mugshot from
the Normal, Illinois police department.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.482
There's a town called Normal?

35:09.565 --> 35:11.526
Who's Fernando Fingertips?

35:12.110 --> 35:13.444
Your first alias?

35:13.945 --> 35:15.655
Yeah, it is very catchy.

35:20.034 --> 35:22.537
"Found this while cleaning out
an old safe house."

35:22.620 --> 35:25.123
"Happy birthday
to my buddy from another body."

35:25.206 --> 35:28.501
"Snickers and wet willies,
your partner in crime, Fester."

35:29.502 --> 35:31.629
Thing! Is it your birthday?

35:32.588 --> 35:34.257
No, Wednesday didn't tell me!

35:34.340 --> 35:37.552
Did the entire Addams family
forget it was your birthday?

35:38.636 --> 35:41.055
I'm really sorry. You know what?

35:41.139 --> 35:43.599
You are an honorary member
of the Wolf Pack.

35:43.683 --> 35:46.144
Why don't we take you out tonight
to celebrate?

35:46.769 --> 35:47.812
[thud]

35:47.895 --> 35:49.647
Bruno! Oh my God, oh my God!

35:49.730 --> 35:51.649
-What happened? Are you--
-[thud, clattering]

36:07.665 --> 36:09.333
[knocking at door]

36:09.417 --> 36:10.293
Yes?

36:15.423 --> 36:17.550
Do you have an update on Mrs. Addams?

36:17.633 --> 36:19.510
I gave her the donor list.

36:19.594 --> 36:21.137
She's going through the names,

36:21.220 --> 36:24.098
and we'll meet at the end of the week
to discuss strategy.

36:24.682 --> 36:27.393
And you drew her attention
to numero uno on that list?

36:28.686 --> 36:31.355
Unfortunately,
she and her mother are estranged.

36:32.648 --> 36:33.983
How estranged?

36:34.567 --> 36:36.235
She refuses to call her.

36:39.113 --> 36:42.200
Hester Frump is the linchpin
to this whole campaign.

36:42.283 --> 36:44.118
She is the 50-foot shark

36:44.202 --> 36:48.331
that will signal the other big fish
that Nevermore is worth preserving.

36:49.332 --> 36:51.792
Why don't you have
that conversation with Mrs. Addams?

36:52.376 --> 36:55.087
Because you can be
so much more persuasive.

36:57.715 --> 37:00.509
You're not seriously asking me
to siren song her?

37:00.593 --> 37:01.844
Of course not.

37:02.428 --> 37:03.554
I'm ordering you.

37:08.267 --> 37:11.437
You will never try and coerce me again.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.442
[Bianca sighs in relief]

37:16.943 --> 37:18.569
Nice try, Ms. Barclay.

37:20.029 --> 37:21.197
Yeah.

37:21.822 --> 37:23.032
[clicks tongue]

37:23.115 --> 37:27.161
Little souvenir I picked up in
a dinky antique shop in the Florida Keys.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.537
It's beautiful, isn't it?

37:29.121 --> 37:33.251
Oh, and this here is made up
of itty-bitty pieces of Corinthian coral,

37:33.334 --> 37:35.920
making me impervious to your siren song.

37:36.003 --> 37:37.713
I keep it on me at all times.

37:38.714 --> 37:39.924
[Dort clears throat]

37:40.675 --> 37:42.343
You see, the key to winning

37:42.843 --> 37:44.845
in both golf and life

37:44.929 --> 37:46.681
is keeping your eye on the ball.

37:46.764 --> 37:48.641
So let me help you focus.

37:48.724 --> 37:51.352
We both know
that I hold your future in my hand.

37:51.435 --> 37:54.897
I could either lift you up… or crush you.

37:55.648 --> 37:56.691
Understood?

38:00.903 --> 38:02.697
Now use your gift

38:02.780 --> 38:06.659
and get Morticia Addams
and her beloved mother on our side.

38:16.585 --> 38:17.545
[door closes]

38:17.628 --> 38:18.629
[grim music playing]

38:18.713 --> 38:21.549
[muffled thumping, rattling]

38:23.718 --> 38:24.677
Thing?

38:26.679 --> 38:28.347
[frantic music fluttering]

38:28.431 --> 38:29.974
Wait, where's Enid?

38:30.933 --> 38:32.351
[phone vibrating]

38:38.024 --> 38:39.692
[mysterious voice]
Do I have your attention?

38:39.775 --> 38:41.777
Who are you, and where's Enid?

38:41.861 --> 38:43.571
The game has just begun.

38:43.654 --> 38:45.865
You have 30 minutes
to find your werewolf friend,

38:45.948 --> 38:47.241
or I put her down.

38:47.825 --> 38:50.202
Involve anyone else, and game over.

38:50.745 --> 38:51.829
I am watching.

38:52.496 --> 38:54.457
Tick tock, Ms. Addams.

38:54.540 --> 38:56.625
[tense music building]

39:10.097 --> 39:12.099
[eerie, distressing music playing]

39:21.400 --> 39:23.402
[breathing shakily]

39:26.322 --> 39:27.490
Bruno!

39:29.283 --> 39:30.409
Bruno!

39:31.243 --> 39:32.411
Are you okay?

39:33.079 --> 39:34.246
Enid…

39:35.915 --> 39:37.249
Where are we?

39:38.250 --> 39:40.211
I think we're in Iago Tower.

39:41.629 --> 39:44.548
Doesn't look like anyone's
been up here in a long time.

39:44.632 --> 39:48.761
They closed it off years ago after it was
damaged in some freak electrical storm.

39:52.515 --> 39:55.684
[Enid strains, struggles]

39:57.311 --> 39:59.021
Who would do this to us?

40:03.984 --> 40:05.653
Okay, Ajax!

40:06.695 --> 40:08.906
Great prank! Now let us go.

40:10.699 --> 40:11.826
Ajax?

40:12.868 --> 40:14.078
[metallic clang]

40:17.832 --> 40:19.583
[distressing music intensifies]

40:21.127 --> 40:22.628
I don't think this is a prank.

40:23.504 --> 40:25.506
[frantic, suspenseful music playing]

40:29.552 --> 40:32.096
[Capri] Wednesday,
what are you doing out here?

40:32.179 --> 40:33.639
[Wednesday] Looking for my roommate.

40:33.722 --> 40:36.225
[Capri] That's a coincidence.
I've been looking for you.

40:36.308 --> 40:39.145
I'm putting together
an orchestra for the gala.

40:39.228 --> 40:41.856
-I'd like you to play cello.
-I don't have time for this right now.

40:41.939 --> 40:45.901
And besides, when you heard me play,
you were hardly complimentary.

40:45.985 --> 40:49.405
Oh, come on. All I was saying was
if you want to be great,

40:49.488 --> 40:52.366
let the music control you.

40:53.826 --> 40:57.413
Otherwise, you'll just be…
playing the notes.

40:57.496 --> 40:58.789
Mechanical.

41:00.541 --> 41:02.293
Rehearsal 3:00 p.m. Friday.

41:02.376 --> 41:04.086
I hope to see you there.

41:09.967 --> 41:11.302
These aren't letters.

41:12.178 --> 41:13.137
They're notes.

41:23.397 --> 41:24.773
The heart is an organ.

41:36.827 --> 41:39.705
-D-E-A-D.
-[notes ringing out]

41:47.254 --> 41:48.464
I'll try them together.

41:48.547 --> 41:50.341
[ominous chord surges]

41:50.424 --> 41:51.550
[gears clanking]

41:55.638 --> 41:56.597
Let's go.

42:13.280 --> 42:16.784
[Enid] If only there was a full moon,
we'd be out of here in no time.

42:18.160 --> 42:19.662
I'm really sorry, Bruno.

42:21.163 --> 42:22.164
This isn't your fault.

42:22.248 --> 42:24.625
[sighs] I mean, it kind of is.

42:24.708 --> 42:27.711
Whatever's going on here
is clearly connected to my roommate.

42:27.795 --> 42:30.422
She's like this dark north star
for psycho killers.

42:31.340 --> 42:33.050
Why are you friends with her?

42:34.885 --> 42:36.470
Because even though Wednesday

42:36.554 --> 42:38.973
is literally the tunnel
at the end of my light…

42:39.056 --> 42:41.058
[delicate, emotional music playing]

42:41.141 --> 42:43.269
…I can't imagine my life
without her in it.

42:45.729 --> 42:47.982
I think it's cool
how you're her ride or die.

42:48.649 --> 42:50.192
Emphasis on die at the moment.

42:50.276 --> 42:51.527
[Bruno chuckles softly]

42:52.611 --> 42:54.196
I wish I had someone like that.

43:01.537 --> 43:03.622
We have to find a way to get out of here.

43:05.249 --> 43:06.333
We can't break these chains,

43:06.417 --> 43:09.169
but maybe we could wriggle out
if we find the right angle.

43:11.005 --> 43:13.090
[Enid muttering indistinctly]

43:13.173 --> 43:15.050
-Your shoulder.
-Get your feet around.

43:20.639 --> 43:22.975
I thought you put
new batteries in this thing.

43:25.060 --> 43:26.895
Does this look fully powered to you?

43:34.236 --> 43:36.238
[chilling music playing]

43:37.531 --> 43:38.616
[jolting stinger]

44:05.142 --> 44:06.602
This is Iago Tower.

44:09.146 --> 44:10.272
Come on.

44:13.734 --> 44:16.862
-Sorry, can you just… Wait. No…
-Just your shoulder…

44:18.906 --> 44:20.699
[both breathing heavily]

44:22.242 --> 44:23.869
-[Enid chuckles]
-Hey.

44:24.495 --> 44:27.331
-Hey.
-That didn't work.

44:29.083 --> 44:30.334
[claws clattering]

44:33.337 --> 44:34.463
Are you okay?

44:34.546 --> 44:35.547
I'm fine.

44:35.631 --> 44:38.550
This happens sometimes
when I'm stressed or nervous.

44:38.634 --> 44:40.302
It's just wolf whimpers.

44:41.804 --> 44:44.139
Lupin late bloomers
usually suffer from it.

44:46.433 --> 44:48.686
I was the last in my family to wolf out.

44:50.771 --> 44:51.772
No way.

44:52.690 --> 44:53.732
Me too.

44:53.816 --> 44:55.651
I had the nervous claw thing too.

44:56.694 --> 44:59.154
-Have you tried box breathing?
-[whispers] No.

44:59.738 --> 45:01.657
[inhales deeply]

45:01.740 --> 45:02.741
Four counts in.

45:04.118 --> 45:05.411
Four holding.

45:07.788 --> 45:08.789
Four out.

45:08.872 --> 45:10.874
[delicate, emotional music continues]

45:24.722 --> 45:26.724
[foreboding music building]

45:38.110 --> 45:39.403
Enid!

45:39.486 --> 45:40.988
Wednesday! Oh, thank God!

45:41.071 --> 45:43.031
You need to get us out of this!

45:43.699 --> 45:45.492
Thing, pick their locks.

45:48.537 --> 45:49.538
[Enid shrieks]

45:50.998 --> 45:52.249
Thing, watch out!

45:54.251 --> 45:55.377
Thing! You okay?

46:01.884 --> 46:03.051
[rattling overhead]

46:07.097 --> 46:08.348
Wednesday!

46:08.432 --> 46:09.683
Where are you going?

46:12.019 --> 46:13.437
[perilous music escalating]

46:26.492 --> 46:28.035
[Wednesday] "What don't you see?"

46:30.996 --> 46:32.414
[Enid] Oh my God! Oh my God!

46:36.293 --> 46:37.836
[Wednesday] Poe, Dante,

46:37.920 --> 46:39.421
Shelley, Dickens…

46:40.088 --> 46:41.882
Wednesday, you need to hurry!

46:43.175 --> 46:45.719
Each stack is the collected work
of a famous author.

46:47.805 --> 46:49.723
[Enid yelps] Wednesday!

46:49.807 --> 46:52.226
[Wednesday] Proust, Tolstoy…

46:54.102 --> 46:56.355
The answer must be a book that's missing.

46:57.898 --> 47:00.609
[Enid] I swear if I survive this,
I'm demanding a spa day!

47:00.692 --> 47:01.819
Wells…

47:02.444 --> 47:05.030
-Baby-Sitter's Club?
-How many are in that one?

47:05.948 --> 47:07.825
-131.
-[Enid] Dammit. That's all of them.

47:07.908 --> 47:10.786
-Unless you're counting graphic novels--
-Enough, Enid.

47:12.329 --> 47:14.665
[panicked breathing]

47:14.748 --> 47:16.083
But what you don't see…

47:17.668 --> 47:20.504
Of course!
The Invisible Man by H.G. Wells!

47:20.587 --> 47:22.005
[Bruno] Hey!

47:25.217 --> 47:26.385
Wednesday, time's up!

47:28.720 --> 47:30.764
-[keys clacking]
-[typewriter dings]

47:31.515 --> 47:33.016
[clanking slows, halts]

47:35.435 --> 47:36.728
[Enid and Bruno panting]

47:42.776 --> 47:44.319
Wednesday, you did it!

47:49.491 --> 47:50.784
[Wednesday sighs]

47:54.997 --> 47:57.875
[slow, measured clapping]

47:58.667 --> 47:59.751
Who's there?

48:08.677 --> 48:10.637
Happy Prank Day, Wednesday.

48:12.222 --> 48:15.475
My crazed stalker
is an invisible 13-year-old?

48:17.394 --> 48:19.521
[eerie, unsettling music playing]

48:20.272 --> 48:22.399
[stalker] We haven't been
properly introduced.

48:22.482 --> 48:24.067
I'm Agnes DeMille,

48:24.151 --> 48:26.069
your number one superfan.

48:27.446 --> 48:31.116
You don't seriously expect me to believe
you pulled off this elaborate prank solo.

48:31.909 --> 48:34.036
I had a little help from some DaVincis.

48:34.119 --> 48:37.331
After I blackmailed them
with incriminating Snapchat pics.

48:37.414 --> 48:38.999
Perks of being invisible.

48:39.082 --> 48:43.712
I just asked myself, W-W-W…

48:45.088 --> 48:46.089
D.

48:46.173 --> 48:47.507
What would Wednesday do?

48:47.591 --> 48:49.676
That's my line, you little psycho!

48:49.760 --> 48:53.430
I knew if I came up with the most
twisted game, I'd get your attention.

48:53.972 --> 48:57.267
I hope it's lived up
to your exacting standards.

48:58.268 --> 49:00.520
Admit it, you're a little impressed.

49:00.604 --> 49:04.232
I can't believe we were almost
perforated by your fangirl mini-me.

49:06.109 --> 49:07.611
Why don't I return the favor?

49:07.694 --> 49:10.822
Park your claws, Rainbow Barbie.

49:10.906 --> 49:15.494
Besides, I got you some alone time
with the pack hottie. You're welcome.

49:16.370 --> 49:18.956
You almost burned my novel
at the Founder's Pyre.

49:19.039 --> 49:20.791
[Agnes] That was just an appetizer.

49:21.416 --> 49:23.168
This was the main course.

49:23.251 --> 49:26.171
Then why kill Galpin
and place his eyeball on Enid's cushion?

49:26.254 --> 49:28.215
That eyeball was real?

49:28.298 --> 49:29.716
I didn't kill Galpin.

49:30.634 --> 49:32.344
I wanted to become your friend.

49:33.053 --> 49:34.763
Not your next murder case.

49:36.181 --> 49:38.725
Took this as a… souvenir.

49:40.727 --> 49:42.688
I already scrolled through his texts.

49:44.064 --> 49:45.482
And his e-mails.

49:45.565 --> 49:47.609
So if you didn't kill him, then who did?

49:48.193 --> 49:49.611
I can help you find out.

49:52.781 --> 49:53.782
[chuckles]

49:56.952 --> 49:59.579
Only Wednesday Addams
would have multiple stalkers.

50:00.372 --> 50:01.832
Room for one more?

50:01.915 --> 50:03.333
Wannabes take the stairs.

50:15.929 --> 50:17.931
[thunder rumbling]

50:24.021 --> 50:25.272
[Morticia] Bianca!

50:25.856 --> 50:28.483
What a surprise. Please, come on in.

50:30.777 --> 50:32.696
Did you forget something, dear?

50:33.196 --> 50:35.115
Actually, I did.

50:37.367 --> 50:38.952
You must contact your mother,

50:39.703 --> 50:41.371
invite her to the gala,

50:41.955 --> 50:43.874
and secure a large donation.

50:44.416 --> 50:47.169
She is your highest priority.

50:49.004 --> 50:49.921
Yes.

50:50.839 --> 50:51.840
That's it.

50:52.799 --> 50:53.800
Mama.

50:54.843 --> 50:56.094
I should call her.

50:59.931 --> 51:03.560
You'll have no memory I was here,
Mrs. Addams.

51:09.649 --> 51:10.650
Good night.

51:28.085 --> 51:29.086
[thumping]

51:32.464 --> 51:33.924
I forgot your birthday.

51:34.007 --> 51:35.383
And that's inexcusable.

51:36.343 --> 51:38.720
I hope this makes up for my memory lapse.

51:42.349 --> 51:44.017
It's an antique thumbscrew.

51:44.601 --> 51:45.769
Napoleonic era.

51:45.852 --> 51:47.521
Designed by Anatole Deibler,

51:47.604 --> 51:49.606
France's most notorious torturer.

51:51.149 --> 51:53.026
I'm willing to be your first victim.

52:01.451 --> 52:03.370
I'm concerned about Enid too.

52:04.037 --> 52:07.332
Unmasking my flame-haired stalker
was an unwelcome distraction.

52:08.875 --> 52:12.963
If I'm able to regain my psychic ability,
I think I'll be able to save Enid

52:13.046 --> 52:15.549
and figure out
who killed Galpin and Bradbury.

52:16.842 --> 52:19.094
Let's take another look at Goody's book.

52:19.177 --> 52:20.929
Did you find any answers in there?

52:25.100 --> 52:26.184
Where is it?

52:30.021 --> 52:31.481
My mother took my book?

52:50.417 --> 52:52.419
[Slurp gurgling]

53:02.429 --> 53:04.306
[Dort on phone]
You've reached Principal Dort.

53:04.389 --> 53:05.891
I'm unavailable, but don't panic.

53:05.974 --> 53:08.018
Leave a message,
and I'll get right back to you.

53:08.101 --> 53:11.271
-Always remember, Nevermore 4evermore.
-[voicemail beeps]

53:11.354 --> 53:12.898
This is Gabe Packard.

53:12.981 --> 53:16.693
I'm informing you that I am no longer
teaching Nevermore students.

53:16.776 --> 53:19.613
Enid Sinclair has pushed me over the edge.

53:24.326 --> 53:25.327
[gasps]

53:25.410 --> 53:27.412
[chilling music playing]

53:31.124 --> 53:32.125
[sputtering]

53:34.628 --> 53:36.630
[car beeping]

53:42.469 --> 53:43.970
[chilling music oscillating]

53:52.604 --> 53:53.438
What?

53:54.439 --> 53:55.357
[jolting stinger]

53:56.775 --> 53:57.609
[screaming]

53:59.569 --> 54:00.737
[Slurp snarls]

54:09.120 --> 54:10.330
[music trails off]

54:10.413 --> 54:12.415
[jauntily macabre outro music playing]
