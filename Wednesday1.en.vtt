Don't put too much pressure on it.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.876
No pressure. Right. Got it.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.212
Catch up with you later
at the lupin cages?

16:45.295 --> 16:47.464
-With the others.
-Absolutely, Bruno.

16:48.590 --> 16:49.591
Can't wait.

16:52.803 --> 16:53.721
[exhales]

16:53.804 --> 16:55.305
How was your vacay?

16:55.389 --> 16:57.474
Because I had the best summer ever,

16:57.558 --> 16:59.768
and I've been dying
to tell you all about it.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.563
I'm sure I'll want to kill you
after you tell me, so…

17:02.646 --> 17:03.814
we both win.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.777
Well, I'll spare you the details, but…

17:08.861 --> 17:12.740
I did get you a gift
at Lupinpalooza in Golden Gate Park.

17:13.741 --> 17:15.492
Don't worry. It's not a snood.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.165
Get it? Like Beowulf?

17:21.248 --> 17:23.250
I thought you'd love
the literary reference.

17:23.333 --> 17:26.295
Nothing like a bad pun to throw dirt
on the coffin of epic poetry.

17:27.463 --> 17:30.174
I got you a gift as well.
From my summer travels.

17:30.257 --> 17:32.426
[somber music playing]

17:36.013 --> 17:38.015
[Enid, shakily] Uh… Oh.

17:39.224 --> 17:40.059
Thank you.

17:40.809 --> 17:44.438
I mean, it is a little creepy,
but, um, the curls are super soft.

17:44.521 --> 17:45.981
It's made from real human hair.

17:47.316 --> 17:48.317
Hmm.

17:49.026 --> 17:52.321
I just have so many goals this year.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.364
[sighs] I wanna secure
my place in the pack,

17:54.448 --> 17:57.409
become dance troupe captain,
and finally join the Nightshades.

17:57.493 --> 17:58.494
What about you?

17:59.536 --> 18:02.289
Avoid people and work on
my new Viper de la Muerte novel.

18:02.873 --> 18:05.042
Doesn't sound like
much of a personal evolution.

18:05.125 --> 18:07.127
I don't evolve. I cocoon.

18:07.878 --> 18:10.589
Speaking of your novel,
was that publisher interested?

18:13.175 --> 18:15.302
I call it death by a thousand notes.

18:15.385 --> 18:16.637
Ooh…

18:17.763 --> 18:19.598
This one here just looks like a typo.

18:21.225 --> 18:24.686
It's not. That's the Old English spelling
for dismemberment.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.814
This novel was two years of my life.

18:26.897 --> 18:30.359
They'll have to pry it out of my cold,
dead hands before I change a single word.

18:30.442 --> 18:31.527
[knocking at door]

18:32.361 --> 18:35.072
That better not be
any more brattish autograph hounds.

18:35.155 --> 18:38.075
Tell me about it.
We seriously need to set some boundaries.

18:38.158 --> 18:41.245
Let's post hours to sign stuff
in the student lounge.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.332
Hi, Wednesday. How was your summer?

18:45.415 --> 18:46.834
I scalped a serial killer.

18:47.459 --> 18:48.377
Huh.

18:48.877 --> 18:51.213
Is, uh… Is Enid around?

18:52.047 --> 18:53.841
She left earlier with the pack.

18:53.924 --> 18:56.468
I threatened to neuter them
if they didn't get out.

18:56.552 --> 18:58.428
Well, would you mind giving her this?

19:06.270 --> 19:08.355
[sighs] Thanks for covering.

19:08.438 --> 19:11.775
I know the only thing you hate
more than color is relationship drama.

19:11.859 --> 19:15.362
Machiavelli once said that friendship is
watching a person's slow drip of miseries

19:15.445 --> 19:18.699
and feeling honored to be present
for their most dismal moments.

19:18.782 --> 19:19.950
Does that mean…

19:20.033 --> 19:22.411
In 25 words or less. Go.

19:23.245 --> 19:25.581
I'm not sure
how I feel about Ajax anymore.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.583
He's sweet and cute,

19:27.666 --> 19:30.752
but he's still in love with the old me,
and I've changed.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.504
Hey, look at that. Exactly 25 words.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.173
Talk to him and get it over with.

19:34.256 --> 19:37.176
If I do that, then it'll be
like an arrow through his--

19:37.259 --> 19:38.343
[Enid yelps]

19:38.427 --> 19:39.428
Holy crap!

19:42.723 --> 19:44.850
[suspenseful music playing]

19:45.601 --> 19:48.854
"Welcome back, Wednesday.
I'm still watching."

19:49.855 --> 19:52.691
-Wait. You have a stalker?
-Don't be jealous.

19:55.903 --> 19:57.487
[distorted audio whooshes]

20:05.787 --> 20:07.789
I didn't see the stalker.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.417
You've got a little something.

20:11.585 --> 20:12.502
It's nothing.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.095
[gasping]

20:23.972 --> 20:25.766
Caliban Hall.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.061
My old stomping ground.

20:29.144 --> 20:30.771
[laughing]

20:32.981 --> 20:34.274
Hi, Pugsley. I'm--

20:34.858 --> 20:35.859
Ah!

20:36.735 --> 20:38.862
Electricity. Cool.

20:39.446 --> 20:41.365
And you must be Janet.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.575
Wednesday told us all about you.

20:43.659 --> 20:46.495
[Gomez] Caliban. I put that up.

20:46.578 --> 20:50.332
Sue and I weren't sure we wanted
Eugene to come back to Nevermore.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.541
But he insisted.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.168
I did help save the school.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.921
[gasps] I remember that day.

20:56.004 --> 20:58.006
What was it like getting gutted by a Hyde?

21:00.133 --> 21:02.177
I still wake up screaming sometimes.

21:02.761 --> 21:03.595
Whoa.

21:04.137 --> 21:05.472
That's… awesome!

21:06.098 --> 21:07.891
[Janet] Why don't we give the boys
some space?

21:09.851 --> 21:11.937
Lurch will be up with your things.

21:12.020 --> 21:13.772
And we'll see you downstairs.

21:18.652 --> 21:20.320
Remember, boys,

21:20.404 --> 21:23.699
the friends you make here
will be your brothers for life.

21:24.741 --> 21:26.118
You'll kill for each other,

21:26.785 --> 21:29.079
and provide alibis.

21:29.162 --> 21:30.664
-[Eugene chuckles weakly]
-Hmm.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.376
[overwhelmed exhale]

21:35.877 --> 21:37.546
What's with the bugs?

21:37.629 --> 21:39.464
[Eugene] At first,
I could only control bees,

21:39.548 --> 21:42.092
but lately I've been able
to control other insects too.

21:43.093 --> 21:44.344
Watch this.

21:47.347 --> 21:50.017
They're so… juicy.

21:51.268 --> 21:53.228
Perfect for late-night munchies.

21:54.479 --> 21:56.898
They're pets, not snacks.

22:01.403 --> 22:03.905
Maybe after we unpack, we could hang out?

22:03.989 --> 22:06.074
Actually, I'm meeting up
with some other guys.

22:06.158 --> 22:06.992
I could tag along.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.745
They're kind of new-ish friends.

22:09.828 --> 22:12.205
I don't mind.
It's not like I have any old ones.

22:12.789 --> 22:15.334
I owe your sister a lot,
which is why I agreed to be your roommate.

22:15.417 --> 22:18.045
Let's just see
how this pans out first, okay?

22:19.588 --> 22:21.173
Yeah. Sure.

22:22.299 --> 22:23.133
[knocking at door]

22:23.216 --> 22:24.676
Yo, bee boy!

22:25.635 --> 22:28.638
-Oh, you've grown.
-Ajax. What are you doing here?

22:29.306 --> 22:31.099
I'm your new resident advisor.

22:31.183 --> 22:34.519
-If you have any questions--
-Can you stone me with your snakes?

22:34.603 --> 22:35.645
That's not gonna happen.

22:35.729 --> 22:38.732
Are you and Enid still together?
Or she finally come to her senses?

22:39.775 --> 22:41.985
Do you two have
any dorm-related questions?

22:42.569 --> 22:46.615
Okay. Well, welcome to Caliban.
It's going to be a great year.

22:56.583 --> 22:57.834
[student 1] That's her.

22:57.918 --> 23:00.045
-[squeals] I can't believe it.
-[student 2] My God.

23:00.128 --> 23:02.839
I liked it better
when I was feared and hated.

23:06.385 --> 23:09.763
Principal Dort, have you met
our little angel of death?

23:09.846 --> 23:13.600
Yep. I'm sure Wednesday would enjoy
having you around more this year.

23:13.683 --> 23:15.227
What do you mean, around more?

23:15.310 --> 23:19.022
Principal Dort just asked me to chair
the Gala Fundraising Committee.

23:19.106 --> 23:21.817
[Dort] Vincent Thorpe chaired
the last three years,

23:21.900 --> 23:24.820
but after Xavier was
falsely accused of murder,

23:24.903 --> 23:27.697
he pulled his son
and his endowment from Nevermore.

23:27.781 --> 23:29.408
Xavier's not coming back this year?

23:29.491 --> 23:31.910
He's heading to Reichenbach Academy
in Switzerland.

23:31.993 --> 23:34.746
I spent the summer there
as an exchange student.

23:34.830 --> 23:38.375
I remember, darling.
It was the longest summer of my life.

23:38.458 --> 23:39.292
[Gomez] Oh…

23:41.169 --> 23:43.338
I realize I've ambushed you.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.590
No, I usually enjoy a good ambush.

23:45.674 --> 23:48.176
Especially when it involves daggers.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.011
[Morticia snickers, coos]

23:50.095 --> 23:51.888
Why don't you think about it overnight?

23:53.265 --> 23:56.643
Tish and I will discuss it
on the ride home.

23:57.144 --> 24:00.313
Actually, I… I was hoping
to keep you a little closer.

24:05.277 --> 24:08.738
I thought the gardener's cottage
was reserved for faculty.

24:09.364 --> 24:11.408
Marilyn Thornhill lived here last year,

24:11.491 --> 24:13.243
but thanks to Wednesday,

24:13.326 --> 24:16.204
she is now enjoying much tighter quarters,

24:16.288 --> 24:17.330
in prison.

24:17.414 --> 24:19.916
Not pine box tight, but a girl can dream.

24:20.417 --> 24:22.043
It's yours for the night.

24:22.127 --> 24:24.838
And if you decide
to become our gala chair,

24:24.921 --> 24:27.299
consider this your home away from home.

24:27.382 --> 24:28.633
I'll wait outside.

24:40.437 --> 24:41.438
[Morticia gasps]

24:42.439 --> 24:44.524
Who decorated this place?

24:44.608 --> 24:46.485
A homicidal maniac.

24:46.568 --> 24:48.862
Now, you shouldn't cast aspersions, dear.

24:49.362 --> 24:52.782
Not all homicidal maniacs
have such ghastly taste.

24:52.866 --> 24:56.286
Nothing your putrefying touch
couldn't fix, cara bella.

24:57.245 --> 24:59.831
Hey, Dad, I found
some old mousetraps under the sink.

24:59.915 --> 25:01.291
-You want a snack?
-Yeah.

25:03.877 --> 25:06.129
Why would you want
to be in charge of a gala?

25:07.214 --> 25:11.259
Well, I wasn't expecting
things to change so quickly.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.929
Pugsley shot up
like poison oak this summer,

25:14.554 --> 25:16.890
and now that you're both at Nevermore,

25:16.973 --> 25:20.435
I have been wondering
what my next chapter might be.

25:22.103 --> 25:24.648
The thought of you and Father
in the house alone unsupervised

25:24.731 --> 25:28.068
fills me with a sense of dread
I usually reserve for costumed mascots.

25:28.151 --> 25:31.655
But I won't consider this
if it makes you uncomfortable.

25:32.155 --> 25:33.990
I was born uncomfortable, Mother.

25:36.493 --> 25:39.538
I know it's been hard… with Goody gone,

25:39.621 --> 25:43.416
and no one from our bloodline reaching out
to be your new spirit guide.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.502
But if I was here,

25:46.378 --> 25:48.255
I could be of assistance.

25:48.338 --> 25:50.257
Temporarily, of course,

25:50.340 --> 25:52.801
until a new guide presents themselves.

25:53.301 --> 25:54.803
You're a Dove, I'm a Raven.

25:54.886 --> 25:57.097
We're on different paths.
You said so yourself.

25:57.180 --> 25:59.432
I've had experience with Ravens.

26:02.143 --> 26:03.687
Are you talking about your sister?

26:06.273 --> 26:09.025
You've never been very forthcoming
about Aunt Ophelia.

26:16.992 --> 26:18.702
You remind me a lot of her.

26:19.995 --> 26:22.038
Especially as you've gotten older.

26:22.956 --> 26:25.000
You don't need to worry about me, Mother.

26:25.917 --> 26:28.044
You should be focused on Pugsley.

26:28.128 --> 26:30.964
We both know being tall and male
will only get him so far.

26:31.047 --> 26:33.258
Besides, he's got
the brains of a dung beetle

26:33.341 --> 26:35.594
and the ambition of a French bureaucrat.

26:38.722 --> 26:40.807
-[door squeaks open]
-What is it, querida?

26:40.890 --> 26:41.891
[door closes]

26:42.892 --> 26:45.270
Wednesday is hiding things from me.

26:46.855 --> 26:49.274
I will not let history repeat itself.

26:49.357 --> 26:51.359
[somber, thoughtful music playing]

26:57.949 --> 26:59.242
I can handle my mother.

27:01.244 --> 27:03.872
I'm not asking for her help
because I don't need it.

27:03.955 --> 27:05.498
I don't need yours either.

27:06.416 --> 27:08.543
Keep your nosy fingers out of my business.

27:09.794 --> 27:11.921
[siren wailing in distance]

27:12.005 --> 27:13.006
[siren halts]

27:14.424 --> 27:16.426
[chilling music playing]

27:20.013 --> 27:23.475
[officer] The victim's Carl Bradbury,
local private investigator.

27:23.558 --> 27:24.684
Real sleaze.

27:24.768 --> 27:27.687
Witnesses are Greg Mulligan
and Debbie Prizeman.

27:27.771 --> 27:31.524
Greg's the manager of the Piggly Wiggly
and Debbie's one of his cashiers.

27:31.608 --> 27:36.196
So Bradbury was out here catching
our supermarket sweethearts in a tryst,

27:36.279 --> 27:39.157
when he got attacked
by a squad of kamikaze crows.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.993
[officer] This is a first,
even for Jericho.

27:42.077 --> 27:44.287
[Santiago] Get the body to the morgue
before he gets ripe.

27:46.748 --> 27:48.792
Wednesday, can I help you?

27:48.875 --> 27:50.418
Just admiring the view.

27:52.504 --> 27:53.713
Sheriff Santiago.

27:54.547 --> 27:56.466
I promise to be
better than my predecessor.

27:56.549 --> 27:58.134
That's an exceptionally low bar.

27:58.218 --> 27:59.219
[scoffs]

28:01.971 --> 28:03.306
[car doors slamming]

28:03.390 --> 28:05.100
[engine turning over]

28:05.183 --> 28:06.184
[tires skidding]

28:07.018 --> 28:08.770
[tense, frantic music playing]

28:12.232 --> 28:13.858
[grunts, groans]

28:14.442 --> 28:15.443
Ow…

28:16.486 --> 28:18.613
Galpin? What are you doing here?

28:18.697 --> 28:22.325
The victim was a friend of mine.
Carl Bradbury.

28:22.409 --> 28:25.912
We were working a case together,
and that's what got him killed.

28:25.995 --> 28:27.706
I play cello, not violin.

28:28.581 --> 28:31.459
Bradbury stumbled onto something.
Said it could affect Outcasts.

28:31.543 --> 28:34.963
-We're starting to scratch the surface.
-You care about Outcasts now?

28:35.630 --> 28:36.965
My son is an Outcast.

28:37.048 --> 28:38.717
Yeah, I know what he's done, but…

28:38.800 --> 28:41.052
Ms. Thornhill,
she turned him into a monster.

28:41.136 --> 28:42.804
Tyler was always a monster.

28:43.430 --> 28:47.475
She just unlocked that in him.
People don't change. Look at you.

28:47.559 --> 28:48.935
You're still a broken, deluded man

28:49.018 --> 28:50.854
who can't hide behind
his tin badge anymore.

28:50.937 --> 28:52.605
Badge never stopped you, did it?

28:54.649 --> 28:57.068
I could use your help
getting to the bottom of this.

28:58.278 --> 29:01.740
You didn't just wind up
at that crime scene by accident, Addams.

29:01.823 --> 29:04.576
You were drawn to it
like a moth to a flame.

29:07.787 --> 29:11.040
It's a shame your psychological insight
couldn't help you save your own son.

29:11.124 --> 29:13.126
[tense music warbling]

29:39.068 --> 29:44.240
Tonight, you're gonna hear
the tale of the Skull Tree.

29:45.700 --> 29:49.245
It's Caliban Hall tradition to tell
this story on the first night of school.

29:49.329 --> 29:50.955
[thunder crashes]

29:54.626 --> 29:58.838
[Ajax] There once was a brilliant boy
with a fragile heart.

29:59.839 --> 30:01.549
He spent his days in bed,

30:01.633 --> 30:04.928
drawing all the incredible machines
he planned to build someday.

30:05.011 --> 30:07.180
[delicate, mournful music playing]

30:07.263 --> 30:09.849
Now the doctors,
they only gave him months to live.

30:11.100 --> 30:13.436
So he decided to design his own heart.

30:15.730 --> 30:18.733
So that his body
could keep up with his dazzling mind.

30:19.234 --> 30:20.235
[beating steadily]

30:22.320 --> 30:23.321
[beating halts]

30:29.077 --> 30:31.162
The operation was successful.

30:31.246 --> 30:33.748
But the clockwork heart
had changed the boy.

30:37.460 --> 30:38.461
He became cold,

30:39.420 --> 30:41.422
and driven by ambition.

30:49.973 --> 30:51.808
When he arrived at Nevermore,

30:51.891 --> 30:55.562
he was hailed as the greatest mind
to ever walk the halls.

30:55.645 --> 30:56.855
[electricity crackles]

30:57.605 --> 31:00.066
But his inventions became more dangerous.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.403
Until one night…

31:04.571 --> 31:08.116
his genius cost him his life.

31:12.412 --> 31:14.038
Now, legend has it,

31:14.914 --> 31:17.750
his body is buried
at the foot of the Skull Tree

31:17.834 --> 31:19.586
in an unmarked grave.

31:21.462 --> 31:24.257
But if you put your ear
to the skull's hollow left eye…

31:24.340 --> 31:25.592
[tick echoing]

31:26.175 --> 31:28.553
…you can still hear his clockwork heart.

31:29.971 --> 31:30.889
Tick,

31:31.598 --> 31:32.515
tick,

31:33.266 --> 31:34.267
tick.

31:35.602 --> 31:38.771
Only the bravest in Caliban Hall
have ventured out at night

31:38.855 --> 31:42.859
to take the dare to listen
to the tick of the clockwork heart.

31:45.194 --> 31:46.321
So will you?

32:01.127 --> 32:03.671
Miss Barclay, thanks for making the time.

32:03.755 --> 32:06.257
What a wonderful first day it's been,
hasn't it?

32:06.341 --> 32:09.844
Oh, it's so nice to see this place
brimming with Outcast energy.

32:11.554 --> 32:14.015
Our most famous alumni would be proud.

32:18.269 --> 32:19.354
I've been watching you.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.690
How you interacted with your peers.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.734
You know, charisma is something that…

32:24.817 --> 32:27.195
Well, it can't be learned. It's a gift.

32:27.278 --> 32:29.739
And you positively ooze it.

32:30.490 --> 32:33.785
I'm guessing you have
some political aspirations in your future?

32:34.369 --> 32:37.121
I like the idea of creating
real change for Outcasts.

32:37.622 --> 32:39.415
Well, what if I told you

32:39.499 --> 32:42.710
that you can start
creating that change today?

32:42.794 --> 32:45.838
As the fundraising gala's student liaison.

32:46.798 --> 32:49.884
We really need to heat things up
if we're going to hit our target.

32:49.968 --> 32:54.222
And you have the sizzle factor
I've been looking for.

32:54.305 --> 32:55.223
Uh…

32:55.306 --> 32:57.725
Wow. I'm honored.

32:58.309 --> 33:00.687
But I'm not sure I have time
to take on something like that.

33:01.521 --> 33:02.730
I'm really sorry.

33:05.525 --> 33:06.526
Me too.

33:07.652 --> 33:10.279
I mean, you are
a scholarship student, right?

33:10.363 --> 33:12.073
The school is in a financial pickle,

33:12.156 --> 33:14.826
and if we don't meet
our fundraising goals,

33:14.909 --> 33:19.205
I may be forced to let
some of the scholarship students go.

33:26.254 --> 33:28.840
I know how people feel about sirens.

33:29.590 --> 33:31.467
But I don't share that view.

33:32.218 --> 33:35.888
No Outcast should be limited or shamed.

33:35.972 --> 33:37.682
Is that why you're asking me?

33:38.266 --> 33:39.434
Because I'm a siren?

33:39.517 --> 33:43.604
Using your powers of persuasion
for a good cause should be applauded.

33:44.647 --> 33:46.065
I'm sure you agree.

33:47.191 --> 33:49.485
We all want what's best for Nevermore.

33:49.569 --> 33:52.155
So why don't you take another look
at that schedule of yours,

33:52.238 --> 33:53.990
and see if you can squeeze this in?

33:56.117 --> 33:58.453
You can give me your decision tomorrow.

34:12.008 --> 34:12.884
Thing!

34:13.426 --> 34:14.927
What are you doing out here?

34:16.012 --> 34:17.472
Wednesday yelled at you?

34:18.514 --> 34:21.851
[sighs] Man, the sudden popularity
is really getting to her.

34:21.934 --> 34:24.353
I think some people
just aren't built for fame.

34:24.437 --> 34:25.646
And when you're stressed,

34:25.730 --> 34:27.857
relatives can be
the easiest punching bags.

34:27.940 --> 34:29.692
Or in your case, sparring glove.

34:31.611 --> 34:33.821
I know how it feels
to think you don't belong.

34:33.905 --> 34:34.822
But you do.

34:36.199 --> 34:37.492
You know what you need?

34:37.575 --> 34:40.578
A place you can call your own.
And I've got the perfect spot.

37:19.987 --> 37:22.782
Miss Capri, the new head of music.

37:22.865 --> 37:24.367
Is this the same Isadora Capri

37:24.450 --> 37:27.828
who completed her first classical album
Wolf Howl at the age of ten?

37:27.912 --> 37:29.664
I didn't realize I had any fans left.

37:29.747 --> 37:32.083
I've always been fascinated
by child prodigies.

37:32.166 --> 37:35.294
The focus, the talent,
the unrelenting quest for excellence.

37:35.378 --> 37:38.214
Luckily, I was able to break free
before it suffocated me.

37:38.297 --> 37:40.675
I thought teaching
was the purview for those who can't.

37:42.134 --> 37:45.638
Well, I was inspired
by a group of young people

37:45.721 --> 37:48.224
who saved their school
in the face of overwhelming odds.

37:48.307 --> 37:51.560
I decided it was time
to give back to my own community.

37:54.855 --> 37:57.275
We have our work cut out for us.

-My hand's a little stiff.
-No, your hand wasn't the problem.

38:01.320 --> 38:04.407
Your pain was the only thing
that made your performance interesting.

38:05.032 --> 38:08.452
Did you know Prokofiev was a chess master?

38:08.536 --> 38:13.040
That's why his concertos
are so… deceptively cunning.

38:13.124 --> 38:16.419
He wants you to feel… the notes,

38:16.502 --> 38:18.796
not anticipate them.

38:18.879 --> 38:20.840
I'm not looking for lessons.

38:20.923 --> 38:22.800
I play for my own fulfillment.

38:22.883 --> 38:25.594
And yet music doesn't seem to fulfill you.

38:28.431 --> 38:30.266
Stop trying to control it.

38:31.309 --> 38:35.438
You have to succumb
to its… beautiful chaos.

38:35.521 --> 38:38.274
I cause chaos. I don't succumb to it.

since my days at Nevermore.

39:07.845 --> 39:11.849
Yes! It's a marvel what these
DaVinci students can build.

39:11.932 --> 39:14.977
They have more creativity
in their right pinkies

39:15.061 --> 39:17.229
than I have in my entire body.

39:21.609 --> 39:24.195
Mmm, Outcast can-do! Love it!

39:24.904 --> 39:26.947
This is why tradition is so important.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.908
It instills pride in our children.

39:28.991 --> 39:32.995

fitting into the Normie world.

39:36.999 --> 39:39.668
[Dort] Now, the Addams family is
a prime example

39:39.752 --> 39:42.213
of Outcasts who don't bend
to Normie culture.

39:42.296 --> 39:44.382
And that is a testament to you,
Mrs. Addams.

39:44.465 --> 39:45.549
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

39:46.759 --> 39:49.387
Have you made your decision
about chairing the gala yet?

39:50.054 --> 39:52.181
I'm… still pondering.

39:52.765 --> 39:55.768
I want to do what's best for Nevermore,
but also for my family.

39:55.851 --> 39:57.520
I understand. That is a lot to balance.

39:57.603 --> 40:00.773
Which is why you would have
a liaison student to assist you.

40:00.856 --> 40:03.275
And I am on the hunt
for that perfect person.
