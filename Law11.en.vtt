- Hello.
- Hello.

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:47.648
Hello, ma'am.

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:48.817

- Yes.

Being an Adult

00:02:35.364 --> 00:02:36.448
Geez.

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:47.709
Wait.

00:02:48.627 --> 00:02:50.128
When did they all become one firm?

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:56.509
Please leave, sir.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.052
- Gosh.
- Mr. Lee!

00:02:58.053 --> 00:03:00.096
Okay, goodbye.

00:03:00.097 --> 00:03:03.307
- I said I'll give you a piece of the land.
- Yes, if you get it.

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:05.017
Come back if you really get it.

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:06.727
You should head out for today.

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:08.270
- Let go of me!
- Goodbye!

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:09.939
I can let myself out!

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.942
For crying out loud!

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:15.194
My goodness.

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.989
You think smiling like a weasel
solves everything?

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.783
You don't even know what this is about.

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:23.245
Goodness. Geez!

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.330
Hello.

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:27.623
Attorney Cho.

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:29.835
Come to work earlier.
Why should I handle this stuff?

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:32.629
Damn it.

00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:39.635
Excuse me.

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:40.886
What was that about?

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:42.097
Well...

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.558
Yes, I understand what you're saying,

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:47.643
but we're so busy that we can't.

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:50.062
- Please try elsewhere.
- Come now.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:52.189
You're not the only lawyer here!

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.275
Just hand it off to another lawyer!

00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:57.736
- It's because we're a small firm.
- My goodness!

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:00.030
Even though I'm offering you
a piece of the land?

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:01.157
I'm so sorry.

00:04:01.158 --> 00:04:02.409
Geez!

00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:17.340
NOW SERVING

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:22.888
Hello. How can I help you?

00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:26.516
I'd like to get a replacement
for my old card.

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:28.559
While you're at it,

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.228
would you like to try
our newly launched debit card?

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.398
It's a great cashback card for savings,
so it's very popular.

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:36.066
Sure, I'll go with that one.

00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:38.444
Okay, please wait a moment
while we make your card.

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:39.529
Okay.

SHINHYUP SMALL BUSINESS SUPPORT PLAN

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.246
You have support programs
for small businesses too?

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:52.041
Yes, that's right.
We offer various services.

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:54.503
Like low-interest loans
and financial education.

00:04:56.213 --> 00:04:58.380
Okay. Here's your card.

00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:01.426
We'll also give you some stickers
to decorate it.

00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:03.970
They're cute. Thank you.

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:16.232
Attorney Kang.

00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:19.109
Seoul Central District Court
called to ask if you can take

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.028
a court-appointed case on May 12.

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:22.112
What should I tell them?

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:24.157
- Tell them I'm available.
- Okay.

00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:34.583
So your first court-appointed case?

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:36.086
Yeah, I'm finally doing one.

00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:38.337
What's the case?

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:40.130
I'm not sure yet.

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:42.384
They just checked
if I was available first.

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:45.303
Did your boss sign off on it?

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:49.265
I applied after getting
her approval before,

00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:51.934
but things got awkward
during that inheritance case.

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:53.186
I might check with her again.

00:05:54.855 --> 00:05:57.941
Hey, did you also have
that weird old man visit this morning?

00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:02.611
He visited you too? I heard he had
some weird paper with Chinese characters,

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:05.155
saying acres of land
were his or something.

00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:08.450
Yeah. It looked like a document
from the National Archives.

00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:10.703
As if you've ever been there before.

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:12.872
- Have you?
- Of course, I have.

00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:14.915
I once had a case
involving a national honoree.

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:17.085
Well, I heard from my boss earlier.

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.129
And it sounds like
he's been around everywhere.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.299
He said he couldn't pay the retainer.

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:24.884
Our firm probably turned him away.

00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:26.051
Most likely.

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:28.972
I bet your boss
would've taken him in though.

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:32.474
My boss isn't that much
of a pushover either.

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:34.019
- I see.
- I see.

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:41.901
Come on. Lunchtime's not even over yet.

00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:44.695
- What is it?
- Our boss called, so we have to go.

00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:46.071
I'll clean up. Go ahead.

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:47.324
Thanks. Let's go.

00:06:47.908 --> 00:06:48.909
Bye.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.703
Let's go to a cafe. I need some caffeine.

00:06:52.704 --> 00:06:55.999
- No, I have to go too. I'm busy.
- Come on.

00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.836
I can't go either.

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:03.006
- Want this instead?
- Okay.

00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:06.801
- Want one too, Sanggi?
- Thank you.

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:08.678
Here.

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:10.555
What a lifesaver.

00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:19.438
Hey, clean up before you leave!

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.691
I'd like you two to handle
this real estate case.

00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:25.986
- We're taking that old man's case?
- You know about it?

00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:28.406
Yes, we heard from the other attorneys.

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:32.660
It's not like you
to take on a case like this.

00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:34.078
What kind of case is this?

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:35.872
I heard they can't pay the retainer.

00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:40.251
If we win the land back for him,
we'll get a share of it.

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:42.711
It's a pretty big area.

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:45.715
In return, we're covering
all of the legal costs.

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:48.426
But if things work out, it's a jackpot.

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:50.679
I'll be counting on you.

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:57.059
This is it?

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.353
Yes, that's all he had.

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:01.314
What are we supposed to do with just this?

00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:04.150
Are you really going to do
something like this?

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:10.115
What's with everyone lately?

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.534
So many complaints.

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:16.204
Let's just stick
to how we've always done things.

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:20.417
Okay?

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:31.469
Yes, Attorney Kang? What is it?

00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:34.806
Ma'am.

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:39.561
I just got word I'm going to be assigned
a court-appointed case.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.770
Is it okay if I take it?

00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:43.147
Of course.

00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:44.941
There's no need to ask about that.

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:47.569
I just wanted to double-check.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:51.531
I told you before it was fine.

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:56.161
Right, thank you.

00:08:58.413 --> 00:09:01.915
Please set up a system
where new case assignments

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:04.586
can be logged and shared
right away by each firm.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.838
That way, they can avoid
ending up on the same case.

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:09.466
Also,

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:12.509
let's get a dedicated tax accountant
for each floor,

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.345
so they can manage their own books.

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:17.557
Chairman, will you still be
working from here?

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:21.643
It must be tough to go back and forth
from the foundation. I'm sorry.

00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:24.021
Not at all. I'm fine with it.

00:09:24.022 --> 00:09:27.233
But a few people are saying
you're only focused on this place.

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:30.445
Both from the foundation and the company.

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:35.950
The staff and the directors
have done such a great job,

00:09:36.618 --> 00:09:38.119
so I've been really thankful.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.371
But I guess I've been neglectful.

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:44.417
Thank you for telling me.
I'll try to pay more attention to them.

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:46.085
Well...

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:49.672
This law group is neither a charity
nor a business.

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:53.718
Do you mind if I ask
why you're so invested in it?

00:10:32.924 --> 00:10:34.884
Yes, that's great.

00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:37.970
Then, I'll do these two.

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:39.847
- Could you take care of the rest?
- Okay.

00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:42.182
And one more case just came in.

00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:44.268
It seems like
a real estate contract issue.

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:46.270
The client's young.
Could you do a consult?

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:47.730
Yes, ma'am.

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:49.315
And...

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.860
Have you thought about what I gave you?

00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:54.112
The PhD program.

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:57.866
Yes, about that...

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:02.495
I appreciate you looking out for me,
but I've decided not to do it.

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:04.497
Why?

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:07.959
They won't accept me
if I work and study at the same time.

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:09.918
The school said that?

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:11.087
Yes.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.214
I mean, I have to stay here and work.

00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:16.216
I can't just go and leave you behind.

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:19.303
I am going to return to my office
and get some work done.

00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:20.638
All right.

00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:29.414
If you're a lawyer,
you can't just be sitting around all day.

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:31.500
You have to go out and hit the streets.

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:34.337
Or at least listen carefully
to what people have to say.

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:39.841
So you're saying this land
was taken by others

00:12:39.842 --> 00:12:42.386
after Korea was liberated
and the Korean War, right?

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:43.638
That's right.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.348
Suddenly after the war,

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:50.520
the land ended up
in the hands of the Kwak family.

00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:53.856
But with this one document,
there's not much we can verify.

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:56.233
If not one, then what?

00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:58.110
Would two make a difference?

00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:00.821
There was only ever one to begin with.

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:04.074
It's the lawyers' job to dig up the rest.

00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:05.993
All right, now.

00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:07.829
Look here. Okay?

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:10.498 line:20%
"Doheung-myeon."

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:12.958
Now, it's Doheung-eup. Okay?

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.210
"Lot 580."

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:16.003
Yeah. Here.

00:13:16.004 --> 00:13:21.676
That's around 32 acres.

00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:24.469
"<i>Taisho</i> 3."

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:28.140
<i>Taisho</i> is an era name
from the Japanese occupation period.

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:29.225
And here!

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:32.520
- Han Insu...
- We know what it says.

00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:36.940
But we're saying we can't tell
what happened just from looking at this.

00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:39.360
This lot number
doesn't even exist anymore.

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:43.156
What is your relation to Han Insu?

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:46.283
We're family.

00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:48.201
So how exactly are you related?

00:13:48.202 --> 00:13:51.122
We're more like family than family.

00:13:51.789 --> 00:13:53.416
Family isn't just about blood.

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:56.753
- So you're not related at all?
- Come now.

00:13:57.336 --> 00:13:59.838
Look at this. I'll show you.

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:03.550
Getting this land back isn't about me.
Look at this.

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:06.094
These are Han Insu's great-grandchildren.

00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:07.388
HAN SUCHEOL
HAN SUKJA

00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:12.185
Then, you're not related at all.
Why are you trying to reclaim it?

00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:17.898
Everyone in the neighborhood knows

00:14:17.899 --> 00:14:20.151
that land belonged to Han Insu!

00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:22.487
But they're all keeping quiet.

00:14:23.112 --> 00:14:27.408
Why? Because all the elders
in Han's family have passed away.

00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:32.496
Come with me.
You'll understand once you see.

00:14:32.497 --> 00:14:34.832
- We don't need to go there--
- Let's go.

00:14:36.084 --> 00:14:38.001
What? Really?

00:14:38.002 --> 00:14:41.464
Sure. Let's go. Get up. Come on!

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:46.511
You're really going?

00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:49.471
We need to check
if that power of attorney is legit.

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:50.555
Let's go.

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:52.015
POWER OF ATTORNEY
PARK MANSU

00:14:52.016 --> 00:14:54.101
AUTHORIZING THE ABOVE TO APPOINT A LAWYER

00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:56.228
TO RECOVER THIS LAND

00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:58.439
GRANTORS
HAN SUCHEOL, HAN SUKJA, HAN SUCHAN

00:15:01.442 --> 00:15:04.986
So, I trusted the realtor
and signed the lease.

00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:08.699
But now, the landlord's saying they never
agreed to such a thing and want me out.

00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:11.827
- And you've never met the landlord?
- No.

00:15:11.828 --> 00:15:15.914
The realtor said they were authorized
to act on the landlord's behalf

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:18.000
and showed me
their power of attorney document.

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:21.420
The power of attorney...

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:25.925
- But it's not included in these documents.
- Well...

00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:29.262
They said they could only show it
and not give me a copy.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.888
No.

00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:33.431
If you don't meet the landlord,

00:15:33.432 --> 00:15:35.768
you must receive
their power of attorney document.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.521
Then...

00:15:39.522 --> 00:15:41.232
I messed that up too.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.068
Did you sign the lease by yourself?

00:15:46.195 --> 00:15:48.489
I grew up in an orphanage.

00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:51.701
I barely got that place
with my self-reliance grant.

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:54.370
I didn't have anyone I could ask.

00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:00.167
It's okay. This isn't your fault.

00:16:00.168 --> 00:16:02.211
These people are the ones
who did something bad.

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:03.879
Yes.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.214
Well, in any case,

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:07.174
it sounds like the realtor

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:10.093
signed off on this contract on their own
and stole the deposit.

00:16:10.094 --> 00:16:13.180
I mean, I was living there
and everything was fine.

00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:16.017
And then, out of nowhere,
I get an eviction notice.

00:16:16.684 --> 00:16:18.102
It's all so overwhelming.

00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:20.688
I don't even have anywhere else to go.

00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:24.149
It's okay. All right, Yunsu.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.985
You know the location
of this real estate office, right?

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:29.697
BLUE HOUSE REAL ESTATE

00:16:31.073 --> 00:16:32.574
That wasn't me.

00:16:32.575 --> 00:16:35.452
He used to be one of my employees,

00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:37.955
but even I don't know where he is now.

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:41.292
Come on, you tell him.
You know I didn't do it.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:50.175
Well, even if it wasn't you,
your employee did it.

00:16:50.176 --> 00:16:52.803
So you're still legally responsible
as their employer.

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:55.598
I'll take responsibility if I need to.

00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:57.099
Go ahead and sue.

00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:02.229
Have you worked
with the landlord for a long time?

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.022
I heard they own the whole building.

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:05.941
Yes, we worked together for a while.

00:17:05.942 --> 00:17:08.319
But due to this, our partnership ended.

00:17:09.612 --> 00:17:12.614
Is he someone who'd be willing
to show some understanding?

00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:15.409
No way. He's as cold as ice.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:20.705
Right, that employee you mentioned.

00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:22.041
He apparently showed

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:24.919
Mr. Yunsu a power of attorney.
What was that?

00:17:27.713 --> 00:17:29.465
There probably wasn't one.

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:38.307
BLUE HOUSE REAL ESTATE

00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:48.150
Why is this only happening to me?

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.861
Don't think that way.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:56.075
I should've looked into it more.
That's on me. I know that.

00:17:57.201 --> 00:18:00.413
But everyone else in the building
signed through this agency too.

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:04.083
Everyone else signed just fine
and had no issues.

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:06.294
So why is it just me?

00:18:14.677 --> 00:18:16.344
It was just bad luck.

00:18:16.345 --> 00:18:17.555
That's all it is.

00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:43.372
COMPLAINT
REAL ESTATE REPOSSESSION

00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:46.709
LANDLORD
HEO SIWON

00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:50.588 line:20%
DEFENDANT'S CLAIM OF LEASE AGREEMENT

00:18:59.513 --> 00:19:04.143
All of them went through the same agency,
but they didn't have any problems.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.128
"Article 129."

00:19:32.129 --> 00:19:33.963
They said this area

00:19:33.964 --> 00:19:37.676
is about to be designated
an industrial park or something,

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:39.886
so the value of the land has shot way up.

00:19:39.887 --> 00:19:40.970
Okay?

00:19:40.971 --> 00:19:42.889
They wanted to forget and move on,

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:46.393
but when I heard that, I got so fired up!

00:19:46.394 --> 00:19:48.353
I couldn't sit still.

00:19:48.354 --> 00:19:51.398
- All this used to belong to one person?
- Yes.

00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:55.110
The Kwak family took it
and carved it all up for themselves.

00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:57.697
Even the government took a piece too.

00:19:58.489 --> 00:20:00.700
- What about beyond that stream?
- What?

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.702
No, that's not part of it.

00:20:03.452 --> 00:20:04.620
We have to hurry.

00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:06.747
I'm already 80,

00:20:07.373 --> 00:20:11.085
and Han Insu's great-grandchildren
aren't exactly young either.

00:20:12.086 --> 00:20:13.504
Why haven't they intervened?

00:20:15.464 --> 00:20:18.591
All the elders in their family
passed away early.

00:20:18.592 --> 00:20:21.094
They've had hard lives
since they were kids.

00:20:21.095 --> 00:20:23.138
They're still on welfare right now.

00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:24.931
They're busy trying
to get by each day,

00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:26.809
so they can't even dare to do this.

00:20:27.393 --> 00:20:29.186
You said they still live here, right?

00:20:30.646 --> 00:20:31.939
- The great-grandchildren?
- Yes.

00:20:32.523 --> 00:20:33.649
Can we meet them?

00:20:35.776 --> 00:20:37.277
There's one.

00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:38.362
Hey!

00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:40.823
- Hello!
- Hey!

00:20:42.366 --> 00:20:45.869
Thank you so much
for coming out here in person.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.620
Come now.

00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:51.624
I said you had to go and see it
for yourself to understand,

00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:52.835
so what could they do?

00:20:54.962 --> 00:20:57.798
I thought if I didn't settle this
before I die,

00:20:58.466 --> 00:20:59.841
I'd never be at peace.

00:20:59.842 --> 00:21:03.261
Goodness, you need to live a long life.
Don't say that, sir.

00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:06.598
If he weren't around in our town,
nothing would get done.

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:07.975
Come on.

00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:15.356
Hurry and follow me. We're not done yet.

00:21:15.357 --> 00:21:16.442
Take care.

00:21:42.718 --> 00:21:43.843
Okay.

00:21:43.844 --> 00:21:46.679
Take this with you, okay?

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.847
HAN INSU

00:21:47.848 --> 00:21:49.225
And...

00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:50.810
Let's see.

00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:52.937
Here. Okay.

00:21:53.687 --> 00:21:54.897
This one too.

00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:57.191
Take a look at it, okay?

00:21:57.983 --> 00:21:58.984
My goodness.

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:02.737
I'm sure it's here.

00:22:02.738 --> 00:22:04.614
Here it is.

00:22:04.615 --> 00:22:08.828 line:20%
This is the complaint I filed
at the town office.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:13.122
And this was the story
that was in the local newspaper.

00:22:13.123 --> 00:22:14.791
Okay? All right.

00:22:14.792 --> 00:22:17.253
What do you think we can do with these?

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.380
Come now.

00:22:19.964 --> 00:22:22.883
You need to figure that out.
I'm not the lawyer here!

00:22:27.304 --> 00:22:28.764
But with these,

00:22:29.431 --> 00:22:32.350
there's not much we can do.

00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:33.435
Goodness.

00:22:34.103 --> 00:22:39.942
That's why we need you
as the lawyers to handle that.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:51.370
He wasn't a scammer.

00:22:52.329 --> 00:22:53.956
The power of attorney was legit too.

00:23:00.004 --> 00:23:02.464
At the end of the day,
this document is the issue.

00:23:08.304 --> 00:23:09.554
What are you going to do?

00:23:09.555 --> 00:23:10.973
We have to find something.

00:23:19.857 --> 00:23:22.776
First, let's review
all the footage we took...

00:23:25.404 --> 00:23:26.905
and compare it with the map.

00:23:26.906 --> 00:23:29.074
- Okay.
- Let's look closely at the land's shape.

00:23:34.121 --> 00:23:36.956
- The shape of the stream...
- Yeah, the boundary lines are here too.

00:23:36.957 --> 00:23:40.169
Lot 580...

00:23:40.878 --> 00:23:42.379
We need to find it.

00:23:52.139 --> 00:23:57.311
It's 102,882.7 square meters.

00:23:57.811 --> 00:23:59.855
So it's about 25 acres.

00:24:08.614 --> 00:24:09.698
Twenty-five...

00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:13.368
It doesn't add up?

00:24:13.369 --> 00:24:14.452
No.

00:24:14.453 --> 00:24:15.537
Damn it.

00:24:16.038 --> 00:24:18.040
He was full of nonsense all along.

00:24:22.044 --> 00:24:24.630
Either the old man was mistaken or lying.

00:24:36.934 --> 00:24:38.268
ATTORNEY BAE MUNJEONG

00:24:45.359 --> 00:24:46.735
Hi. What's up?

00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:49.029
Hey, Munjeong.

00:24:50.322 --> 00:24:54.159
Have you thought about
working in-house again by any chance?

00:24:54.743 --> 00:24:55.743
What?

00:24:55.744 --> 00:24:59.455
<i>It seemed like you were interested
in my company last time.</i>

00:24:59.456 --> 00:25:02.292
Well, there's an opening now,

00:25:02.876 --> 00:25:04.795
<i>so I thought of you and called.</i>

00:25:05.504 --> 00:25:06.839
Really?

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.843
<i>Maybe I read that wrong.</i>

00:25:11.468 --> 00:25:12.469
No, not at all.

00:25:13.053 --> 00:25:17.306
- Can I think it over and call you back?
<i>- Of course.</i>

00:25:17.307 --> 00:25:20.101
My gosh! You're going to get
your legs caught! Be careful!

00:25:20.102 --> 00:25:21.394
Sorry about that.

00:25:21.395 --> 00:25:25.106
Okay. So, the job posting will go up soon.

00:25:25.107 --> 00:25:29.027
I'll send you the details in advance.
Let me know once you've seen them.

00:25:29.028 --> 00:25:31.488
Okay. Thanks, Jeongin.

Attorney Kang.

00:25:50.841 --> 00:25:54.177
The court-appointed case decision came in.
I left it on your desk.

00:25:54.178 --> 00:25:56.388
It's here? Thank you.

- Attorney Ha.
- Hi.

00:27:40.033 --> 00:27:41.158
You were already here.

00:27:41.159 --> 00:27:42.244
- Let's go in.
- Okay.

00:27:55.757 --> 00:27:57.466
- Who is it?
- Hello.

00:27:57.467 --> 00:27:58.635
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:27:59.761 --> 00:28:00.761
Hello.

00:28:00.762 --> 00:28:04.015
I'm Attorney Ha Sanggi
with Law Group Hyungmin.

00:28:04.016 --> 00:28:08.227
We're having some issues
with this building's lease contract,

00:28:08.228 --> 00:28:10.021
so we'd like to ask for your help.

00:28:10.022 --> 00:28:13.065
- Do you happen to have your contract?
- What about it?

00:28:13.066 --> 00:28:14.650
- Could we take a photo?
- No.

00:28:14.651 --> 00:28:16.611
- We'd appreciate it.
- Please leave. You can't.

00:28:16.612 --> 00:28:17.779
No, just the contract...

00:28:19.448 --> 00:28:20.865
- The contract?
- Yes.

00:28:20.866 --> 00:28:22.742
There won't be any legal issues.

00:28:22.743 --> 00:28:24.786
We only need it as a reference.

00:28:27.915 --> 00:28:28.998
- All right, here.
- Thank you.

00:28:28.999 --> 00:28:31.042
If you get worried,
you can give me a call.

00:28:31.043 --> 00:28:32.501
- Okay.
- Thank you so much.

00:28:32.502 --> 00:28:33.879
Thank you.

00:28:37.841 --> 00:28:39.176
Gosh, which floor is this?

00:28:42.512 --> 00:28:45.807
You should've told me
there was no elevator.

00:28:47.309 --> 00:28:49.061
STANDARD RENTAL AGREEMENT

00:28:55.776 --> 00:28:57.110 line:20%
POWER OF ATTORNEY

00:29:02.908 --> 00:29:05.911
You said you were never given
power of attorney by the landlord.

00:29:06.495 --> 00:29:08.371
There wasn't a single unit we checked

00:29:08.372 --> 00:29:10.248
that didn't have one.

00:29:12.084 --> 00:29:14.044
I didn't say we never had
power of attorney.

00:29:16.088 --> 00:29:20.759
I said there probably wasn't one
when this young man signed his lease.

00:29:22.177 --> 00:29:24.261
Now, at the time,
we had it.

00:29:24.262 --> 00:29:26.681
We received power of attorney
from the landlord

00:29:26.682 --> 00:29:28.766
and handled leases on their behalf then.

00:29:28.767 --> 00:29:31.435
And then, he told us
that wouldn't happen anymore

00:29:31.436 --> 00:29:33.396
and to just handle the brokering.

00:29:33.397 --> 00:29:35.106
So we threw all of them out.

00:29:35.107 --> 00:29:37.817
Then, you should've also
said that back then.

00:29:37.818 --> 00:29:40.194
Come on, you didn't ask
for that much detail.

00:29:40.195 --> 00:29:41.905
It's not like I lied.

00:29:45.033 --> 00:29:47.369
Then, out of all these leased units,

00:29:47.953 --> 00:29:51.248
how many were signed after the landlord
revoked the power of attorney?

00:29:55.585 --> 00:29:58.171
Power of attorney...

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:04.261
Just one.

00:30:05.846 --> 00:30:07.931
- Just one?
- Just me?

00:30:09.224 --> 00:30:12.643
We handled all the leases
on the landlord's behalf up until then.

00:30:12.644 --> 00:30:15.938
But once the landlord said
he wanted that to stop,

00:30:15.939 --> 00:30:17.189
what were we supposed to do?

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:19.109
That's his call.

00:30:19.735 --> 00:30:23.112
And it just so happened
the first lease after the change was his.

00:30:23.113 --> 00:30:25.823
That employee acted like
we still had authority to sign leases

00:30:25.824 --> 00:30:28.535
and ran off after scamming him.

00:30:36.793 --> 00:30:40.297
I guess I really do have rotten luck.

00:30:41.757 --> 00:30:44.217
- Of all people, it had to be me.
- No.

00:30:49.723 --> 00:30:53.059
You actually might've become really lucky.

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.186
Yeah.

00:30:57.522 --> 00:31:00.150
Wait, how do they not add up?

00:31:00.692 --> 00:31:02.985
Did you calculate the numbers right?
Did you?

00:31:02.986 --> 00:31:06.948
I mean, you can't even
work out the area properly?

00:31:08.366 --> 00:31:09.534
My goodness.

00:31:10.619 --> 00:31:15.373
Maybe they measured land differently
back in the Japanese occupation days.

00:31:15.916 --> 00:31:18.042
I checked, but it wasn't different.

00:31:18.043 --> 00:31:19.752
Do you have the original copy?

00:31:19.753 --> 00:31:21.337
My goodness.

00:31:21.338 --> 00:31:24.507
Let's say this paper's wrong.

00:31:24.508 --> 00:31:28.803
But everyone in our town
has known for generations

00:31:28.804 --> 00:31:31.013
that the land belongs to that family.

00:31:31.014 --> 00:31:36.102
The only things we could call evidence is
this single sheet of paper and your words.

00:31:36.103 --> 00:31:37.729
But even those don't line up.

00:31:38.355 --> 00:31:41.982
So you're saying that I'm lying?

00:31:41.983 --> 00:31:43.819
Forget it. I'll find someone else.

00:31:44.653 --> 00:31:45.987
Why are you going this far?

00:31:50.033 --> 00:31:51.034
What do you mean?

00:31:52.077 --> 00:31:53.787
You said this wasn't your land.

00:31:54.746 --> 00:31:56.498
You really don't gain anything from this?

00:31:59.167 --> 00:32:02.254
Do you only do things for your gain?

00:32:04.506 --> 00:32:06.049
If I don't do this, who will?

00:32:06.633 --> 00:32:10.053
Someone's got to do it,
so that's why I'm doing it.

00:32:10.804 --> 00:32:13.181
Forget it. That's all for today.

00:32:14.391 --> 00:32:15.392
Thanks for your work.

00:32:34.661 --> 00:32:36.287
Wait, so what happened?

00:32:36.288 --> 00:32:38.706
The old man just left after that?

00:32:38.707 --> 00:32:41.041
Yeah. He probably went
to find another firm.

00:32:41.042 --> 00:32:43.295
See? I told you
he seemed off to begin with.

00:32:44.296 --> 00:32:46.423
Or he could've been just mistaken.

00:32:49.593 --> 00:32:50.886
Let's eat.

00:32:51.928 --> 00:32:53.847
Since I'm pregnant,
I'll help myself first.

00:33:06.318 --> 00:33:08.944
Did you receive the decision
on your court-appointed case yet?

00:33:08.945 --> 00:33:11.448
I did, but it's a murder case.

00:33:13.575 --> 00:33:15.034
- What?
- Goodness.

00:33:15.035 --> 00:33:17.077
Have you all had murder cases before?

00:33:17.078 --> 00:33:18.495
Yeah, I have.

00:33:18.496 --> 00:33:21.416
I had one before, but my client
was definitely a bad guy.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:23.710
Is it a really brutal case?

00:33:24.711 --> 00:33:25.961
I'm not sure.

00:33:25.962 --> 00:33:29.257
In a way,
it might be the most brutal case,

00:33:30.008 --> 00:33:31.509
but it also might be not.

00:33:33.929 --> 00:33:37.307
She killed the sibling
she'd taken care of for over 10 years.

00:33:41.353 --> 00:33:43.270
Things must've been awful
for her to do that.

00:33:43.271 --> 00:33:45.106
Hey, someone died...

00:33:45.732 --> 00:33:48.568
I honestly don't know
how I should feel about this case either.

00:33:49.653 --> 00:33:52.155
I'm not sure
if I'll ever fully understand my client.

00:33:56.368 --> 00:33:57.409
Eat first.

00:33:57.410 --> 00:33:58.995
- Eat up.
- Yeah.

00:34:11.591 --> 00:34:13.425
When doing court-appointed cases,

00:34:13.426 --> 00:34:15.804
there are always ones
that weigh on your mind.

00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:18.139
It's normal to feel conflicted.

00:34:19.516 --> 00:34:21.725
I thought you'd tell me
not to get emotional

00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:22.936
and that it was just work.

00:34:24.312 --> 00:34:26.231
Of course, it's better not to.

00:34:26.898 --> 00:34:28.483
But you can't help it.

00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:40.620
Do you feel bad for the old man?

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:45.417
I guess I wanted to believe him.

00:34:47.043 --> 00:34:49.754
I wanted Mr. Park Mansu
to be telling the truth.

00:34:50.755 --> 00:34:52.674
Even the part
about doing it out of goodwill.

00:34:54.259 --> 00:34:55.260
It's a shame.

00:34:58.805 --> 00:35:01.141
Have you noticed
you've changed recently?

00:35:04.853 --> 00:35:05.854
Thanks to you.

00:35:32.047 --> 00:35:34.006

STATUS
IN CUSTODY

00:35:51.024 --> 00:35:52.025
Ms. Han.

00:35:52.859 --> 00:35:55.903
Could you make a copy
of Ms. Jeong Sunja's case file

00:35:55.904 --> 00:35:58.657
- and submit a request for visitation?
- Yes, of course.

00:36:01.743 --> 00:36:03.828
Could you pull up
defendant's Exhibit 5, please?

00:36:06.706 --> 00:36:07.706
STANDARD RENTAL AGREEMENT

00:36:07.707 --> 00:36:12.252
These are the contracts signed by tenants
living in the plaintiff's building.

00:36:12.253 --> 00:36:13.712
As you can see,

00:36:13.713 --> 00:36:17.007
every one of these leases
was signed through the real estate office.

00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:19.177
Could you pull up
defendant's Exhibit 6, please?

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:22.930
Thank you.

00:36:22.931 --> 00:36:24.015
POWER OF ATTORNEY

00:36:26.851 --> 00:36:28.686
GRANTOR
HEO SIWON

00:36:28.687 --> 00:36:31.939
As you can see,
only the date section was left blank

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:34.234
and was later filled in by hand.

00:36:34.943 --> 00:36:36.402
This was the case for all of them.

00:36:36.403 --> 00:36:38.570
The plaintiff gave

00:36:38.571 --> 00:36:42.449
dozens of POA documents stamped
with his seal to the real estate office

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:45.411
and told them to fill in the dates
and use as needed.

00:36:45.412 --> 00:36:48.706
Even after ending
their business relationship,

00:36:48.707 --> 00:36:51.458
the plaintiff did not take back
the rest of those documents.

00:36:51.459 --> 00:36:55.462
So the defendant saw
one of those stamped documents

00:36:55.463 --> 00:36:58.967
and believed the realtor
still had power of attorney.

00:36:59.634 --> 00:37:01.552
Since the plaintiff
is partly responsible

00:37:01.553 --> 00:37:03.178
for the defendant's misunderstanding,

00:37:03.179 --> 00:37:05.723
according to Civil Act, Article 129,

00:37:05.724 --> 00:37:08.727
the defendant's lease
should be carried out as normal.

00:37:09.769 --> 00:37:10.894
Plaintiff's counsel,

00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:13.564
is it true the landlord
didn't take back those documents?

00:37:13.565 --> 00:37:15.774
He heard the realtor
had destroyed all of them.

00:37:15.775 --> 00:37:18.902
So he heard
but didn't personally take them back?

00:37:18.903 --> 00:37:20.904
Yes, Your Honor.
That is my understanding.

00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:22.407
Here's what we'll do.

00:37:23.324 --> 00:37:26.952 line:20%
I'm issuing a settlement recommendation.

00:37:26.953 --> 00:37:29.038 line:20%
Let's have the plaintiff
withdraw the lawsuit,

00:37:29.539 --> 00:37:34.418 line:20%
and I'll send out the official decision
to have the lease agreement carried out.

00:37:34.419 --> 00:37:37.589
Counsel, meet with the plaintiff
and try to convince him.

00:37:38.673 --> 00:37:40.133
The plaintiff is a victim too.

00:37:41.509 --> 00:37:43.093
And so is the defendant.

00:37:43.094 --> 00:37:45.637
If the plaintiff played a part
in causing this situation,

00:37:45.638 --> 00:37:48.850 line:20%
then Civil Act Article 129 says
he bears responsibility.

00:37:49.434 --> 00:37:50.477 line:20%
Yes, Your Honor.

00:37:51.186 --> 00:37:52.644 line:20%
- Defense counsel.
- Yes, Your Honor?

00:37:52.645 --> 00:37:55.689
You understand that if we go
with a settlement recommendation,

00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:59.568
each party will cover
their own legal fees?

00:37:59.569 --> 00:38:01.737
- Yes, Your Honor.
- The plaintiff can't be ordered

00:38:01.738 --> 00:38:03.989
to pay the defendant's fees.

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:05.492
Are you okay with that?

00:38:08.369 --> 00:38:10.162
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Okay.

00:38:10.163 --> 00:38:13.624
Then, I'll issue the decision
on the settlement recommendation.

00:38:13.625 --> 00:38:16.668
If there are no objections
within two weeks, it'll be finalized.

00:38:16.669 --> 00:38:17.753
Thank you, everyone.

00:38:17.754 --> 00:38:20.381
Let's move on to the next case.

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.195
Attorney Ha.

00:38:45.073 --> 00:38:46.074
Thank you.

00:38:46.658 --> 00:38:49.577
Thank you so much, Attorney Ha.

00:38:50.703 --> 00:38:53.247
You're very lucky. I told you.

00:38:53.248 --> 00:38:55.041
You're a very lucky person, Yunsu.

00:38:58.294 --> 00:38:59.712
Thank you, Attorney Ha.

00:39:02.632 --> 00:39:04.968
Aren't you hungry?
Do you want to go get some food?

00:39:07.053 --> 00:39:08.054
Let's go.

00:39:16.187 --> 00:39:17.856
Slowly. Okay.

00:39:31.911 --> 00:39:32.996
Attorney Ha.

00:39:34.497 --> 00:39:35.915
You're so cool.

00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:38.250
Sorry?

00:39:38.251 --> 00:39:40.003
You took care of everything.

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:44.799
I want to go to college too
and become just like you.

00:39:45.842 --> 00:39:48.719
Then, are you studying right now?

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:51.264
Yes, I've been preparing
for the college entrance exam.

00:39:53.016 --> 00:39:54.141
But I may have to stop now.

00:39:54.142 --> 00:39:55.268
Why?

00:39:56.311 --> 00:39:58.313
Well, I need to make money.

00:39:59.314 --> 00:40:02.525
I have a younger sibling
who's about to age out of the orphanage.

00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:04.819
I'll have to take care of them.

00:40:06.404 --> 00:40:08.239
My situation may not allow me to study.

00:40:17.582 --> 00:40:18.583
Well...

00:40:20.335 --> 00:40:22.003
Even if you can't right now,

00:40:23.546 --> 00:40:27.008
don't give up on your dream completely.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:32.305
These are all cooked.

00:40:40.521 --> 00:40:41.522
Thank you.

00:40:48.529 --> 00:40:51.658
Can you check if we still have
that scholarship certificate?

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:53.451
Yeah.

00:40:54.369 --> 00:40:56.329
No, it's probably with you.

00:40:57.747 --> 00:41:00.583
No, there's just someone
I want to connect the scholarship with.

00:41:01.334 --> 00:41:04.045
Okay. All right, bye.

00:41:26.693 --> 00:41:28.610
- Have you thought it over?
- About what?

00:41:28.611 --> 00:41:30.028
Joining the company.

00:41:30.029 --> 00:41:32.114
I'm not doing it. It's not for me.

00:41:32.115 --> 00:41:33.573
And being a lawyer is?

00:41:33.574 --> 00:41:36.118
Even if I quit law,
I'm not going into business.

00:41:36.119 --> 00:41:39.496
If I'd been interested,
I would've joined from the start.

00:41:39.497 --> 00:41:42.709
It's not like I got into business
because I loved it.

00:41:43.334 --> 00:41:46.086
You're drawn to
what suits you as you go.

00:41:46.087 --> 00:41:48.755
I didn't start law
because I loved it either.

00:41:48.756 --> 00:41:51.717
But I'll figure out what suits me as I go.

00:41:51.718 --> 00:41:53.010
You stubborn kid.

00:41:53.011 --> 00:41:55.054
You get that from me, you know.

00:41:55.555 --> 00:41:56.680
I know.

00:41:56.681 --> 00:41:58.641
That's why you'd do well in business.

00:41:59.726 --> 00:42:00.727
For goodness' sake.

00:42:02.562 --> 00:42:04.730
- I have plans too.
- What plans?

00:42:04.731 --> 00:42:06.231
Just wait.

00:42:06.232 --> 00:42:07.900
I have something I'm working on.

00:42:11.487 --> 00:42:14.449
MATERIALS TO PREPARE FOR PROSECUTOR EXAM

00:42:24.333 --> 00:42:25.709
<i>What about beyond that stream?</i>

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:27.378
No, that's not part of it.

00:42:33.676 --> 00:42:36.053
<i>He was full of nonsense all along.</i>

00:42:36.054 --> 00:42:38.972
<i>Either the old man was mistaken or lying.</i>

00:42:38.973 --> 00:42:42.225
If he wasn't around in our town,
nothing would get done.

00:42:42.226 --> 00:42:44.520
Come on.

00:42:46.564 --> 00:42:49.233
Do you feel bad for the old man?

00:42:49.984 --> 00:42:52.862
<i>I wanted Mr. Park Mansu
to be telling the truth.</i>

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.739
<i>Even the part
about doing it out of goodwill.</i>

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:58.826
Do you only do things for your gain?

00:43:00.328 --> 00:43:01.829
If I don't do this, who will?

00:43:02.955 --> 00:43:06.125
Someone's got to do it,
so that's why I'm doing it.

00:43:14.467 --> 00:43:16.761
<i>It looked like a document
from the National Archives.</i>

00:43:18.096 --> 00:43:19.763
As if you've ever been there before.

00:43:19.764 --> 00:43:21.389
- Have you?
- Of course, I have.

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:24.644
I once had a case
involving a national honoree.

00:43:37.615 --> 00:43:39.866
We can access
the National Archives these days, right?

00:43:39.867 --> 00:43:41.118
What?

00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:42.202
LOCATION NAME SEARCH

00:43:42.203 --> 00:43:45.206
"580 Dongjan-ri."

00:43:45.873 --> 00:43:46.873
Here.

00:43:46.874 --> 00:43:49.752
- Click on the one that says "Han Insu."
- Okay.

00:43:51.546 --> 00:43:54.715
Let's pull everything
with the name "Han Insu" on it.

00:43:55.883 --> 00:43:57.468
Yeah, okay.

00:43:59.137 --> 00:44:01.806
Back then, Lot 580 was
one large piece of land.

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:05.184
But it looks different
from how Mr. Park described it.

00:44:24.704 --> 00:44:26.789
- This part?
- Right?

00:44:37.216 --> 00:44:39.093
I'll print out
land registers for these areas.

00:44:46.893 --> 00:44:48.060
Eighty-four...

00:44:52.648 --> 00:44:53.649
Three-hundred eighty-four...

00:44:57.987 --> 00:44:59.655
One hundred and thirty...

00:45:08.414 --> 00:45:12.752
That's 130,757.1.

00:45:13.419 --> 00:45:14.503
And in acres...

00:45:15.463 --> 00:45:19.258
That adds up to around 32 acres.

00:45:20.051 --> 00:45:21.051
Here.

00:45:21.052 --> 00:45:25.348
That's around 32 acres.

00:45:26.265 --> 00:45:27.767
Mr. Park was right.

00:45:31.729 --> 00:45:33.105
Gosh.

00:46:09.767 --> 00:46:10.768
Hello.

00:46:11.435 --> 00:46:14.480
I'm Attorney Kang Huiji,
your court-appointed lawyer.

00:46:17.942 --> 00:46:18.943
Hello.

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:26.450
Life in detention
is pretty tough, isn't it?

00:46:29.578 --> 00:46:31.622
I don't need a lawyer.

00:46:33.207 --> 00:46:36.126
I didn't even request a public defender.

00:46:36.127 --> 00:46:38.378
Who called you here?

00:46:38.379 --> 00:46:39.879
Ms. Jeong,

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:41.841 line:20%
you fell under mandatory appointment.

00:46:42.842 --> 00:46:44.050 line:20%
Even if you didn't apply,

00:46:44.051 --> 00:46:47.430 line:20%
you were eligible to have the court
assign you an attorney.

00:46:50.433 --> 00:46:51.934
Then,

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:55.104
just do whatever you have to do and go.

00:46:55.855 --> 00:46:57.565
Don't worry about me.

00:46:58.149 --> 00:46:59.400
My job

00:47:00.401 --> 00:47:02.736
is to hear your side of the story.

00:47:02.737 --> 00:47:05.822
It's to find out what happened and why.

00:47:05.823 --> 00:47:08.242
Hearing it won't change anything.

00:47:09.827 --> 00:47:12.913
I killed Myeongjae...

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:17.167
and I'll just take the punishment.

00:47:17.168 --> 00:47:20.170
Then, it'll be hard for the court
to understand your situation.

00:47:20.171 --> 00:47:21.839
I killed someone.

00:47:23.299 --> 00:47:25.217
What's there to understand?

00:47:28.304 --> 00:47:32.391
I don't want to be understood,
and I don't want to be forgiven either.

00:47:36.103 --> 00:47:39.398
- Just leave.
- I'm not here to understand you

00:47:40.858 --> 00:47:42.693
nor do I have the right to forgive you.

00:47:43.527 --> 00:47:46.906
Like you said, you'll be punished
no matter what your reasons are.

00:47:49.742 --> 00:47:50.743
Yes.

00:47:51.619 --> 00:47:52.703
Exactly.

00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:55.956
So make sure I get punished.

00:47:59.919 --> 00:48:01.629
If you have nothing else to say,

00:48:03.005 --> 00:48:04.215
may I go now?

00:48:37.665 --> 00:48:39.625
<i>I killed my brother.</i>

00:48:40.876 --> 00:48:42.294
<i>I'm the one who killed him.</i>

00:48:43.129 --> 00:48:44.672
<i>And I'll receive punishment.</i>

00:48:50.886 --> 00:48:53.555
LATE-ONSET DEMENTIA IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE

00:48:53.556 --> 00:48:55.182
DATE OF DIAGNOSIS
JUNE 7, 2015

00:48:58.602 --> 00:49:03.356
PHOTO OF CRIME SCENE

00:49:03.357 --> 00:49:04.817
Yes?

00:49:06.944 --> 00:49:10.239
Attorney Kang,
Ms. Jeong Sunja's children are here.

00:49:11.615 --> 00:49:12.741
Her children?

00:49:16.245 --> 00:49:19.622
Are you Ms. Jeong Sunja's son
and daughter?

00:49:19.623 --> 00:49:20.708
Yes.

00:49:22.334 --> 00:49:23.835
What's going to happen to her?

00:49:23.836 --> 00:49:25.713
She'll be going to trial soon.

00:49:26.505 --> 00:49:28.756
But she hasn't told me anything yet,

00:49:28.757 --> 00:49:31.510
so it's been difficult
to prepare her defense.

00:49:32.303 --> 00:49:35.389
How did she end up
living with her brother?

00:49:36.182 --> 00:49:38.058
I didn't know she had any children.

00:49:43.272 --> 00:49:44.273
Well...

00:49:45.232 --> 00:49:47.358
Our mom was the only family
our uncle had left.

00:49:47.359 --> 00:49:50.112
So she lived with him to take care of him.

00:49:51.906 --> 00:49:55.034
Then, did you two visit often?

00:49:56.744 --> 00:49:57.745
No.

00:49:58.746 --> 00:50:01.164
We didn't think it was something
we had to be involved in.

00:50:01.165 --> 00:50:04.126
How did Ms. Jeong manage financially?

00:50:05.044 --> 00:50:07.129
She likely had her pension

00:50:07.713 --> 00:50:10.257
and some caregiver support benefits.

00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:13.051
Did either of you
provide any financial help?

00:50:13.052 --> 00:50:14.345
No, we...

00:50:15.012 --> 00:50:16.889
We couldn't afford to do that.

00:50:18.849 --> 00:50:19.892
Can she get out?

00:50:25.981 --> 00:50:27.191
It's a murder charge.

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.277
It's not an easy situation to get out of.

00:50:31.987 --> 00:50:33.614
Gosh, Uncle Myeongjae...

00:50:35.699 --> 00:50:36.700
Would it...

00:50:37.993 --> 00:50:40.162
be okay if I visited where they stayed?

00:50:40.704 --> 00:50:43.082
- Hello?
<i>- Why did you call?</i>

00:50:43.916 --> 00:50:45.458
I have something to tell you.

00:50:45.459 --> 00:50:47.418
I wanted to ask if you could stop by.

00:50:47.419 --> 00:50:49.630
<i>Why call me in
if you won't take the case?</i>

00:50:50.256 --> 00:50:52.883
<i>I'm not going!
I'm busy looking for someone else.</i>

00:50:53.676 --> 00:50:56.762
We never said that.
We just said there wasn't enough evidence.

00:50:57.972 --> 00:51:00.391
Please come by.
It's something worth hearing.

00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:04.770
How about later at 5:00 p.m.?

00:51:05.604 --> 00:51:07.273
<i>We'll see if I have the time.</i>

00:51:08.023 --> 00:51:09.191
I'll see you later.

00:51:25.457 --> 00:51:26.709
You can go in.

00:51:27.293 --> 00:51:29.085
You're not coming in with me?

00:51:29.086 --> 00:51:30.169
No.

00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:32.464
We don't really feel like going in.

00:51:33.924 --> 00:51:35.259
Call us when you're done.

00:52:15.549 --> 00:52:20.596
ORAL MEDICATION

00:52:30.773 --> 00:52:32.107
MEDICAL RECEIPT

00:52:34.735 --> 00:52:37.863
<i>Tuesday, December 31st.</i>

00:52:38.822 --> 00:52:40.616
<i>No response at all.</i>

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:43.284
<i>My chest felt heavy.</i>

00:52:43.285 --> 00:52:45.244
<i>His breathing grew shallow and rough.</i>

00:52:45.245 --> 00:52:46.371
<i>December 27th.</i>

00:52:46.372 --> 00:52:48.539
<i>He opened his eyes,
but they were glazed over.</i>

00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:50.291
<i>There was no reaction to my voice.</i>

00:52:50.292 --> 00:52:54.170
<i>I wish I could live
just one day longer than Myeongjae.</i>

00:52:54.171 --> 00:52:55.672
<i>December 25th.</i>

00:52:55.673 --> 00:52:57.423
<i>I called his name in the morning.</i>

00:52:57.424 --> 00:53:00.009
<i>He blinked and turned his head slightly.</i>

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:03.221
<i>His eyes were clear for just a moment.</i>

00:53:03.222 --> 00:53:04.722
<i>He had a bit of porridge,</i>

00:53:04.723 --> 00:53:07.559
<i>and then slept a long time,
as if all his strength was gone.</i>

00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:09.852
<i>December 28th.</i>

00:53:09.853 --> 00:53:13.022
<i>He twitched slightly when I held his hand.</i>

00:53:13.023 --> 00:53:15.775
<i>His face looked peaceful,
and I felt more at ease.</i>

00:53:15.776 --> 00:53:16.901
<i>December 30th.</i>

00:53:16.902 --> 00:53:19.195
<i>I held his hand,
but there was no strength at all.</i>

00:53:19.196 --> 00:53:20.446
<i>I just kept the IV in.</i>

00:53:20.447 --> 00:53:23.908
<i>What am I hoping for
in trying to keep Myeongjae alive?</i>

00:53:23.909 --> 00:53:28.080
<i>Does he even want to live this way?</i>

00:53:29.498 --> 00:53:31.333
<i>December 29th.</i>

00:53:31.917 --> 00:53:33.793
<i>No response at all.</i>

00:53:33.794 --> 00:53:35.921
<i>He can barely swallow.</i>

00:53:38.382 --> 00:53:40.759
<i>No one's willing to hear me out.</i>

00:53:42.594 --> 00:53:44.888
<i>No one cares.</i>

00:53:53.897 --> 00:53:57.192
DEMENTIA CARE CENTER

00:54:01.989 --> 00:54:03.531
Ms. Jeong Sunja?

00:54:03.532 --> 00:54:08.912
She didn't quite meet the criteria,
so we could only offer minimal support.

00:54:09.455 --> 00:54:13.167
She had children, so that made it hard
to qualify for other programs.

00:54:14.668 --> 00:54:17.170
But from what I heard,
her kids were indifferent.

00:54:17.171 --> 00:54:20.174
If you knew that,
you could've given her support.

00:54:20.758 --> 00:54:22.509
We have to follow the guidelines.

00:54:23.135 --> 00:54:24.970
If we could, we'd give all our help.

00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:28.931
Then, how did she manage to get by?

00:54:28.932 --> 00:54:31.601
I heard she had some insurance payouts

00:54:31.602 --> 00:54:34.563
to cover her living expenses
and his medical bills.

00:54:36.482 --> 00:54:38.274
- Insurance payouts?
- Yes.

00:54:38.275 --> 00:54:40.443
She apparently had cancer insurance.

00:54:40.444 --> 00:54:43.572
But she was never able to use it
for her own treatment.

00:54:45.032 --> 00:54:46.450
I heard it was terminal cancer.

00:54:55.876 --> 00:54:57.044
Thank you.

00:55:00.631 --> 00:55:02.090
You're in a good mood.

00:55:03.008 --> 00:55:04.009
So are you.

00:55:05.385 --> 00:55:08.639
Mr. Park must be the one feeling good.
It turns out he was right.

00:55:10.265 --> 00:55:12.601
What if he really doesn't come
because he's upset?

00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:15.853
You could've just told him
we figured it out.

00:55:15.854 --> 00:55:18.815
Well, I was going to tell him in person.

00:55:31.328 --> 00:55:33.413
You're not going to
say anything again today?

00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:45.300
Then, I'll talk.

00:55:46.426 --> 00:55:47.761
Ms. Jeong,

00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:52.057
you had to take care of your brother
since he had no one else.

00:55:54.017 --> 00:55:55.769
You didn't want your kids

00:55:56.395 --> 00:55:59.147
to feel burdened by their uncle.

00:56:00.232 --> 00:56:02.317
That's why you couldn't ask for help.

00:56:03.986 --> 00:56:06.487
Instead, you asked the state for help.

00:56:06.488 --> 00:56:09.741
But you always fell
slightly out of criteria,

00:56:10.701 --> 00:56:13.537
so all you could receive in support
was the bare minimum.

00:56:15.330 --> 00:56:17.373
That went on for 10 years.

00:56:17.374 --> 00:56:19.334
And you must've gradually become scared.

00:56:21.211 --> 00:56:25.132
You were worried you might die
before your brother.

00:56:28.051 --> 00:56:30.721
Then, you found out you had cancer.

00:56:36.059 --> 00:56:37.227
How do you...

00:56:40.063 --> 00:56:41.565
know all of this?

00:56:45.193 --> 00:56:47.696
I want to hear your story,
Ms. Jeong.

00:56:53.952 --> 00:56:55.203
No one...

00:56:58.415 --> 00:57:01.710
Literally, no one would listen to me.

00:57:03.837 --> 00:57:05.464
All I could do was endure.

00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:08.050
I didn't have a choice.

00:57:09.009 --> 00:57:11.261
I couldn't die first.

00:57:12.971 --> 00:57:14.139
Do you know

00:57:16.099 --> 00:57:19.019
what my first thought was...

00:57:21.813 --> 00:57:24.483
when I learned I had terminal cancer?

00:57:29.196 --> 00:57:30.864
"At least the insurance will pay out."

00:57:32.866 --> 00:57:34.785
I thought

00:57:35.494 --> 00:57:37.746
maybe things would be okay for now.

00:57:38.747 --> 00:57:40.165
I felt relieved.

00:57:44.711 --> 00:57:47.089
It meant I could've died first.

00:57:47.798 --> 00:57:48.840
But my goodness,

00:57:49.675 --> 00:57:51.510
I actually felt relieved.

00:57:53.887 --> 00:57:54.971
I prayed every day

00:57:55.555 --> 00:57:59.685
to live just one day longer
than Myeongjae.

00:58:01.687 --> 00:58:05.815
But I couldn't leave it
to the heavens anymore.

00:58:05.816 --> 00:58:10.570
They wanted to take me first.

00:58:12.739 --> 00:58:15.616
Is that why you felt
you had no other choice?

00:58:15.617 --> 00:58:19.538
I don't want to say I had no choice.

00:58:24.835 --> 00:58:26.795
How can I say

00:58:28.046 --> 00:58:31.299
I had no choice but to kill someone?

00:58:32.008 --> 00:58:35.094
But that's the story
behind what led you here.

00:58:35.095 --> 00:58:36.763
You need to explain that in court.

00:58:39.766 --> 00:58:40.809
In any case,

00:58:42.185 --> 00:58:43.311
I'm going to die soon.

00:58:46.314 --> 00:58:49.568
There's no need to ask
for a lighter sentence.

00:58:52.195 --> 00:58:54.531
My brother...

00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:03.749
I killed him with my own hands.

00:59:05.709 --> 00:59:09.463
How could I dare ask for forgiveness?
What right do I have?

00:59:16.011 --> 00:59:19.639
Then, only take the punishment
for what you deserve.

00:59:22.017 --> 00:59:24.770
Not every crime gets the same sentence.

00:59:27.189 --> 00:59:29.232
You'll be punished
based on your own actions.

00:59:30.233 --> 00:59:32.235
And it's my job to explain that.

00:59:36.448 --> 00:59:38.158
Please let me do my job.

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:04.518
<i>The number you have dialed
is not available. Please leave...</i>

01:00:22.577 --> 01:00:23.828
<i>The number you have dialed...</i>

01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:26.039
PARK MANSU

01:00:37.551 --> 01:00:42.513
And so, we conclude the defendant caused
the death of the victim by asphyxiation

01:00:42.514 --> 01:00:44.891
and committed murder.

01:00:46.434 --> 01:00:48.060
Okay, Counsel.

01:00:48.061 --> 01:00:51.189
Please state your position on the charges.

01:00:51.773 --> 01:00:54.608
The defendant admits to all charges
and accepts all evidence.

01:00:54.609 --> 01:00:58.238
Okay. We will review the evidence now.

01:01:19.551 --> 01:01:21.427
We've concluded the evidence review.

01:01:21.428 --> 01:01:23.972
Prosecutor, state your sentencing request.

01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:29.352
We request a sentence
of 10 years in prison.

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:34.649
Counsel, present your statement.

01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:44.910
I believe taking a life

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:49.371
is something
that can never be truly forgiven.

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:50.998
The defendant understood that as well

01:01:50.999 --> 01:01:52.791
and turned herself in
right after her crime.

01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:55.462
She has consistently
admitted responsibility from the start.

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:59.299
She was the victim's sole caregiver.

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.134
Mr. Jeong suffered from severe dementia,

01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:05.138
and Ms. Jeong cared for him
for over 10 years.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:10.060
Receiving practically no support
from either her family or society,

01:02:10.644 --> 01:02:13.563
she had to handle both the caregiving
and financial burden.

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:17.651
In the midst of all that...

01:02:21.696 --> 01:02:24.366
Ms. Jeong was recently diagnosed
with terminal cancer.

01:02:36.336 --> 01:02:39.422
Ms. Jeong couldn't bear
the possibility of dying

01:02:40.465 --> 01:02:43.051
even a day before her brother.

01:02:44.636 --> 01:02:47.638
Ms. Jeong is not asking for leniency.

01:02:47.639 --> 01:02:51.267
She just wants to take responsibility
for the crime she committed.

01:02:53.395 --> 01:02:56.564
But this crime happened
in the context of fractured caregiving,

01:02:57.399 --> 01:02:59.776
continuous isolation,
and prolonged exhaustion.

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:04.364
So I ask, Your Honor,

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:09.160
that you take into account her remorse,
the circumstances that led to this act,

01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:13.957
and her current health condition
in your judgment.

01:03:26.845 --> 01:03:28.054
Mom, why...

01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:36.938
God, no...

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.248
Are you skipping meals?

01:03:56.124 --> 01:03:58.877
I eat too well,
so don't worry, okay?

01:03:59.711 --> 01:04:01.796
I almost forgot. Mom.

01:04:02.922 --> 01:04:05.550
You didn't forget
your health checkup appointment, right?

01:04:06.134 --> 01:04:09.763
- I told you I don't need to get one.
- I told you to get checked.

01:04:11.806 --> 01:04:14.768
Right. I found what you asked for.

01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:17.729
It was tucked in the back of the wardrobe.

01:04:18.229 --> 01:04:20.857
The scholarship certificate?
Mom, do it after dinner.

01:04:21.399 --> 01:04:22.942
Geez, why is she like that?

01:04:37.665 --> 01:04:40.919
We sure got a lot of help
from a bunch of different places.

01:04:44.422 --> 01:04:46.216
I got this one in college.

01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:49.427
This one too.

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:52.347
Yeah, these are all from college.

01:04:54.265 --> 01:04:55.266 line:20%
CERTIFICATE OF SCHOLARSHIP

01:04:55.975 --> 01:04:57.226
I got this one in law school.

01:04:57.227 --> 01:04:59.561
It's when we got support
for living expenses.

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:01.772
It was called
the Dandelion Scholarship Foundation.

01:05:01.773 --> 01:05:02.857
Right?

01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:10.907
DANDELION SCHOLARSHIP FOUNDATION
CHAIRMAN KIM HYUNGMIN

01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:17.997
- What?
- It's nothing.

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:20.667
Let's eat. Eat up, Mom.

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:35.598
Hello.

01:05:38.685 --> 01:05:41.061
- Hello, good morning.
- Attorney Cho.

01:05:41.062 --> 01:05:44.064
Mr. Seong wanted to see you
in his office when you arrived.

01:05:44.065 --> 01:05:45.275
Okay.

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:50.655
Come in.

01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:53.908
- Mr. Seong, did you ask for me?
- Yeah.

01:05:54.659 --> 01:05:56.661
You know Mr. Jang Sugil well, right?

01:05:57.162 --> 01:05:58.163
It's been a long time.

01:06:03.543 --> 01:06:04.543
Hello.

01:06:04.544 --> 01:06:05.962
Well, have a seat.

01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:09.090
Director Jang's here to assign you a case.

01:06:10.341 --> 01:06:14.596
Well, I drank just a tiny bit
and had a little accident while driving.

01:06:15.513 --> 01:06:16.806
Help me out, okay?

01:06:17.557 --> 01:06:18.975
You're my go-to lawyer.

01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:32.155
- Hello, Attorney Ha.
- Hello, sir.

01:06:33.031 --> 01:06:34.908
Hold on!

01:06:36.034 --> 01:06:37.035
Just a second.

01:06:38.536 --> 01:06:40.371
Attorney Ha. Just getting in?

01:06:40.955 --> 01:06:42.207
Yes, hello.

01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:47.503
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:07:00.266 --> 01:07:02.894
He just bumped into someone.

01:07:03.519 --> 01:07:06.396
It wasn't even a big accident.
It should be an easy case.

01:07:06.397 --> 01:07:08.065
You're telling me to take it, right?

01:07:08.066 --> 01:07:09.483
Of course. Who else?

01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:11.903
Director Jang came here
specifically to hire you.

01:07:17.408 --> 01:07:18.826
I won't take it, sir.

01:07:19.994 --> 01:07:22.038
- What?
- I don't want to take it.

01:07:24.582 --> 01:07:26.291
What do you mean?
You want me to do it then?

01:07:26.292 --> 01:07:30.087
Well, you could take it
or tell him to go find someone else.

01:07:30.088 --> 01:07:31.673
That's up to you, sir.

01:07:34.133 --> 01:07:36.678
You're talking like you run the place.

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:39.304
If this keeps up, I can't work with you.

01:07:39.305 --> 01:07:41.515
Yes, because we won't have to anymore.

01:07:41.516 --> 01:07:43.851
I quit. Find yourself another associate.

01:08:06.708 --> 01:08:07.750
Come in.

01:08:10.545 --> 01:08:12.297
- You're here early.
- Yeah.

01:08:14.173 --> 01:08:16.133
- Well...
- Mr. Park Mansu.

01:08:16.134 --> 01:08:17.467
He's still not answering, right?

01:08:17.468 --> 01:08:19.429
I've called him multiple times too.

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:24.392
Should we drop by later after work?

01:08:26.686 --> 01:08:27.687
Sure.

01:08:30.857 --> 01:08:32.358
PARK MANSU

01:08:37.071 --> 01:08:38.072
Hello?

01:08:47.206 --> 01:08:48.207
Where was it?

01:09:52.105 --> 01:09:59.070 line:20%
Law and The City

01:10:29.517 --> 01:10:33.228
Law and The City

01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:36.774 line:20%
- What is this all of a sudden?
- Exactly what I just said.

01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:38.276 line:20%
Is this law firm a joke to you?

01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:40.986 line:20%
I just touched her.

01:10:40.987 --> 01:10:43.614 line:20%
- Excuse me?
- It wasn't an accident. I touched her.

01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:46.742 line:20%
I want to give it another shot.

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:48.953 line:20%
Okay, good job!

01:10:49.787 --> 01:10:51.748 line:20%
I liked you, Attorney Ha.

01:10:52.373 --> 01:10:55.333 line:20%
<i>-We're being audited.
- We're dealing with a mess right now.</i>

01:10:55.334 --> 01:10:57.794 line:20%
- We didn't do anything wrong--
- What's your purpose?

01:10:57.795 --> 01:11:00.046 line:20%
What was your purpose in merging?

01:11:00.047 --> 01:11:02.883 line:20%
No matter what I say
to try to convince you...

01:11:02.884 --> 01:11:04.760 line:20%
you won't change your mind, right?

01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:06.679 line:20%
<i>I'd like to try it my own way now.</i>

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:09.807
<i>Actually, there's something
I wasn't able to say earlier too.</i>

01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:15.062 line:20%
