00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:16.600
Where did you get this?

00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:17.733
mirror answer

00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.133
impossible

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.666
He will predict our signals.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.766
it wasn't me bro

00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.166
I am not the one you are looking for.

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.766
I wasn't the one who leaked it, don't get me started on this.

00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.133
No one admits it.

00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.333
We cheated too.

00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:31.800
We cheated too, didn't we?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.800
sorry lyn

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.133
You may not like what you hear, but

00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:35.966
I am hungry.

00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:36.766
Grace is the one

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.466
I copied Kyle.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.666
i think you give the answers to kyle

00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.766
you are the one who made the cheat cheat

00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:44.766
You passed it to Claire.

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.533
He passed it to Buzz.

00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.300
and passed it to Kyle

00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:49.333
Am I right?

00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:51.666
guys

00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.300
The cheat sheet is from me.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.600
I am the one who leaked.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.400
tony please

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.666
please

00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.066
i'll make sure that they won't tell any of our parents

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.766
or our

00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:05.566
teachers

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.166
the worst

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:06.866
that could happen

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.733
is that they will just get mad at you

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.766
but once this is all done

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.166
they'll forget about it and

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.200
pat and lynn

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.866
they won't do anything to you either

00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.733
because that would implicate them too

00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:21.666
tommy please

00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:25.533
please

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:32.133
data

00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:35.366
You are just avoiding me.

00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:38.566
no matter how hard I try

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.066
to get closer to you

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:41.800
You don't like me.

00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:45.866
but I still hope that one day

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.766
you would realize how much i care for you

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.966
and you would choose me

00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:06.200
When did I do that for you?

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.066
will you choose me

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.066
Well, don't ask him for help.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.066
What do you think of me?

00:03:02.533 --> 00:03:03.666
yes i promise

00:03:11.866 --> 00:03:12.733
there is only one

00:03:12.866 --> 00:03:13.666
I like it.

00:03:47.266 --> 00:03:48.600
I was with you.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.700
Why is this?

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.500
you're right

00:04:12.866 --> 00:04:14.166
Good thing Miss believed.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.266
Briones to me

00:04:16.566 --> 00:04:17.200
maybe

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.000
They realized that I have no connection to Kyle.

00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:22.266
and then they couldn't show any evidence either

00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:23.400
against me, tsaka

00:04:23.533 --> 00:04:24.000
feigned

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.400
in the pool

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.400
You know I don't have any friends.

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:26.700
At the drama club, huh?

00:04:27.366 --> 00:04:30.133
Don't think about it too much so you don't get stressed.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.800
the important thing is

00:04:32.133 --> 00:04:33.266
you're lucky

00:04:33.766 --> 00:04:34.566
you are good

00:04:35.366 --> 00:04:36.133
but you know

00:04:36.133 --> 00:04:36.933
my news

00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:39.666
They said they would tighten the next exam to avoid

00:04:39.766 --> 00:04:40.566
cheating

00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:44.066
really

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.733
actually

00:04:46.666 --> 00:04:47.700
I really don't understand.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.600
I can imagine it.

00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:49.966
how do they

00:04:49.966 --> 00:04:51.533
It's a cheap trick.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.100
maybe they

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:01.400
have their personal reasons

00:05:07.166 --> 00:05:07.966
I agree.

00:05:07.966 --> 00:05:08.766
we should not tolerate

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:09.366
cheating

00:05:09.366 --> 00:05:10.933
and that's all really wrong

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.000
but

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.100
maybe

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.166
we shouldn't

00:05:15.166 --> 00:05:16.466
judge the person either

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.766
maybe they're just trying

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.700
to survive

00:05:26.366 --> 00:05:28.333
You know, I get your point.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.400
pero i don't think survival

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.200
is an excuse to do something wrong

00:05:32.766 --> 00:05:34.500
because whatever your reason is

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.566
if you are wrong

00:05:35.933 --> 00:05:36.733
the

00:05:37.966 --> 00:05:38.766
they are

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.300
it's not over yet

00:05:43.533 --> 00:05:45.133
hey hi hi lyn hi bank

00:05:45.333 --> 00:05:46.133
have a seat

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.300
That's okay, have a seat.

00:05:49.566 --> 00:05:51.266
I'm coming to you now.

00:05:51.766 --> 00:05:53.000
because you are considered

00:05:53.133 --> 00:05:53.933
two from school

00:05:53.933 --> 00:05:55.466
for scholarship abroad

00:05:55.966 --> 00:05:57.166
full scholarship yun

00:05:57.533 --> 00:05:59.133
and if you ever get chosen

00:05:59.733 --> 00:06:01.000
The scholarship has already answered.

00:06:01.133 --> 00:06:01.733
transport

00:06:01.733 --> 00:06:02.533
and accommodation

00:06:03.533 --> 00:06:05.566
but of course since scholarship to abroad

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.466
there are many

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:07.266
requirements

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.100
first you need to take the stic

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.100
examination

00:06:11.466 --> 00:06:12.733
you should also maintain

00:06:12.866 --> 00:06:13.666
high academic

00:06:13.766 --> 00:06:14.566
standing

00:06:14.733 --> 00:06:15.733
and most importantly

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.733
no behavioral issues

00:06:18.466 --> 00:06:19.400
so you immediately

00:06:19.533 --> 00:06:20.600
what we thought

00:06:21.666 --> 00:06:23.000
because I know it's coming

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:24.066
you are in the criteria

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.766
and i know you both can wing it

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.900
thank you po miss

00:06:29.933 --> 00:06:30.666
gonzales

00:06:30.666 --> 00:06:31.100
of course

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.666
thank you

00:06:31.666 --> 00:06:32.500
i trust you guys

00:06:36.466 --> 00:06:37.266
okay, please

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.400
you know

00:06:42.066 --> 00:06:42.966
I get it.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.533
why does dad want to put me in this posetti

00:06:48.966 --> 00:06:50.200
it's because of this opportunity

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.200
and he knows that I want to study abroad

00:06:53.566 --> 00:06:55.200
So you really want to study abroad?

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.700
mmm I want

00:06:56.933 --> 00:06:57.733
are you

00:06:58.266 --> 00:06:59.066
hmmm

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.133
I'm still having second thoughts.

00:07:02.166 --> 00:07:04.733
Why did I realize what career I wanted?

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.666
I want

00:07:05.666 --> 00:07:06.466
a doctor

00:07:07.133 --> 00:07:07.933
really

00:07:08.266 --> 00:07:10.400
Do you know if you can do that?

00:07:10.533 --> 00:07:11.333
thank you

00:07:11.666 --> 00:07:12.400
eh, puzzle

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.200
Why do you want to be a doctor?

00:07:15.766 --> 00:07:17.766
Maybe it's because mom is sick today.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.400
and you know that

00:07:19.566 --> 00:07:20.666
I am a witness to the situation.

00:07:20.766 --> 00:07:21.666
at the public hospital

00:07:21.966 --> 00:07:23.066
Poor patient.

00:07:23.166 --> 00:07:24.133
when you don't have money

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.666
and I don't want to

00:07:25.666 --> 00:07:27.266
that what happened to dad will happen again

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.566
if you don't mind me asking

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.133
What happened to your dad?

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.166
when we were still living in Mindoro

00:07:36.266 --> 00:07:37.266
because he/she is sick

00:07:37.566 --> 00:07:38.533
colon cancer

00:07:39.533 --> 00:07:39.900
of course

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.866
He doesn't want to get treatment because he doesn't want to spend money.

00:07:41.933 --> 00:07:43.666
That's why mom hid it from us.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.400
you know

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.733
They're just like mom, so it's annoying.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.333
really get married

00:07:50.333 --> 00:07:51.066
but you know

00:07:51.066 --> 00:07:52.533
He's still in the hospital.

00:07:52.766 --> 00:07:53.766
until later

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:54.200
died

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.066
because doctors are not good at handling

00:07:56.133 --> 00:07:56.933
to him/her

00:07:58.366 --> 00:07:59.500
but you know that

00:07:59.566 --> 00:08:01.666
I don't want what happened to happen again.

00:08:02.133 --> 00:08:03.200
you are incapable

00:08:03.366 --> 00:08:04.300
to help them

00:08:06.966 --> 00:08:07.766
i'm sorry

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.466
How are you? It's okay.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.866
at least no

00:08:13.333 --> 00:08:14.933
if I were to study medicine here

00:08:15.366 --> 00:08:16.000
there is

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.566
inhouse

00:08:16.566 --> 00:08:17.366
doctor and mother

00:08:17.533 --> 00:08:18.533
He doesn't need it anymore.

00:08:18.566 --> 00:08:20.133
choose long in hospitals

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.100
they are

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.366
mmm yeah

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.400
you?

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.666
Why do you want to go abroad?

00:08:27.466 --> 00:08:28.266
ah

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.566
I want more.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.500
mawiden

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.166
My knowledge and world are still

00:08:32.733 --> 00:08:34.500
I think I like the feeling of

00:08:34.933 --> 00:08:35.900
have a new idea

00:08:36.166 --> 00:08:36.933
or new

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:37.533
experience

00:08:37.533 --> 00:08:38.666
that I know nothing

00:08:38.933 --> 00:08:39.733
done

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.766
I will study.

00:08:45.166 --> 00:08:45.966
Are you tired of being

00:08:46.066 --> 00:08:47.100

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:53.566
oblivious

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:54.366
to a lot of things

00:08:55.266 --> 00:08:56.700
so I don't overthink

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.700
in things

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.700
You know I sometimes think about it.

00:09:01.466 --> 00:09:02.266

00:09:03.266 --> 00:09:04.066

00:09:04.666 --> 00:09:05.933
I am not a top student.

00:09:06.733 --> 00:09:07.566
Is there still one?

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:08.200

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.166
I have those people.

00:09:09.933 --> 00:09:10.733
or maybe later

00:09:10.866 --> 00:09:11.466

00:09:11.466 --> 00:09:13.733

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.266

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:29.400
what is that

00:28:30.666 --> 00:28:31.733
Why not now?

00:28:34.333 --> 00:28:35.133
okay, okay

00:28:35.733 --> 00:28:37.100
later, after exams

00:28:37.733 --> 00:28:39.400
pasuspense pa to

00:28:39.666 --> 00:28:40.533
tell me

00:28:41.666 --> 00:28:42.800
just later

00:28:43.733 --> 00:28:44.533
yes

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.266
I'll think about it.

00:28:46.366 --> 00:28:47.166
until exams

00:28:49.533 --> 00:28:50.900
if my score drops

00:28:51.266 --> 00:28:52.066
your fault

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.666
Just a reminder that our campus is

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:02.366
speaker

00:29:02.366 --> 00:29:03.366
is under maintenance

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:04.300
still

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:04.966
so possible

00:29:04.966 --> 00:29:06.100
we can still hear

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.000
of unnecessary sounds

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.400
just against

00:29:14.933 --> 00:29:15.733
oh bread

00:29:16.266 --> 00:29:17.100
later

00:29:17.566 --> 00:29:18.600
See you at the library.

00:29:20.566 --> 00:29:21.800
bye baby

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:40.900
get one

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:41.700
and pass

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.900
you're about to begin your first exam

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:46.766
after the cheating issue

00:29:47.333 --> 00:29:48.533
we will be stricter

00:29:49.133 --> 00:29:50.666
I'm late to talk.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:52.533
automatic failure

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.200
when you are finished

00:29:54.466 --> 00:29:55.333
leave your papers

00:29:55.466 --> 00:29:56.266
on my desk

00:29:56.333 --> 00:29:57.166
your first exam

00:29:57.366 --> 00:29:58.166
will end

00:29:58.266 --> 00:29:59.066
strictly

00:29:59.066 --> 00:29:59.733
at eleven

00:29:59.733 --> 00:30:00.533
fifteen

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.466
you guys will be allowed a fifteen minute break

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.866
before the next exam in philosophy

00:30:06.366 --> 00:30:07.133
which begins

00:30:07.133 --> 00:30:07.933
at exactly

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:08.900
eleven thirty

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:13.933
yuminaw start

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:17.933
you may now start

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.733
i need more clients

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:55.900
based on

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:56.500
calculations

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.700
ko i need a total of three hundred

00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.600
thousand pesos

00:33:00.066 --> 00:33:01.266
My earnings were insufficient at that time.

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.200
midterms

00:33:02.333 --> 00:33:04.966
and since this semester will be the last time to give

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.133
I have an answer for you.

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:07.933
i still need one hundred sixty k

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:10.533
more than a friend

00:33:10.733 --> 00:33:11.466
the treatment

00:33:11.466 --> 00:33:12.266
I love you

00:33:14.666 --> 00:33:15.466
I like you.

00:33:16.266 --> 00:33:17.100
that's tough

00:33:17.933 --> 00:33:19.666
It's getting hard to find clients.

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.700
willing to pay twenty k for the finals

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.533
so only ten k

00:33:23.666 --> 00:33:24.766
fee ko for the finals

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.200
so sixteen

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.766
I need more clients.

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:28.700
can you do it

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:29.700
but friend

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.400
I just consider you a bank.

00:33:36.566 --> 00:33:37.366
two weeks

00:33:37.366 --> 00:33:37.866
different

00:33:37.866 --> 00:33:38.666
sections

00:33:41.366 --> 00:33:42.333
it seems possible

00:33:42.466 --> 00:33:43.666
ten k is reasonable

00:33:46.766 --> 00:33:47.600
How is this?

00:33:47.866 --> 00:33:48.666
How is this?

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:49.800
good

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:51.333
well if i'm gonna give you more clients

00:33:51.366 --> 00:33:52.666
how are you gonna give them the answers

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.600
We will take the exam together in different classrooms.

00:33:56.133 --> 00:33:57.100
i'll give them the answers

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.133
by taking advantage of our defective

00:33:59.333 --> 00:34:00.133
speakers

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.566
I can do it.

00:34:06.066 --> 00:34:06.866
okay like this

00:34:07.666 --> 00:34:08.700
I have four sounds.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.600
ipeplay

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:11.400
irrepresented and ang a

00:34:11.566 --> 00:34:12.500
b c

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:15.866
And what kind of piano do you play?

00:34:16.866 --> 00:34:17.800
no can

00:34:17.933 --> 00:34:18.766
hindi obvious

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:20.300
kaya the sounds

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:22.500
i will use will be as if galing lang sa defective

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:23.400
our speakers

00:34:30.766 --> 00:34:32.300
This is the starting signal.

00:34:42.366 --> 00:34:43.366
this is the one

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:00.500
this is the one

00:35:15.066 --> 00:35:15.866
this is the one

00:35:33.733 --> 00:35:35.333
then this is it

00:35:55.533 --> 00:35:56.333
in the hall

00:35:56.733 --> 00:35:58.900
There's still a second part to the exam, right?

00:36:00.566 --> 00:36:02.200
I still need courage.

00:36:04.766 --> 00:36:05.800
Did he send it?

00:36:06.733 --> 00:36:07.500
Don't be.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:08.300
noisy

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:11.166
yes, he sent it, huh?

00:36:11.466 --> 00:36:12.466
Why didn't I hear?

00:36:12.933 --> 00:36:13.600
predicted

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.400
I continue.

00:36:14.533 --> 00:36:15.766
Listen carefully.

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:16.733
of course

00:36:16.733 --> 00:36:17.666
hindi obvious

00:36:18.133 --> 00:36:19.100
just remember

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:20.933
the bouncing sound

00:36:21.566 --> 00:36:22.966
that's the starting signal

00:36:23.733 --> 00:36:24.666
the next ones

00:36:25.533 --> 00:36:26.533
those are the answers

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:29.900
get one

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:30.700
and pass

00:37:31.133 --> 00:37:32.933
we're about to begin your next exam

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:34.366
when you're done

00:37:34.366 --> 00:37:35.133
answering

00:37:35.133 --> 00:37:35.900
you may leave

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:36.933
and take your lunch break

00:37:37.866 --> 00:37:39.200
you have forty five minutes

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:45.800
time starts now

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.266
Listen carefully.

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:02.600
if this is a bounce

00:40:02.766 --> 00:40:03.566
note

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.066
that's the starting signal

00:40:05.533 --> 00:40:06.466
the next ones

00:40:06.733 --> 00:40:07.600
those are the answers

00:40:32.566 --> 00:40:33.366
ah miss

00:40:33.466 --> 00:40:34.166
briones

00:40:34.166 --> 00:40:36.533
It seems like something is wrong with our speakers.

00:40:49.133 --> 00:40:50.166
why what's the problem

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.200
I noticed that there seemed to be four

00:40:54.366 --> 00:40:56.166
that sound coming from the speakers

00:40:57.166 --> 00:40:58.500
and I think those four

00:40:58.666 --> 00:40:59.266
corresponding

00:40:59.266 --> 00:41:00.533
in letters for the answer

00:41:01.766 --> 00:41:02.566
he is not

00:41:02.666 --> 00:41:03.733
obvious at the beginning

00:41:04.366 --> 00:41:06.100
but just listen carefully

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:11.966
if you have finished your exam

00:41:12.366 --> 00:41:13.366
you may leave

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:16.600
Miss Periones

00:41:17.533 --> 00:41:19.100
I miss you, even if it's just to listen to it again.

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:21.066
I noted that each letter

00:41:21.166 --> 00:41:22.200
with different sounds

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:24.100
that

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.000
like

00:41:25.533 --> 00:41:26.333
beep

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.533
then the v feedback

00:41:30.766 --> 00:41:31.766
the c looks like

00:41:32.333 --> 00:41:34.733
buzzer then the v is cracked

00:41:35.766 --> 00:41:37.066
What nonsense is that?

00:41:38.166 --> 00:41:39.600
Go ahead, Miss Primis.

00:41:40.866 --> 00:41:41.666
if you don't stop

00:41:41.733 --> 00:41:43.100
I will teach an invalid.

00:41:43.266 --> 00:41:44.166
this is your exam

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:48.700
I'm sorry.

00:42:59.733 --> 00:43:01.566
people on your speaker during exam

00:44:51.266 --> 00:44:52.133
Mr. Bastard

00:44:57.533 --> 00:44:58.933
Someone is using the speakers.

00:44:59.066 --> 00:44:59.866
let's give

00:44:59.933 --> 00:45:00.733
of the answer

00:45:17.666 --> 00:45:18.700
I'll find the key.

00:45:32.733 --> 00:45:33.533
Where are you?

00:47:07.466 --> 00:47:08.333
this is serious

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:09.733
The bank already knows.

00:47:09.866 --> 00:47:11.933
and he went to the storage room and brought some more

00:47:11.966 --> 00:47:12.766
teacher

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:16.566
Do you have any more ideas?

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.000
who is behind this

00:47:18.333 --> 00:47:20.133
Can you talk to me please?

00:47:20.466 --> 00:47:22.466
What is taking advantage of?

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:23.400
they are ours

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:24.366
do you notice

00:47:24.366 --> 00:47:25.166
her new phone

00:47:25.566 --> 00:47:26.600
i gave that to her

00:47:28.166 --> 00:47:29.400
he has a tracking device

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:31.066
Are you a serious believer?

00:47:31.166 --> 00:47:32.000
He is going home now.

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:33.866
okay let's be rational

00:47:34.166 --> 00:47:35.700
This is my relative's house.

00:47:35.866 --> 00:47:36.666
family friend

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:37.533
i'm so sorry

00:47:37.533 --> 00:47:38.333
i'm so sorry

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:39.400
guys

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:41.333
Don't do it.

00:47:41.333 --> 00:47:42.133
make a fool of

00:47:42.366 --> 00:47:43.900
I will repeat the question.

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.933
Which one of you?

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:47.166
the mastermind

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:48.133
in cheating

00:47:48.133 --> 00:47:48.933
that happened
