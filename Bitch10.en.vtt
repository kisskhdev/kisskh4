WEBVTT

00:00:57.667 --> 00:00:59.476
Hey!

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.833
Are we close enough
for you to call at this hour?

00:01:04.167 --> 00:01:05.405
What?

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:09.300
You're in front of my house?

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.009
Well...

00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:20.376
Usually at engagement
ceremonies or weddings,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.643
close friends give
congratulatory speeches, right?

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:29.409
Can I do that?

00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:30.543
What?

00:01:30.567 --> 00:01:32.409
Of course,

00:01:32.433 --> 00:01:35.176
the idea of you and I
being friends is absurd.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.509
But I entered the school and Diamond 6
through Hanmyeong Scholarship Foundation,

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:43.576
so I thought there might
be some significance.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.132
Okay.

00:01:46.598 --> 00:01:47.576
Huh?

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.700
You do the speech.

00:01:54.367 --> 00:01:55.764
Thanks.

00:02:08.067 --> 00:02:11.502
It was pretty warm.

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:16.333
Yeah.

00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:19.067
That's a relief.

00:02:20.067 --> 00:02:22.409
I'll count on you

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:23.976
for the speech.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.615
But,

00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:28.500
I feel disappointed

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.600
that you said

00:02:32.333 --> 00:02:34.342
we're not friends.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.433
Ah...

00:02:42.467 --> 00:02:47.067
Then, I'll get going.

00:03:16.267 --> 00:03:18.143
And at that moment,

00:03:18.167 --> 00:03:21.567
I saw the person who pushed Kim Hae In.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.509
I was allowed

00:03:27.533 --> 00:03:31.443
to enter this school under the condition

00:03:31.467 --> 00:03:34.943
that I stay silent about
the culprit who pushed her.

00:03:34.967 --> 00:03:38.876
And within Cheongdam
International High School's.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.509
Diamond 6,

00:03:40.533 --> 00:03:42.809
there is a murderer

00:03:42.833 --> 00:03:45.167
who tried to kill Kim
Hae In by pushing her.

00:03:49.133 --> 00:03:53.133
The culprit who pushed
Kim Hae In is present today!

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.943
That criminal is none other than

00:03:55.967 --> 00:03:58.533
a member of Diamond 6,

00:04:15.667 --> 00:04:17.800
Min Yul Hee!

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:30.033
So it finally comes to this.

00:04:31.033 --> 00:04:32.576
You're digging your own grave.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.043
The culprit who tried to kill Kim
Hae In by pushing her from the rooftop

00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:37.343
is Min Yul Hee.

00:04:37.367 --> 00:04:39.709
Though Kim Hae In miraculously woke up,

00:04:39.733 --> 00:04:42.376
she was blackmailed by Min
Yul Hee with another video

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.176
and ultimately couldn't bear it any longer,

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.376
so she took her own life.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.709
Hey, Kim Hye In!

00:04:46.733 --> 00:04:49.343
Min Yul Hee used hidden camera footage

00:04:49.367 --> 00:04:54.133
to blackmail me into falsely testifying
that Baek Jenna was the murderer.

00:04:56.467 --> 00:05:00.343
Kim Hae in died

00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:02.433
right in front of me.

00:05:03.567 --> 00:05:06.143
She asked for help

00:05:06.167 --> 00:05:08.843
and said I was the only
one who could testify.

00:05:08.867 --> 00:05:10.943
But,

00:05:10.967 --> 00:05:13.676
because I hesitated,

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.643
Kim Hae In died because
of me... What should I do?

00:05:18.667 --> 00:05:20.767
Kim Hae In

00:05:21.733 --> 00:05:23.767
is dead?

00:05:25.633 --> 00:05:27.043
Min Yul Hee

00:05:27.067 --> 00:05:30.467
blackmailed me with my video.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.243
I'm sick of Min Yul Hee's blackmail

00:05:33.267 --> 00:05:37.209
and the Diamond 6 badge
you gave me. It's all disgusting.

00:05:37.233 --> 00:05:39.876
I'm going to reveal it all,

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.376
what Min Yul Hee did to me and Kim Hae In

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.876
and everything she has done so far.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.776
Min Yul Hee also

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.067
pushed Oh Si Eun

00:05:48.733 --> 00:05:51.109
from the rooftop.

00:05:51.133 --> 00:05:53.543
What the hell is that crazy girl saying?

00:05:53.567 --> 00:05:57.478
Stop her! Drag that lunatic off the stage!

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.443
Everything you've worked for,

00:06:00.467 --> 00:06:02.643
you'll lose it all.

00:06:02.667 --> 00:06:06.050
Your videos will spread
everywhere before this ends.

00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:08.595
Are you really okay with this?

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:11.494
It can't be worse than the current hell.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.609
Throw yourself into the pit you dug.

00:06:17.633 --> 00:06:19.500
Let's begin!

00:06:47.567 --> 00:06:50.343
If that's the case,

00:06:50.367 --> 00:06:53.233
there is someone who can help.

00:06:58.933 --> 00:07:01.309
Excuse me? Yul Hee is looking for you.

00:07:01.333 --> 00:07:03.967
She said the wrong video came out.

00:07:04.833 --> 00:07:07.676
Hello? The wrong video was released.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.609
- What?
- The wrong video was released.

00:07:11.633 --> 00:07:14.143
Yul Hee is looking for you over there.

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:17.709
She asked you to come
immediately. Hurry, hurry!

00:07:17.733 --> 00:07:19.109
Hurry up!

00:07:19.133 --> 00:07:21.100
Wait a moment.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.209
Hey, try opening the door.

00:07:30.233 --> 00:07:32.643
Gods. Even if you were paid,

00:07:32.667 --> 00:07:34.009
you shouldn't do this.

00:07:34.033 --> 00:07:35.867
Hey, you!

00:07:55.167 --> 00:07:59.309
With this, Min Yul Hee has violated the
Information and Communications Law.

00:07:59.333 --> 00:08:01.476
The illegal distribution
of hidden camera footage

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.543
is punishable by up to 10 years
imprisonment under the current law.

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:07.443
Min Yul Hee just violated the law herself,

00:08:07.467 --> 00:08:11.176
and illegally distributed the
footage recorded on that phone.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.109
I report Min Yul Hee as a
flagrante delicto offender.

00:08:15.133 --> 00:08:18.433
That trustworthy friend
you mentioned earlier...

00:08:23.033 --> 00:08:25.433
Hey, Baek Jenna.

00:08:26.333 --> 00:08:29.667
Don't worry. You can trust him.

00:08:30.533 --> 00:08:32.043
I roughly heard the story.

00:08:32.067 --> 00:08:34.143
What's the plan moving forward?

00:08:34.167 --> 00:08:38.476
First, I'll make Min Yul
Hee expose my footage.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.309
Then she'll be walking
into the trap instead.

00:08:42.333 --> 00:08:45.176
Hey, even so,

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.576
you'll end up having
all your videos exposed.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.976
I'm prepared for that.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.709
It'll stay with me for life,

00:08:51.733 --> 00:08:53.443
but there's no other way.

00:08:53.467 --> 00:08:55.743
Don't worry about that.

00:08:55.767 --> 00:08:57.343
I'll take care of it.

00:08:57.367 --> 00:09:00.167
Really? How?

00:09:02.367 --> 00:09:07.000
Using crawling-based AI to
erase all videos related to you.

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:11.909
Such technology exists?

00:09:11.933 --> 00:09:14.967
But how do you know about such things?

00:09:16.033 --> 00:09:19.267
His hobbies are a bit unusual.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.543
Don't tell me you're

00:09:25.567 --> 00:09:27.328
the Black Dog?

00:09:28.233 --> 00:09:30.876
And I called one more person.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.400
Can this one really be trusted?

00:09:38.767 --> 00:09:39.909
Lee Sa Rang?

00:09:39.933 --> 00:09:45.009
Moreover, there's conclusive evidence
that Min Yul Hee killed Kim Hae In.

00:09:45.033 --> 00:09:48.643
When Kim Hae In was dying in front of me,

00:09:48.667 --> 00:09:53.433
she gave me Min Yul Hee's necklace.

00:09:58.433 --> 00:10:00.876
Give me back the necklace Baek Jenna

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.643
gave you.

00:10:02.667 --> 00:10:05.409
Drag the student who entered out of here.

00:10:05.433 --> 00:10:07.776
I knew you'd do this.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.533
I never thought you'd
hand it over willingly either.

00:10:22.467 --> 00:10:24.243
Help me!

00:10:24.267 --> 00:10:26.509
Someone help me!

00:10:26.533 --> 00:10:28.243
Is anyone there?

00:10:28.267 --> 00:10:30.543
Help me!

00:10:30.567 --> 00:10:33.233
Why are you doing this?

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.233
Help me!

00:10:59.033 --> 00:11:01.933
This is exactly that necklace.

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:08.709
It's the evidence that Min
Yul Hee killed Kim Hae In.

00:11:08.733 --> 00:11:10.776
Though the school knew all this,

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.167
they covered everything up.

00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:22.204
That's all.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.243
We'll now begin the next show.

00:11:32.267 --> 00:11:35.943
Let's cut to the chase
and watch the screen.

00:11:35.967 --> 00:11:38.743
Hello everyone.

00:11:38.767 --> 00:11:40.733
Black Dog!

00:11:44.867 --> 00:11:46.843
Let me formally introduce myself.

00:11:46.867 --> 00:11:49.743
Not Cha Jin Wook of Chasel Medic,

00:11:49.767 --> 00:11:53.100
but Black Dog Cha Jin Wook.

00:11:54.533 --> 00:11:57.309
Let's all watch the video together.

00:11:57.333 --> 00:11:59.567
I'm Seo Hee Su.

00:12:02.433 --> 00:12:05.643
Seo Do Un, just do me one favor.

00:12:05.667 --> 00:12:07.509
Not for me,

00:12:07.533 --> 00:12:10.167
but for the deceased Kim Hae In.

00:12:10.933 --> 00:12:14.309
We need Chairman Seo Hee Su's testimony.

00:12:14.333 --> 00:12:16.743
I testified that Kim Hae
In committed suicide,

00:12:16.767 --> 00:12:19.776
and in exchange, I transferred schools.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.767
That should suffice.

00:12:22.633 --> 00:12:24.643
I don't care.

00:12:24.667 --> 00:12:26.598
About anything.

00:12:26.622 --> 00:12:28.249
Now,

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.176
I'll set everything straight.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.443
Regarding Kim Hae In's fall incident,

00:12:33.467 --> 00:12:35.776
I was the one who approved

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.076
Kim Hye In's admission

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.109
in exchange for concealing the truth.

00:12:40.133 --> 00:12:41.543
And

00:12:41.567 --> 00:12:44.809
I also confess about framing
Kim Hae In's murder as suicide

00:12:44.833 --> 00:12:48.509
and accepting Kim Hye In.

00:12:48.533 --> 00:12:49.776
Are you insane?

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.567
Don't you realize what will
happen to this school if you do that?

00:12:54.633 --> 00:12:55.643
Therefore,

00:12:55.667 --> 00:12:57.576
do you want to go down together?

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.667
Or exit honorably?

00:13:00.367 --> 00:13:03.343
Before the name of Cheongdam
International High School,

00:13:03.367 --> 00:13:07.376
I will take responsibility to the end,

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:11.343
face the heavy responsibility
and pay for my sins,

00:13:11.367 --> 00:13:14.900
without avoiding the
price for this incident.

00:13:18.567 --> 00:13:20.400
Once again,

00:13:21.067 --> 00:13:24.033
I offer my deepest apologies.

00:13:27.567 --> 00:13:30.667
You bastard! Won't you turn it off now?

00:13:31.933 --> 00:13:34.443
This violates the promise you made me!

00:13:34.467 --> 00:13:35.743
What are you?

00:13:35.767 --> 00:13:37.109
Hey, Kim Jin Sang!

00:13:37.133 --> 00:13:40.057
Go to the control room
and turn this off immediately!

00:13:43.824 --> 00:13:45.051
Hey!

00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:46.921
That bastard!

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.709
Next on the agenda,

00:13:58.733 --> 00:14:01.343
there were extremely dirty and vile deeds

00:14:01.367 --> 00:14:03.943
between Cheongdam International High School

00:14:03.967 --> 00:14:06.376
and Chasel Medic's shady dealings.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.543
What the hell are you doing now?

00:14:08.567 --> 00:14:10.909
Oh! Mr. Chairman!

00:14:10.933 --> 00:14:12.876
I'm on a business trip abroad.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.909
Ah, Chairman Cha!

00:14:14.933 --> 00:14:19.243
We successfully acquired shares
through Baek Jenna's drug case.

00:14:19.267 --> 00:14:23.376
We dropped the stock price with
that incident and bought it cheaply.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:27.109
We increased our shares
by posing as foreign investors.

00:14:27.133 --> 00:14:30.976
Ah, I see. Congratulations!

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.909
Hello.

00:14:32.933 --> 00:14:38.776
Hello!

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.876
Then, we should make our move now.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.443
Just wait a little longer.

00:14:43.467 --> 00:14:47.643
This time instead of his daughter,
we'll target Chairman Baek

00:14:47.667 --> 00:14:51.560
with a filthy sex scandal.

00:14:52.667 --> 00:14:55.009
I look forward to it.

00:14:55.033 --> 00:14:58.409
After completely destroying
the company with owner risk,

00:14:58.433 --> 00:15:00.876
Cha Jin Wook will step forward as the face.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:05.176
Then we'll discard Cha Jin Wook through
drugs or similar means, just like Baek Jenna.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.776
We'll discard him afterward.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.676
Yes, you've handled it well.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.576
I'll call again then.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.676
Yes, goodbye.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.176
What the hell are you doing
right now? You crazy bastard!

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.709
What kind of cheap trick is this?

00:15:19.733 --> 00:15:22.900
Are you insane? What's this nonsense?

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.309
Chairman Cha Ki Ho of Chasel Medic

00:15:26.333 --> 00:15:28.476
planned to devour Hanmyeong Holdings

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.876
and this engagement was just the beginning.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.276
Chairman Cha Ki Ho of Chasel
Medic and Chairman Seo Hee Kwon

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.943
illegally secured shares,

00:15:34.967 --> 00:15:36.009
manipulated stock prices,

00:15:36.033 --> 00:15:37.576
and even violated private school laws.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.400
Everything was part of
their predetermined scheme.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.609
What kind of scam are you pulling?

00:15:48.633 --> 00:15:49.643
You bastard really

00:15:49.667 --> 00:15:50.843
Mr. Chairman,

00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:52.843
the reporters are watching.

00:15:52.867 --> 00:15:54.976
Please smile a bit.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.109
Mr. Chairman.

00:15:56.133 --> 00:15:59.009
I'm SBN Reporter Lee Ho Jong.

00:15:59.033 --> 00:16:02.243
The information spread through
Black Dog Channel has all been true.

00:16:02.267 --> 00:16:03.676
Could you give us a statement?

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.276
SBN's Lee Ho Jong, you bastard!

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.309
The chairman is hitting a reporter!

00:16:08.333 --> 00:16:09.609
- This is assault!
- Hurry!

00:16:09.633 --> 00:16:11.676
Hey, film this! Film it!

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:12.709
He's hitting a reporter!

00:16:12.733 --> 00:16:14.309
Darn it, move aside!

00:16:14.333 --> 00:16:15.976
- Mr. Chairman!
- Mr. Chairman!

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.467
Please give us a comment, Mr. Chairman.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:20.909
- Stop them!
- Mr. Chairman!

00:16:20.933 --> 00:16:22.967
I said stop them!

00:16:28.267 --> 00:16:30.376
Beyond the corruption I just mentioned,

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.043
Chairman Cha Ki Ho and
Chairman Seo Hee Kwon

00:16:32.067 --> 00:16:35.133
even used borrowed-name
accounts for slush funds.

00:16:36.167 --> 00:16:37.768
It's astonishing!

00:16:37.792 --> 00:16:41.858
Now let's watch the final video together.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.176
I am Park Woo Jin.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.809
All this time,

00:16:45.833 --> 00:16:49.976
I've been gaslighted by Min Yul Hee.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.009
On the day Oh Si Eun died,

00:16:52.033 --> 00:16:53.976
she told me

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.243
to kill Oh Si Eun.

00:16:56.267 --> 00:16:58.576
She said those words.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.776
And then she told me

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.367
to just die too.

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.743
Hey! Park Woo Jin!

00:17:23.767 --> 00:17:25.576
You crazy bastard!

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.309
What the hell is that, you lunatic?

00:17:27.333 --> 00:17:29.143
It's true, isn't it?

00:17:29.167 --> 00:17:32.343
You pushed Oh Si Eun
that day, saying you'd kill her.

00:17:32.367 --> 00:17:33.943
You killed Kim Hae In too,

00:17:33.967 --> 00:17:35.576
and said the second one
wasn't even a real case.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.943
What nonsense is this, you madman!

00:17:37.967 --> 00:17:40.476
Hey! You crazy bastard!
How could you do this to me?

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.876
- Calm down!
- Hey!

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.349
How could you do this to me?

00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:49.838
Hey, Park Woo Jin.

00:17:49.862 --> 00:17:53.396
I know you're the one who killed Oh Si Eun.

00:17:54.533 --> 00:17:58.609
- Are you insane?
- And I know you didn't do it intentionally.

00:17:58.633 --> 00:18:01.800
Min Yul Hee ordered you to do it.

00:18:03.033 --> 00:18:04.643
You just need to testify.

00:18:04.667 --> 00:18:09.000
You've been gaslighted
by Min Yul Hee all along.

00:18:14.333 --> 00:18:16.009
What are you doing?

00:18:16.033 --> 00:18:17.243
Hey!

00:18:17.267 --> 00:18:18.909
You recorded this, didn't you?

00:18:18.933 --> 00:18:22.376
Darn it! Do I look that stupid to you?

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.776
Recording? I didn't do any of that.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.109
Then what the hell is this about?

00:18:27.133 --> 00:18:30.509
There was no CCTV, nothing at all that day.

00:18:30.533 --> 00:18:32.676
I was the only witness.

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.076
You just need to testify that Min Yul Hee

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.243
went to find Oh Si Eun that
day and threatened to kill her.

00:18:38.267 --> 00:18:41.509
I'll testify that Min Yul Hee

00:18:41.533 --> 00:18:43.976
was the one who killed Kim Hae In.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.043
You'll say Min Yul Hee pushed Kim Hae In?

00:18:46.067 --> 00:18:48.843
I have to do it that way.

00:18:48.867 --> 00:18:53.967
You're responsible for Kim Hae In's death.

00:19:00.433 --> 00:19:02.643
No, actually I

00:19:02.667 --> 00:19:04.609
I've been tormented by that, you know.

00:19:04.633 --> 00:19:07.776
I haven't slept a wink since yesterday.

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.009
I'm not that much of a monster.

00:19:11.033 --> 00:19:12.909
I know, Park Woo Jin.

00:19:12.933 --> 00:19:17.243
So this time, you must step forward.

00:19:17.267 --> 00:19:18.909
I'll kill all of you.

00:19:18.933 --> 00:19:20.809
I'll kill everyone! Hey!

00:19:20.833 --> 00:19:24.243
Let go!

00:19:24.267 --> 00:19:26.467
I won't let this slide!

00:19:27.733 --> 00:19:30.167
You're all pathetic.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:32.709
Wait, but.

00:19:32.733 --> 00:19:36.209
Seo Do Un won't forgive me either.

00:19:36.233 --> 00:19:39.909
I'll convince Seo Do Un.

00:19:39.933 --> 00:19:42.076
The responsibility for Kim Hae In's death

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.476
lies with me too.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.333
Right.

00:19:47.133 --> 00:19:49.300
I also want to

00:19:50.733 --> 00:19:53.133
shake it all off now.

00:19:54.267 --> 00:19:56.143
And

00:19:56.167 --> 00:19:58.309
never forgive Park Woo Jin.

00:19:58.333 --> 00:20:00.509
He's the murderer who killed Oh Si Eun,

00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:04.243
and the decisive reason
Kim Hae In ended up like that.

00:20:04.267 --> 00:20:06.043
Never.

00:20:06.067 --> 00:20:09.933
Never forgive him.

00:20:29.567 --> 00:20:31.676
This bastard...

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.500
You!

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.676
Acquiring that must
have cost a lot of funds.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.933
How will you cover that?

00:20:42.567 --> 00:20:45.843
You should've stuck to being a loan shark.

00:20:45.867 --> 00:20:48.143
Why try to imitate a
conglomerate unnecessarily?

00:20:48.167 --> 00:20:49.776
Why are you doing this?

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.909
- Why are you doing this?
- Father!

00:20:52.933 --> 00:20:54.767
No.

00:20:55.433 --> 00:20:56.976
Chairman Cha Ki Ho, listen carefully.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.409
Don't seek reasons from others.

00:20:59.433 --> 00:21:01.543
Reflect on the life you've lived.

00:21:01.567 --> 00:21:04.043
Including all the things you've done

00:21:04.067 --> 00:21:06.333
to me and my mother until now.

00:21:07.833 --> 00:21:09.843
Regarding the fake-name
accounts and slush funds,

00:21:09.867 --> 00:21:13.309
I donated everything to the UN.

00:21:13.333 --> 00:21:15.500
You've done a good deed!

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.467
You crazy bastard.

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:22.009
Do you think I'll let you get away?

00:21:22.033 --> 00:21:24.243
Your bluffs

00:21:24.267 --> 00:21:28.833
will completely crush you at Hanmyeong.

00:21:30.333 --> 00:21:32.143
Oh!

00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:33.676
Chairman Baek,

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:37.000
that punk holds a grudge against me.

00:21:38.767 --> 00:21:40.443
So I've learned my lesson from this.

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:44.343
We'll see each other
often in court from now on.

00:21:44.367 --> 00:21:46.143
Chairman Baek!

00:21:46.167 --> 00:21:49.267
Ugh, seriously!

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.833
Wait, did he just...

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.676
You bastard!

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.100
This punk!

00:22:06.667 --> 00:22:08.876
You crazy bastard!

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:10.709
Hey, you! Come here!

00:22:10.733 --> 00:22:12.900
Come here, you punk!

00:22:13.967 --> 00:22:15.476
Cha Jin Wook!

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.300
Cha Jin...

00:22:50.767 --> 00:22:52.209
How does it feel to lose?

00:22:52.233 --> 00:22:53.343
Disgusting, right?

00:22:53.367 --> 00:22:55.343
What scheme are you pulling?

00:22:55.367 --> 00:22:56.676
You have no evidence.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.076
You think that necklace counts as evidence?

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.543
I'll testify,

00:23:00.567 --> 00:23:02.043
and Park Woo Jin will too.

00:23:02.067 --> 00:23:05.485
Plus, you're guilty of spreading
hidden camera footage.

00:23:05.509 --> 00:23:09.181
Be glad you weren't caught in the act.

00:23:12.392 --> 00:23:15.909
Back then, instead of Kim Hae In,
you should've just dropped dead.

00:23:15.933 --> 00:23:17.643
You crazy girl!

00:23:17.667 --> 00:23:19.176
Let go!

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.576
You better book a flight ticket quickly.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.009
Even though you're a minor,

00:23:24.033 --> 00:23:25.676
your crimes are too heinous.

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:28.633
Fleeing far away would be the best option.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.043
You think it's all over?

00:23:32.067 --> 00:23:34.309
You think I'll let a leech
like you defeat me?

00:23:34.333 --> 00:23:36.209
Don't be mistaken.

00:23:36.233 --> 00:23:37.943
Nothing will change.

00:23:37.967 --> 00:23:41.509
Absolutely nothing will change!

00:23:41.533 --> 00:23:43.433
Yul Hee, let's go.

00:24:12.433 --> 00:24:14.667
Impressive, Kim Hye In.

00:24:16.633 --> 00:24:18.443
I couldn't do it twice.

00:24:18.467 --> 00:24:22.076
Anyway, I have to admit your
survival skills are top-notch.

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.514
It's because you all helped.

00:24:25.367 --> 00:24:27.267
Mr. Kim.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.367
Huh? Dad.

00:24:39.267 --> 00:24:41.480
It's all settled now, right?

00:24:41.504 --> 00:24:42.776
Hey!

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.943
Did you see the chairman fleeing earlier?

00:24:44.967 --> 00:24:48.067
His face was fine, so why did he do that?

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.209
I'm so hungry now.

00:24:54.233 --> 00:24:56.709
Sisters, shall we go
eat something delicious?

00:24:56.733 --> 00:24:58.143
Tteokbokki?

00:24:58.167 --> 00:25:00.376
My treat.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.843
You three go celebrate.

00:25:02.867 --> 00:25:04.943
I still have things to do.

00:25:04.967 --> 00:25:06.176
Where are you going?

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.597
Me?

00:25:09.867 --> 00:25:11.933
You'll find out later.

00:25:27.833 --> 00:25:29.143
Baek Jenna,

00:25:29.167 --> 00:25:31.609
why are you acting so recklessly?

00:25:31.633 --> 00:25:32.776
Dad,

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.209
Cha Jin Wook

00:25:34.233 --> 00:25:36.709
transferred all his shares to me.

00:25:36.733 --> 00:25:39.109
And to commemorate my
engagement, my stepmother

00:25:39.133 --> 00:25:41.243
also transferred

00:25:41.267 --> 00:25:45.176
all the shares you gifted her to me.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.100
What? What?

00:25:47.733 --> 00:25:50.343
What can I do?

00:25:50.367 --> 00:25:52.043
Jenna, please!

00:25:52.067 --> 00:25:55.400
Please, Jenna!

00:26:14.933 --> 00:26:17.176
The company shares you received from my dad

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.876
should be transferred to me.

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:23.809
Then this matter will
remain a secret forever.

00:26:23.833 --> 00:26:26.300
And though it's not much, percentage-wise,

00:26:26.933 --> 00:26:29.076
there's another person
who left shares to me.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.843
What nonsense are you spouting now?

00:26:30.867 --> 00:26:33.943
I thought you might feel left out if
I didn't invite you to this occasion,

00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:35.876
so I called Mom.

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:37.700
What? Mom?

00:26:42.733 --> 00:26:44.867
Long time no see.

00:26:48.967 --> 00:26:51.267
Congratulations, Jenna.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.576
What's there to congratulate?

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.443
I already ruined the engagement.

00:26:56.467 --> 00:26:58.243
Well, actually,

00:26:58.267 --> 00:26:59.776
Jenna has become

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:03.209
the major shareholder of Hanmyeong.

00:27:03.233 --> 00:27:04.809
What? What major shareholder?

00:27:04.833 --> 00:27:08.443
With Mom's shares combined,
I'm now the major shareholder.

00:27:08.467 --> 00:27:09.643
Mom's shares?

00:27:09.667 --> 00:27:11.243
You people are really...

00:27:11.267 --> 00:27:13.943
Hey, do you even realize what you're doing?

00:27:13.967 --> 00:27:15.943
You should now

00:27:15.967 --> 00:27:17.943
start a new life comfortably.

00:27:17.967 --> 00:27:21.609
Group operations... will be handled by me.

00:27:21.633 --> 00:27:22.776
You were really weak, weren't you?

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.809
- Are you crazy?
- No.

00:27:24.833 --> 00:27:26.143
I'm perfectly sane.

00:27:26.167 --> 00:27:29.233
You're the one who's not in his right mind.

00:27:29.867 --> 00:27:32.643
Someone who can't even
care for their closest family,

00:27:32.667 --> 00:27:34.509
how can they manage a group?

00:27:34.533 --> 00:27:36.976
Just enjoy operating the remaining resorts

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.709
and have a good time.

00:27:38.733 --> 00:27:40.876
You two should enjoy cozy moments together.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.143
You darn kid!

00:27:42.167 --> 00:27:44.209
Oh, and

00:27:44.233 --> 00:27:47.276
the sponsorships for Cheongdam
High and Hanmyeong Group

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.576
will be discontinued.

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.109
You've truly gone completely mad?

00:27:50.133 --> 00:27:51.967
Dad,

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:53.909
in a few days,

00:27:53.933 --> 00:27:56.676
there will be a board meeting.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.567
I'll see you then.

00:27:59.467 --> 00:28:01.267
Let's go.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.576
Hey, Baek Jenna!

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.433
Baek Jenna!

00:28:12.333 --> 00:28:15.633
You were in it too? Huh?

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:23.000
You're not coming?

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.809
Darn it! I thought about acting...

00:29:21.833 --> 00:29:25.133
Those brats all got fooled, darn it.

00:29:28.467 --> 00:29:29.976
Let's go, kids.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.200
Let's go.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.243
Will you go meet your mother?

00:29:56.267 --> 00:29:57.976
Yeah.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.143
I'll be taking care of her for now.

00:30:00.167 --> 00:30:02.533
I heard from Driver Hong

00:30:03.167 --> 00:30:04.176
that it was you.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.300
Ah, that...

00:30:07.533 --> 00:30:10.609
Well, it was part of the plan.

00:30:10.633 --> 00:30:12.567
The bravado...

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.409
This is my final gift.

00:30:17.433 --> 00:30:19.143
Travel comfortably to Hong Kong.

00:30:19.167 --> 00:30:21.109
First class is excessive,

00:30:21.133 --> 00:30:23.100
so I got you business class.

00:30:25.867 --> 00:30:28.076
You've worked hard.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:30.233
I'm not going to Hong Kong.

00:30:31.233 --> 00:30:34.943
With Chairman Cha around,
I'll be lying low for a while.

00:30:34.967 --> 00:30:37.109
Don't come looking for me if you miss me.

00:30:37.133 --> 00:30:38.843
Then,

00:30:38.867 --> 00:30:41.309
you won't come back?

00:30:41.333 --> 00:30:44.209
I'm not sure.

00:30:44.233 --> 00:30:45.409
Why?

00:30:45.433 --> 00:30:47.733
Will you get me a job at Hanmyeong?

00:30:48.918 --> 00:30:50.681
I'll consider it.

00:30:51.467 --> 00:30:53.576
Ah, never mind.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.443
I need you.

00:30:55.467 --> 00:30:58.233
The real war starts now.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.653
Jenna,

00:31:01.333 --> 00:31:02.876
you can do this.

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:07.233
The Baek Jenna I know
can handle everything alone.

00:31:10.533 --> 00:31:12.176
Thanks.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.400
That seemed sincere.

00:31:23.333 --> 00:31:25.533
And you're not alone.

00:31:35.033 --> 00:31:37.733
The bus is here. I'll go.

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:27.609
Welcome.

00:33:27.633 --> 00:33:28.843
What?

00:33:28.867 --> 00:33:30.109
Baek Jenna?

00:33:30.133 --> 00:33:31.376
May I sit?

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:35.467
Of course. As the leader of
Hanmyeong Group, please sit.

00:33:36.167 --> 00:33:37.809
What's the matter?

00:33:37.833 --> 00:33:40.576
I'll get straight to the point.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.476
Work with me.

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.543
I'm not interested.

00:33:45.567 --> 00:33:47.643
I'm going to college.

00:33:47.667 --> 00:33:51.400
And I'll join the company with confidence.

00:33:52.267 --> 00:33:54.667
I knew you'd say something like that.
