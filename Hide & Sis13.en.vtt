WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.696
You must be the one who killed Chat.

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.432
I didn’t kill her!

00:00:03.464 --> 00:00:06.936
You’re here to find out the truth about your dad

00:00:06.968 --> 00:00:08.940
and now, you know everything.

00:00:08.968 --> 00:00:12.240
So the two of us no longer need to stay together

00:00:12.272 --> 00:00:14.240
Please don’t be angry at me.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.816
Eat up!

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:17.976
Don’t f*cking bother my sisters.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.140
What are you doing in here?

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.856
I’m sorry.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.260
I…

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.664
I thought you went out.

00:00:44.696 --> 00:00:47.776
So I came in to clean the room.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.352
My friend came to visit me last night.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.280
We had a bit too much to drink.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.632
So I got up late today.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.776
I’ll come back
when you finish getting dressed.

00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:04.300
Mr. Asok has been busy with work.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.920
He has a lot of stress because of it.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.520
He won’t be home much.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.920
Yes.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.512
Don’t bother him with unnecessary things.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.900
Here.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.904
I just hung out with my friend
and enjoyed the wine.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.032
It’s not something

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.728
that Mr. Asok needs to know, right?

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.248
Mr. Asok often told me.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.344
He trusts me to take care of this house.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.184
I need to tell him everything
that happens in the house.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.456
No matter what it is or who it’s concerned.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.328
Does it include…

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.696
your habit of secretly wearing my clothes

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.128
and walking around the house?

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.448
As if…

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.816
you were the lady of the house.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.840
I get it.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.752
Every woman,

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.552
We all want a rich husband

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.640
who can provide a comfortable life for us.

00:02:31.328 --> 00:02:32.792
I’m also a woman.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.768
I get it.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.792
But I’m not sure

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.472
if Mr. Asok will understand it.

00:02:43.168 --> 00:02:45.170
If one day he finds out

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.624
that his maid…

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.984
who has been taking care of his house and kids,

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.496
she has this secret ambition.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.792
I can’t imagine

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.576
how he would react.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.184
You should stick to the job you are good at.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.824
Cleaning up the house.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.380
Pi.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.350
Bua.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.048
Come and help me with her.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.050
Picha.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.968
Pi.

00:03:46.008 --> 00:03:47.008
Pi.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.800
What did she put in her tea?

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.272
I don’t know.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:53.610
Old witch.

00:03:53.696 --> 00:03:55.460
What did you put in her tea?

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.136
Hello, Tina.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.860
What?

00:04:08.512 --> 00:04:10.510
Hold on. I can’t hear you.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.400
Hello?

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.656
You bitches.

00:04:43.688 --> 00:04:45.104
Buntharika.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.408
Chompoonuch, Pudpichaya, Chatfah.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.120
You think you are the flowers
of Bupphachat Mansion, right?

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.048
But the truth is that you are insects
swarming around rotten garbage.

00:05:00.088 --> 00:05:01.640
You’re not superior to others.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.100
Tell me.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.240
What the hell did you put in her tea?

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.368
It’s pesticide.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.904
I wanted your parents to see

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.176
how screwed up their daughters are.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.320
Why the fuck did you do this to us?

00:05:28.352 --> 00:05:29.512
What have we ever done to you?

00:05:29.536 --> 00:05:33.048
You are living in an ivory tower.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.050
You didn’t know anything.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.560
Mrs. Fai died because of you guys.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.384
Parn ended up like this because of you.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.568
Many people lost everything

00:05:47.384 --> 00:05:49.176
because of your family.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.456
It serves you right.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.104
Damn, what the hell is she talking about?

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:56.740
Pi.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.280
Pi.

00:05:58.312 --> 00:05:59.080
Pi.

00:05:59.112 --> 00:06:00.864
Let’s take her to the hospital.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.400
Pi.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.960
Pi.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.224
Picha.

00:06:09.232 --> 00:06:10.232
Pi.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.072
(People whom we love)

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.432
(they can hurt us more than those who hate us.)

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.552
(The more we love them)

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.520
(The less we should trust them.)

00:06:24.552 --> 00:06:25.680
You can’t come in.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.760
I’ll take care of her.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.800
Okay.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.664
(Because a serpent, )

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.624
Yes, Captain.

00:06:39.648 --> 00:06:43.064
(it’s not as scary as a friend who betrays you.)

00:06:43.088 --> 00:06:44.608
Aunty Chom is still there, right?

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.610
Yes, she’s still here.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.832
She is the one
who killed Uncle Kajorn and Chat.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.528
(If you are bitten by them,
no serum can heal you.)

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.016
We need to investigate it further.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.296
But…

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.416
I’m afraid we won’t get any info from her.

00:07:09.456 --> 00:07:11.912
(Only death is waiting for us.)

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.840
Here.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:28.000
I can’t believe Aunty Chom killed herself
to run away from her crimes.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.384
I was worried about Pi.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.744
So I forgot that we should keep an eye on her
until the police arrived.

00:08:34.768 --> 00:08:37.049
No one would think about it
if they were in our situation.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.872
I can’t believe it.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.608
Aunty Chom was the murderer.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.856
I almost let her get away with her crimes.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.568
I think…

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.824
she might not be the murderer.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:49.630
Excuse me.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:52.192
If it wasn’t her, who else could it be?

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:56.080
She almost got me into the ICU with Pi.

00:08:56.112 --> 00:08:57.240
I know.

00:08:57.288 --> 00:08:59.432
I know that she hated us.

00:08:59.472 --> 00:09:01.160
But Chat’s attack,

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:03.920
I don’t think she did it.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.144
If it’s not her.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:10.808
Is it you?

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:15.920
Hey.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.408
You haven’t told me.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.712
Where have you been
since Uncle Kajorn was killed?

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.704
I have my reason to run away.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.656
Then tell me your reason right now.

00:09:26.696 --> 00:09:28.660
Otherwise, I’ll get you arrested.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.424
Aunty Chom also sabotaged me.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.984
She switched my medication,
and my sleepwalking got worse.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.544
I sleepwalked to where Uncle Kajorn was.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.448
But when I found him,

00:09:43.648 --> 00:09:45.910
he was already dead.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.152
Do you remember Mangkorn?

00:09:51.176 --> 00:09:52.768
Mangkorn from Chat’s journal.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.320
His name is Arch.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:57.048
He saved me.

00:09:57.072 --> 00:09:58.240
He took care of me.

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.752
He helped me
investigate things that happened.

00:10:01.776 --> 00:10:02.776
Wait.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.104
You trust him?

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.400
I trusted him at first.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:09.660
Until…

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.696
There’s one thing you need to know.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:18.980
What is it?

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.312
Miss Pudpichaya’s family,
the doctor wants to see you.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.760
Pi’s condition is now out of danger.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.632
The doctor said she was lucky
that she only took a small sip of the tea.

00:10:37.648 --> 00:10:39.408
They gave her an antidote.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.552
Where is Baibua?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.640
You told me she was back.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.072
She said she would cooperate with the police.

00:11:03.104 --> 00:11:05.240
She’s talking to the doctor right now.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.992
I’m sorry about this.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.152
I never thought it would be
someone close to us like Aunty Chom.

00:11:13.472 --> 00:11:15.470
I have one more thing I need to tell you.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:17.860
Um…

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.560
When Chain and I were on our way
to Bupphachat Mansion,

00:11:21.864 --> 00:11:23.860
we received a call.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:30.712
You, check that way.

00:11:30.728 --> 00:11:31.728
Yes.

00:11:34.088 --> 00:11:36.936
We believe that he ran his truck
into a tree on the side of the road.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.760
Mr. Thana was found dead at the scene.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.664
Headquarters, we found a dead driver.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:47.160
We think the accident happened
around the time you took Picha to the hospital.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:14.880
Chom.

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:17.472
Are you okay?

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.576
I stayed at my apartment last night.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.032
So I wasn’t here.

00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:46.432
Yes.

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:56.930
Miss Parn.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.280
Where were you when this happened?

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:09.240
I took a sleeping pill.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.320
I was sleeping in my room.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:20.400
No matter how many times we face a loss,
we don’t seem to get used to it.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.944
I’m ready to fully cooperate with the police.

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:42.304
I will also tell you where I was all this time.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:46.744
You said you ran away to avoid
being a suspect in Mr. Kajorn’s death, right?

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:49.250
Yes.

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:55.872
I was investigating everything that happened
to prove my innocence.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.896
You found everything in this flash drive
by yourself?

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.656
No, someone helped me.

00:14:08.952 --> 00:14:12.400
He’s Chatfah’s half-brother.

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.090
Hello.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:29.376
We contacted the deceased’s family
living in another province.

00:14:29.416 --> 00:14:31.144
They will come to receive his body this evening.

00:14:31.168 --> 00:14:32.176
Thank you.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:36.320
When his family arrives, can you call me?

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.736
What was your relationship with Mr. Thana?

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.656
I was his friend, his close friend.

00:14:43.688 --> 00:14:44.816
Sure.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.248
Excuse me, are you Mr. Thana’s friend?

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:55.230
Yes.

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:56.808
Why, Officer?

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.824
I was informed
that the suspect in my case was dead.

00:14:59.856 --> 00:15:02.296
So I came here to confirm it.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.784
The suspect?

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:06.656
What do you mean?

00:15:06.688 --> 00:15:13.184
Mr. Thana Satratawee was suspected
of killing the witness in the Black Fairy fire.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.568
How did he become the suspect?

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:21.552
A CCTV camera captured him
entering the hospital.

00:15:21.784 --> 00:15:23.608
He was disguised as a nurse.

00:15:23.648 --> 00:15:25.160
He went into the witness’s room.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.016
Shortly after that, the witness died.

00:15:38.128 --> 00:15:39.128
Khem.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.300
Picha.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.360
How are you feeling?

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:44.376
Do you have any pain?

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:51.936
I was so scared.

00:15:53.848 --> 00:15:55.608
I’m fine now.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.976
You don’t need to say anything.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.360
Can we stay like this for a while?

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.896
Things are coming to an end.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.980
Sarah’s friend will gain consciousness soon.

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:21.808
Then the police will know

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.584
that I started the fire at the nightclub.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:27.408
If I can help you on this,

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:29.616
will l…

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.944
be ahead of Nathat?

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.208
What medicine is that?

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.536
It’s my medicine.

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:36.552
POTASSIUM CHLORIDE IS USED
TO TREAT HYPOKALEMIA
FROM SEVERE DIARRHEA OR VOMITING.

00:18:55.712 --> 00:18:56.712
Captain.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.544
I’m here to search Mr. Thana’s house.

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.000
What’s going on?

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.120
You aren’t in charge of the Black Fairy fire case.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:15.390
No.

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:17.968
I’m here because of Miss Chomchai’s murder.

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:20.168
Murder?

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:22.760
But she killed herself, didn’t she?

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:28.176
We found many abnormalities
in the rope knots and her autopsy.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.264
More importantly, we found fingerprints
and footprints at the crime scene.

00:19:32.288 --> 00:19:35.328
They belonged to Mr. Thana,
who should not have been there.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:41.944
It’s highly possible that
he sneaked into the house after you left.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.008
I’m not sure
if this is a side effect of the medication.

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:55.792
When I woke up,

00:19:56.984 --> 00:19:58.980
I didn’t remember anything.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.200
It felt like a dream to me.

00:20:04.504 --> 00:20:06.500
Which part do you not remember?

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.032
The poisoning.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.896
I remember drinking the tea.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.400
Then I felt like I was dreaming.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.520
But from what Chom told me,

00:20:23.128 --> 00:20:25.920
she said I was half awake.

00:20:25.952 --> 00:20:27.920
I wasn’t unconscious.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.672
But when I woke up,
I didn’t remember anything.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:37.888
I didn’t remember
if anyone did something to me.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.200
It’s likely a side effect of the medication.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.680
That’s what I thought at first.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.280
But this is not the first time it happened to me.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:56.616
Sometimes, I lose memories of a certain moment.

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:01.176
I can’t remember
what happened in those moments.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.472
Has this happened to you before?

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:12.768
How is it?

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.220
It’s from the forensic science center.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.952
They’ve identified the remains found at the farm.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.896
But we searched the crime records database
and didn’t find a match.

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:28.250
Yes.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.608
What if this person
has never been reported missing?

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.940
Then we won’t find her name in the database.

00:21:36.784 --> 00:21:39.392
So this person…

00:21:39.416 --> 00:21:42.088
It’s likely that she is assumed to be alive

00:21:42.128 --> 00:21:43.568
after she ran away with another man.

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:46.090
That’s why no one reported her
as a missing person.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:52.768
So I searched the list of people
who left the farm during that time.

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:55.176
Send the remains for a DNA test.

00:21:55.216 --> 00:21:57.920
Inform her relative to come in for a DNA test.

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:00.432
This is the result.

00:22:06.736 --> 00:22:08.740
It’s someone we never imagined, right?

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.872
Thank you, Chompoo,

00:22:14.896 --> 00:22:16.768
for contacting me from time to time.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:20.088
I still miss Sarah.

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:23.552
Sure.

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:27.576
How is Sarah’s case going?

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:29.984
I know the truth about everything.

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:33.592
I know who started the fire.

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:41.304
How did you find out?

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:45.672
Sarah’s friend told me

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:49.832
Sarah’s friend told me
after he gained consciousness and before he died.

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:57.848
Now, the police know…

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:03.304
that Sarah started the fire.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:06.424
What?

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:09.792
Stop playing hard to get.

00:23:09.824 --> 00:23:11.336
I know you are easy.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.320
It’s good that my injury is not serious.

00:23:22.352 --> 00:23:25.080
Damn it. There’s a camera here.

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:27.584
What if she reports it to the police?

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:57.024
Sarah, what the hell are you doing?

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.816
I’m going to burn everything.

00:23:58.896 --> 00:24:00.820
So there will be no evidence left.

00:24:00.848 --> 00:24:01.904
If we are asked about it,

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.584
we just blame it on Chompoo.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:07.580
Sarah, you are nuts.

00:24:17.784 --> 00:24:19.648
What the heck?!

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:21.810
Sarah.

00:24:22.496 --> 00:24:23.096
Sarah.

00:24:23.128 --> 00:24:23.980
Sarah.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Sarah.

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:29.800
Shit. Help me.

00:24:31.568 --> 00:24:32.580
Help.

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:36.080
I’m very sorry.

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:41.968
I never thought she would be the cause
of other people’s deaths.

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:53.720
The person who started the fire
at the nightclub that night is Sarah?

00:25:10.864 --> 00:25:12.860
I heard about your house helper.

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:17.856
Did you get hurt?

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.040
No.

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:25.176
I’m fine.

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.600
Do you think she attacked Chatfah?

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:35.064
She switched my medication.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.800
She tried to frame Chom and poisoned Pi.

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:44.064
She hated us enough to kill us
because she held grudges against my dad.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.952
Everything is pointing that she did it, but…

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:52.384
I’m still unsure.

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:53.860
Why?

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.368
I don’t know.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.480
I don’t have a particular reason.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:05.568
Anyway, I need to be strong.

00:26:06.336 --> 00:26:08.340
So my sisters can lean on me.

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.368
You are their big sister.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.848
But don’t forget

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.512
that you are also a human.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.488
It’s okay to be weak sometimes.

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.384
You don’t need to be strong all the time.

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:36.056
If my dad were still here,

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.752
he would say the opposite.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:47.440
Your dad might love you more than you think.

00:26:49.752 --> 00:26:51.750
Chatfah told me

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:55.528
that the will that you saw was a new one.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:59.568
It was written recently.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:09.740
There’s a chance that
his old will may be somewhere in the mansion.

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:16.910
Bua.

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:23.344
This is probably the last time we meet.

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:28.392
I know the truth about everything.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:35.400
I no longer have a reason to stay here.

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:41.690
Hey.

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.272
Take care of yourself, okay?

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:22.000
It’s my fault.

00:28:26.728 --> 00:28:28.730
I told him I started the fire.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:33.560
So he did everything to protect me.

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:40.872
It’s my fault.

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.248
If I didn’t tell him that,

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.576
Thana wouldn’t have killed the witness.

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.768
He didn’t have to do it.

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.060
Chom.

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:01.152
Stop blaming yourself.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.720
You didn’t tell him to kill the witness.

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:09.104
If I didn’t manipulate him,

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.952
he wouldn’t have done those terrible things.

00:29:17.952 --> 00:29:19.950
This is my fault.

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:24.376
It’s my fault.

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:39.504
Is it possible
that this whole thing was Thana’s plan?

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:45.048
He might be Chatfah’s attacker.

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.360
I never thought we would get to this point.

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:14.392
The point where everything we see
will no longer be ours.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.480
None of them have been ours from the start.

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:20.728
The wealth,

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:22.120
the fame,

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:24.424
and this house.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.152
But for me,

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:33.008
what remains ours is that
we still have each other.

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:40.552
I’m very glad that I still have you guys.

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:45.032
Everything around me is just material things.

00:30:45.048 --> 00:30:47.030
I can get its replacement any time I want.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.808
But you guys,

00:30:50.784 --> 00:30:52.768
you are people I don’t want to lose.

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.088
Why did you tell me to come here?

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:17.968
I have something important

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.072
that I want us to find out together.

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.488
I think…

00:31:25.176 --> 00:31:27.180
the will that we saw,

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:31.180
it was written recently.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.792
Are you saying it’s fake?

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:38.040
It could be a real one.

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:40.800
But it was definitely written recently.

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:44.928
After…

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:47.960
Dad found out

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:50.680
that Chat wasn’t his child.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:55.920
Chat.

00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:01.184
She is Mom’s child with the man named Chad.

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:04.024
Her affair partner.

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.600
Are you sure it will be in this safe?

00:32:19.616 --> 00:32:21.600
Dad hadn’t used it for a long time.

00:32:21.632 --> 00:32:23.192
Because that’s what we thought.

00:32:23.216 --> 00:32:25.376
So we never opened it after Dad died.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.456
Do you know the combination to the safe?

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:29.968
I have an idea.

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:33.432
It’s really Pi’s birthday.

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:40.384
Why?

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.480
Why did he use my birthday?

00:32:44.144 --> 00:32:47.560
Because he loved you more than you think.

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:02.368
There’s nothing in here.

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:09.080
Is this his will?

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:11.136
No.

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:13.632
It’s his letter.

00:33:14.328 --> 00:33:16.330
His letter to the three of us.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.200
If any of you are reading this letter,

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.648
it means that my will has been opened.

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:36.656
(You three might have questions
about why you don’t get anything.)

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:40.520
(I don’t know when you find out the truth, )

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:44.088
(will you be mad or hate me even more?)

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:46.760
(But it’s okay.)

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.728
(I have my reasons why I did it.)

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:51.608
(I’ve braced myself for the consequences.)

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:55.816
(It’s included being hated or scolded by you.)

00:33:56.752 --> 00:33:58.184
(No matter what, )

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:02.144
(you shouldn’t be punished for what I did)

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:07.496
(The only inheritance I want to give you
is freedom.)

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:10.304
(I want you to live your life
free from those allegations.)

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:14.864
(I want you to live as an innocent
with no criminal records.)

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:18.088
(This is the last thing I can give you.)

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.160
(I’m sorry.)

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:23.512
He did that to protect us…

00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:26.640
from what he did?

00:34:39.128 --> 00:34:40.208
Come here and look at this.

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:51.176
The secret that Dad had kept.

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.992
Mom also didn’t want anyone to find out.

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:57.568
These are documents of
our company’s chemical and pesticide orders.

00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:59.800
They were not used on our farm.

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:04.432
But they were used to produce cheap drugs.

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:13.160
Our company was the center of illegal business.

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:17.344
If this is true,
then why did Dad give everything to Chatfah?

00:35:20.048 --> 00:35:21.528
Don’t tell me…

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.528
he did this to punish Mom?

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:30.952
Because Mom loved Chatfah the most.

00:35:31.976 --> 00:35:33.980
Chat knew everything, didn’t she?

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:46.520
Being rejected by your own family,

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:48.976
that is the most painful thing.

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:53.056
Do you think…

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:56.512
if we went to meet Chat like she told us,

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:03.072
what would happen?

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:07.296
We would find out everything that night.

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:15.810
Look here.

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:19.740
Aunt Fai,

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:23.240
she was Uncle Kajorn’s wife and Parn’s mom.

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:26.856
She knew our family’s secret.

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:34.112
We have a daughter.

00:36:34.128 --> 00:36:36.186
Have you ever thought about her
when you are doing this?

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:37.720
We started it. We can’t stop now.

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:39.976
We won’t be doing it for long.

00:36:40.008 --> 00:36:42.832
When we reach our goal, we will quit.

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:45.832
We have a powerful backer.

00:36:45.872 --> 00:36:47.580
Otherwise, we would have been busted
a long time ago.

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.184
What about other effects?

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.768
Do you know how many people died
because of the drug?

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:54.208
Have you ever cared about those people?

00:36:54.232 --> 00:36:56.504
Did I force them to buy it?

00:36:56.536 --> 00:36:57.552
They bought it of their own will.

00:36:57.568 --> 00:36:58.784
Kajorn!

00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:02.048
Everything that you have today
is bought with my money.

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.160
I don’t want it anymore.

00:37:03.184 --> 00:37:04.008
I want a divorce.

00:37:04.032 --> 00:37:05.792
I will run away with our daughter.

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.136
If she has to have a father like you,

00:37:08.176 --> 00:37:09.736
I would rather die.

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:11.580
Fai.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:24.340
Fai.

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:26.780
What do you want?

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:28.070
What do you mean?

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:30.280
You are making a scene.

00:37:30.304 --> 00:37:31.520
What do you want from it?

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:34.336
I want you guys to stop right now.

00:37:34.376 --> 00:37:37.648
I don’t want my kid to grow up
with a drug dealer dad.

00:37:37.664 --> 00:37:39.952
You are not only a drug dealer,
but also a producer.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:41.920
If you don’t tell anyone,

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:43.768
no one will know.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.576
How long do you think
you can run away from the truth?

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:49.928
I know you can do anything for money.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.816
But I never thought it would get this far.

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:54.270
Fai.

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:58.744
I will never let you leave this farm,

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.624
if you don’t tell me your conditions.

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:05.040
I don’t want your filthy money.

00:38:18.888 --> 00:38:19.888
Chat.

00:38:29.288 --> 00:38:30.272
Girls.

00:38:30.296 --> 00:38:31.584
Girls, sweetie.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.480
Oh my goodness.

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:39.080
Girls, hang on.

00:38:39.112 --> 00:38:40.592
I’ll come down to help you.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.240
Picha.

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:48.432
Chatfah.

00:38:48.448 --> 00:38:51.296
Asok, help the girls first.

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:53.992
Get a rope.

00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:58.090
Picha.

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:00.488
Chatfah.

00:39:00.512 --> 00:39:02.490
Fai, catch the rope.

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:05.360
Asok, help me pull them up.

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:23.080
Asok, call an ambulance.

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:32.780
Asok.

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:34.776
What are you doing?

00:39:35.176 --> 00:39:37.180
Kajorn, help me.

00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:39.180
Please help me.

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:46.288
If she is not dead, you and I are screwed.

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:48.184
But she is the mother of my child.

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:50.064
Do you want to go to jail?

00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:59.776
Help me, Kajorn.

00:39:59.808 --> 00:40:00.968
Kajorn.

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.160
I curse you.

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:17.504
You all will burn in hell.

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:31.976
(Those who are close to us, )

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:35.376
(They can hurt us the most
when they backstab us.)

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:42.720
THE DNA TEST CONFIRMS THAT
THE REMAINS BELONG TO
MRS. NONGPHAKA BUPPHACHINDA

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:50.872
SHE WAS THE MOTHER OF
MISS NIRAMOL BUPPHACHINDA.

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:01.960
(But they are also the easiest ones
we can push away)

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:14.920
(So when they betrayed us,
we need to pull ourselves together.)

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.256
Aunt Fai.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:25.048
The remains found in the well
belong to Aunt Fai.

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:29.336
She was killed by Dad and Uncle Kajorn.

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:35.208
Dad and Uncle Kajorn killed Parn’s mom?

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:50.336
I knew you would be the first one to come here.

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:00.720
Are you sure?

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:02.856
Am I the one you expected to see?

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:40.664
(We need to quickly find a way
to take revenge)

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:42.760
(before we miss our chance.)

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:48.216
Why do you look so surprised?

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:50.128
Sister.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:00.464
Miss Chompoonuch, you need to come with us
for a murder investigation.

00:43:00.496 --> 00:43:03.960
Being abandoned by our loved ones
is the most painful thing.

00:43:03.992 --> 00:43:05.392
You should continue to feel guilty.

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:08.800
We found signs of struggles.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.440
So we believe this is not a suicide.

00:43:11.464 --> 00:43:12.984
Where is Parn?

00:43:13.208 --> 00:43:16.904
What I am going to do to your family
is worse than that.
