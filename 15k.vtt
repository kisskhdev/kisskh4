WEBVTT

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:35.451


00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.360
[First time home in six years.]

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.720
[Welcome back.]

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.880
Yeah,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.520
your slippers.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.120
I'll take the purse.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.880
Thanks.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.160
No need for that.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.640
Place looks clean.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.720
Yeah?

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.360
I cleaned all day

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.560
for you.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.440
C'mon,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.960
rest up.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.600
I'll fix us something to eat.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.440
Something light,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.320
how about noodles?

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.920
We could go out.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.200
You gotta be hungry.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.880
I'll make you

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.560
quick noodles.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.360
Sure.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.840
I'll start now.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.320
Checking my phone?

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.920
Just...

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.840
checking time.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.680
You need reading glasses?

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.400
Huh?

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.399
Need reading glasses now?

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.040
What?

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.839
Whose are these?

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.880
Glasses? No idea.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.320
These are reading glasses.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.400
Where did these...

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.080
yours?

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.320
Mine?

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.920
Can't see through them.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.720
No way

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.680
they're mine.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.640
It's fishy.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.680
[I've no idea...]

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.320
Don't need

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.440
to turn.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.680
Stop here.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.640
OK.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.280
Continue?

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.880
Yes.

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.680
OK.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.480
Who's "Sunny Butterfly?"

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.600
She's just

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.920
someone from

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.880
my photo club.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.600
We take photos together.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.320
Oh, she feels

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.560
"so bad"

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.880
about losing your jacket.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.400
It's not what you think.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.160
I just lent her

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.440
my UV jacket.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.600
She lost it and

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.840
offered to replace it.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.400
Why were you

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.840
lending her anything?

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.160
It was burning!

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.440
Not your problem,

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.720
is it?

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.920
She ain't got one.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.280
Since when is that

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.760
your concern?

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.520
Just a jacket,

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.480
why make a fuss?

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.080
Just a jacket?

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.800
Texting about

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.280
a "jacket" at 9 PM?

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.080
Yeah, right!

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.800
Who buys

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.240
that excuse?

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.480
Maybe she's

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.640
tied up during the day.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.640
That was her free time

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.159
or...

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:50.200
You seem to know

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.440
her schedule well, huh?

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.040
What's the deal?

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.000
Just a jacket.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.720
Why are you making such a fuss?

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.960
How'd you like it

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.400
if I did something like this?

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.200
You're checking my phone,

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.320
how should I feel?

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.360
Fine. Won't check anymore.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.560
I won't care at all.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.240
ALRIGHT?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.240
About the job hunt.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.080
Just

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.200
take your time.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.720
But maybe...

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.040
you shouldn't crash at their place

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:50.720
forever.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.720
Why not rent your own place?

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.440
Can't afford it.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:55.800
C'mon,

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.480
Daddy's got your back!

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Might make it

00:07:59.280 --> 00:07:59.960
easier to

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.480
break the news to

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.080
your mom.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.120
How?

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.360
[You know Mom.]

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.360
[Well...]

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.200
Xinying?

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.400
You're not in Canada?

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.480
[Well...um...]

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.720
What's happened?

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.400
She's at Li Manfei's

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.520
and you knew it?

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:33.720
Kinda.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.320
Don't "kinda" me!

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:36.840
Did you know

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.039
or not?

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.039
Simple question!

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.120
I knew it.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.480
Lu Xinying!

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.680
Six years in Canada! I did

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.680
everything,

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.480
your laundry, cooking,

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.480
driving, everything!

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.200
Now everyone's in

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.960
on the secret

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.160
except me!

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.480
Do you think it fair?

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.960
That's not...

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.240
Hands off!

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.560
This is exactly why I didn't

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.280
tell you...

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.240
What?

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.880
Look me in the eye.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.080
Do you feel comfortable with that?

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.000
Stop signaling!

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:11.880
Over here,

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.200
where I can see you, now!

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.200
Some father

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.520
you are,

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.360
encouraging this.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.480
Your phone, now!

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.320
Book tomorrow's

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.720
earliest flight.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:26.640
She's leaving for Canada!

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.720
You can't mean that.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.440
Mom,

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.840
be reasonable!

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.000
I am!

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:32.960
I'm being respectful!

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.200
I'd be justified

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.840
in slapping you

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.160
right now!

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.040
Easy now, easy.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.120
Y'know?

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.000
Did I hit you?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Quit the drama!

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:41.840
Don't push me!

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.160
Young lady!

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.040
Push you?

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:43.640
How?

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.600
This is your fault!

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.280
Let me handle...

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.000
Stop the act!

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:46.640
I'll handle her.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.840
Go reflect!

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:48.560
Too late

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.040
to parent now!

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.240
Fine! I'll leave!

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.760
Three minutes to pack

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.080
and get down here!

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:54.760
Young lady!

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.640
Take three days

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.520
to reflect!

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.840
Minutes, not days!

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.440
Oh, didn't catch that.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.960
Always straddling the fence.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.800
Playing Mr. Nice Guy,

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.520
you're the worst!

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.480
Let's calm down.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.720
Liar!

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.040
Teaching her to lie to me!

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.240
C'mon, please...

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.440
And Li Manfei's mother,

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.240
what a phony,

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.240
putting on a show!

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.480
Let's talk in the car.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.200
You'll be my death.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.000
[Yeah,]

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.720
[Xinying's]

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.160
[no longer with us.]

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:20.400
Could she

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.000
get the job back,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.200
if she

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.600
returns?

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.800
Any...

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.360
any openings?

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.320
[We're]

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.080
[fully staffed.]

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.240
[Not hiring.]

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.240
[Sorry.]

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.680
Thanks.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.960
She told you everything already.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.520
Why embarrass her

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.080
by calling her coworkers?

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.120
Quiet!

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.640
[Hello?]

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.080
Lily?

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.080
[Oh, yes?]

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.240
Can you hear me?

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.400
It's Zhou Ailing.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.520
[Oh...right...]

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.720
I wanna

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.000
inquire about

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.400
the Canadian real estate

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.200
market.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.560
You helped us buy

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.440
that apartment.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.200
Since I'm not there,

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.920
what's the market like?

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.200
[It's so-so.]

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.080
[Tough to sell now.]

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.440
[By the way,]

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.360
[your daughter]

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.320
[switched realtors.]

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.720
[Actually I saw]

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.840
[your apartment]

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.920
[listed online,]

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.960
[for rent.]

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.880
[Got tenants pretty fast.]

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.080
It's rented?

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.600
[Yeah, yeah.]

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.240
Oh,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.640
I see.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.840
[Are you thinking of selling]

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.000
[instead of renting?]

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.400
[Leave for good?]

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.080
No, just...

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.320
let me think it over.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.280
I'll call

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.840
if I need anything.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.480
[Sure thing.]

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.720
Thanks for your time.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.400
[No problem. Bye.]

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.480
Heard that?

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.320
Yes.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.240
Rented out.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.120
That brat!

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.720
Don't get

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.720
too worked up.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.520
Cool down first.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.040
Stop talking!

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.160
- I'm back, Mom.
- Hi!

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.240
Had fun?

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.040
Whatever.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.120
Honey,

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.520
made you birthday noodles.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.160
- Not hungry.
- One bite...

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.880
About Xinying...

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.520
I couldn't

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.520
figure out

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.480
how to tell you.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.320
Waited for

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.520
the right time,

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.520
but...

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.240
Also,

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.120
there's more...

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:46.880
Don't jump to conclusions!

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.880
You know,

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.000
that startup story?

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:50.800
A lie.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.080
I got laid off.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.600
You lost your job?

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.000
No need to repeat it.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.600
At my age,

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.840
finding a decent job

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:06.800
isn't easy.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.120
Been driving

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.120
ride-share.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.640
That's why

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.440
the front seat's a bit off,

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.600
the one you kept talking.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.360
Why hide this

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.440
so long?

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.840
Why spread

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.280
the worry around?

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.600
Also, how?

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.240
Your husband,

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.520
top university grad,

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.360
pioneer foreign company exec,

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.520
got booted out?

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.800
It's OK.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.080
Love driving anyway.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.960
Feel good about this gig.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.840
You didn't have to

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.400
do ride-share.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.960
Your back can't take it.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.360
Had no choice.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.680
Bills to pay,

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.840
money for Xinying,

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.880
luxury brands for someone

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:55.720
to show off.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:56.680
I've shouldered it

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:57.760
all alone.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.760
What does that mean,

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:01.840
huh?

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:02.200
That last bit...

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.920
I'm freeloading?

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:04.920
The last bit

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:05.840
was a joke.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.120
Some joke!

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.720
So,

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.080
who pushed for

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.520
overseas education?

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.360
Me.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.560
Who made me quit my job?

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.320
Still me...

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.520
Right? Your calls,

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.560
we followed.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.280
Yeah, yeah, I...

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.720
Getting all snarky now,

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.720
like I'm some freeloader.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.720
No, no, you're

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.720
reading too much into it.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.200
I was genuinely joking.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.200
Oh, yeah?

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.360
Six years abroad,

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.080
you never visited once.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.320
Heartless!

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.040
Was swamped with work.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:36.880
Then had to

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:37.880
drive for money.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.080
Enough with your

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.280
"busy" excuse.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.120
Who knows what's true?

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.640
Those tickets cost so much...

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:45.120
I...

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:46.280
had...

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.200
Yeah?

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.120
Hi there!

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.680
Oh, you're both in!

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:58.120
Yes, yes.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:58.800
Heard

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.080
voices,

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.480
thought you'd

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.600
returned.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.280
Have a seat.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.839
Please, sit. What's up?

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:05.400
Please.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.920
Well,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:08.720
here's the thing.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:09.720
Xiaofeng's

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.880
getting married.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:12.960
Yeah.

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:14.079
So soon!

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:14.680
Congratulations!

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.560
He's of age.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:16.720
Need a place

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.920
for marriage.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:18.960
Thought

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.200
this place

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.359
would work,

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:22.520
perfect for

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:23.640
keeping close.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.000
Just downstairs.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:25.520
Yeah.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.640
So we'll

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.200
need the house back.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.640
- Got it.
- But...

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.520
Happy for the wedding,

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.760
but,

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:34.400
remember

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.280
our agreement?

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.920
We sold the place

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.960
at a fair price.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:39.360
True, true.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.760
You promised

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.840
long-term

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:42.920
rental.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:43.840
Indeed,

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.120
really sorry.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.080
You sold

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.440
two houses for

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.640
Xinying's education,

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.240
and when I bought this place,

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.360
I promised

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.480
you could

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.040
stay.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.440
It was your home after all.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:55.520
But now...

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.240
my son's gotta get married...

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:58.640
We get it.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.040
Big moment.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.640
Right, right.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.480
Never even raised the rent

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.160
all this time.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:05.840
True, true.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.120
Tell you what,

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.720
last three months

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.000
rent-free!

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.680
- But...
- Move out in three months?

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:15.120
Yes.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:15.880
OK,

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.840
we'll find a place

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:18.520
and move.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:19.560
Perfect!

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.960
That's settled!

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:21.840
Really,

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.880
no rent for three months,

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:23.640
I mean it!

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.640
Thanks, thanks.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.400
It's late. I'm off.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.200
Good night!

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:27.800
Good night!

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:28.760
[OK, bye!]

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:29.600
[No need to see me off.]

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.520
[Congrats again!]

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.360
Thanks.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.280
Xiaofeng's getting married...

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:38.600
So...

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.960
Dumbass!

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.040
Complete idiot!

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.240
Just kill me now!

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.880
It's their property.

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.000
They've

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:50.560
got right

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.800
to have it back!

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.120
Mrs. Zhou,

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.400
thanks for coming.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:17.600
We've got

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.640
a big crowd today.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:19.800
Only you could handle

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.920
this many people.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.160
Not really,

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:23.880
just a bit

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.960
more experienced.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.280
Nah,

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.400
too humble.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.720
Everyone says

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.600
you and your daughter are their inspiration.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.240
This way.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.120
Mrs. Zhou,

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.880
feeling OK?

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:48.880
Oh yeah,

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:51.680
where's my seat?

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.080
There, follow me.

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:54.520
Please.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.520
Mrs. Zhou, up there...

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.000
Mrs. Zhou, stage seating.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.280
Now?

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:13.920
Yeah, everyone's waiting.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:14.440
C'mon.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.480
Mom, hear this,

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.080
Xinying's mom showed up!

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.400
I'm here with my students

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.640
performing.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.560
[Now,]

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.320
[our regular speaker,]

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.040
[Mrs. Zhou,]

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:28.360
[sharing]

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.240
[her experience!]

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.440
Let me take that purse.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.680
Thanks.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.320
[Please sit here.]

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.160
[Round of applause!]

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.120
Hello,

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.480
I'm...

00:20:58.880 --> 00:20:59.520
Give me this.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.640
Will get you a new one.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.120
All good!

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.160
Hello,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.080
I am...

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.240
She's giving a speech...

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.120
I'm...

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.240
Lu Xinying's mother...

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.520
Name is...

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.840
No medicine box in trash.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:57.960
You skipped

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:58.920
insulin again?

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:00.920
Not needed every day.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.280
Since when are you the doctor?

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:04.760
It's out!

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:05.680
I don't buy it!

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:06.960
Look yourself.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.040
Gone for days.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:08.920
Tell me the name.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:09.680
I'll get some.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:11.920
Not covered by insurance.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.680
No money!

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:14.880
Where's

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.120
Dad's IOU

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:16.800
you mentioned?

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.600
His stuff,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.240
not mine.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.360
How should I know?

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.680
Tell him to find it.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.320
Stop messing around.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.280
I'm trying

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.280
to help.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:35.600
He...

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.960
used to clean

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.400
pigeon poop

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.400
on the roof.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.480
Check fertilizer container?

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.920
Having fun?

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.640
What's the point of tricking you!

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:52.960
Hello.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:53.680
Hello.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.640
Mr. Ge?

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.280
Yes.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.680
I'm Mr. Chen's secretary.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.320
He wants to

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.520
check your IOU

00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.960
with accounting.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:00.720
We'll transfer

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.560
your money

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.120
after verification.

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:02.680
OK,

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.720
here it is.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:04.760
Tell accounting,

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.520
no late fees needed,

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.560
just return

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.480
the money quickly.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.120
Please

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.200
wait here a bit.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:11.560
OK.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:11.920
OK.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:12.640
Thanks.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.320
Hi.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:27.520
Hello, sir.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.520
Can you call and

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:29.160
ask about

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.240
my money?

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.240
What's going on?

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.200
One moment.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:37.640
Got it.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.520
Sir,

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.400
no unscheduled

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.760
visits today.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.200
Please come another day.

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.760
Not visiting,

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.080
someone just took my IOU.

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:48.440
Sorry,

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.880
this is what

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.040
I was informed.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.400
They're have a meeting.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.040
What?

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.000
I waited four hours!

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.040
Why didn't you say so?

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.200
Sorry, sir.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.040
Skip the sorry.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:57.880
Just return

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:58.560
my IOU,

00:23:58.560 --> 00:23:59.720
I'll come another time.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.960
I don't know about any IOU.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.400
Really sorry, sir.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.000
What're you talking about!

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.440
What do you mean you don't know?

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.560
She changed shifts. It's not...

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.160
Changed shifts?

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:08.800
Someone

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:09.600
just took the IOU from me.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.720
We'll call the police if this goes on.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:11.240
Sir.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.800
Dad, I'm not lying.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.640
The interview went really well today.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.880
I just felt the company

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.040
didn't meet

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:19.960
my employment standards.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.280
So I want to keep looking.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:25.160
Really.

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.720
Don't worry about me.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:28.800
Focus on driving.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.600
Be careful.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.400
Alright. I'm hanging up.

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:39.400
No rush.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.400
Right now,

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.560
you don't have solid evidence.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:42.640
The security footage is broken.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:43.640
And they all claim

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.440
they didn't take anything.

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:45.520
In this situation,

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.840
we can't open a case.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.480
They're just taking advantage.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:49.920
That money is really important to me.

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.320
It's for my grandma's medical treatment.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:52.240
We

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.640
won't let this go.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.720
But we need to investigate first.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.640
We'll let you know.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.040
I just learned

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.520
what it means to be helplessly cheated.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.120
Is this the so-called

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:15.960
change in social class

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.440
making everything different?

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.000
We can't just take this lying down.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.280
I have experience with debt collection.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.120
Look, Kuang Dazhi is so sly,

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.600
but I got the money back from him.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.120
I'll help you get your money back.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.240
I'm sorry about the Kuang Dazhi thing.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:33.960
It's in the past.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.640
You'd still dare to help me?

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:37.840
Of course.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.560
You haven't even fixed your own job.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.400
Can you not

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.520
poke at my sore spot?

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.600
You just said it yourself.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:50.920
I think helping you get the money back

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:51.680
is way more fulfilling

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.880
than finding a job.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:56.880
We've got nothing to lose.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.120
Let's go find him at his factory.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.400
Don't work here anymore.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.360
Spread the word.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.280
Here, take it.

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.200
Young lady,

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:08.640
last time was a misunderstanding.

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:09.640
Let's talk this through.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.640
[This container of cotton]

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.560
[is all I have left now.]

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.560
[I really can't give you anything else.]

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.040
Ge Kaiyang, have you thought about it?

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.640
That shady boss

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.840
just said

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.080
it's now or never.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:38.480
This is

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.440
our only chance today.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.840
If we don't settle this today,

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:41.760
we might

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:42.800
never see him again,

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.640
never find him,

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:44.920
and never get the money back.

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.280
Ge Kaiyang, say something.

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.000
Are you crying?

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.440
Just one word.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.120
Money or pride?

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:57.600
Money.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.040
Until we find

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.640
a suitable buyer,

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:03.400
this container of cotton

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.000
will stay in your warehouse.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.600
You're responsible for the storage fee.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:07.920
Hear me out.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.360
Three-month deadline.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:11.480
After three months,

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.280
either we come

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.160
take the cotton,

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.000
or it's

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.080
all yours.

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.040
We won't ask for a cent. Deal?

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:18.880
Your cotton here

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:19.920
is all raw material.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.200
We have to sell it to a factory.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.640
That's hard to sell.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.000
If you won't even

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.200
cover the storage fee,

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.880
just pay up.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.520
Tomorrow I'll get more media

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.280
to protest at your company entrance.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:32.440
Let's go.

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.360
Wait, wait.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.240
I really have no money right now.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:37.720
This raw material

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:38.960
was given to me as payment.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.360
How about this?

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.960
You take this container of goods.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.040
I'll cover three months' storage fee.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.600
I'll go with what she says.

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.160
Alright?

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:50.400
Okay.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.080
So it's agreed.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.520
I'll go print the agreement.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:58.800
Do you think

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.400
we can sell

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.440
all this cotton

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.760
in three months?

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.000
Have you forgotten what I did

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:04.960
in Canada?

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.200
Sell it to the bank?

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.640
Ge Kaiyang, no wonder it took you

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.880
seven years for your bachelor's. You...

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:14.960
Thank you.

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.040
No... No problem.

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:36.840
Who are you looking for?

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:37.720
Hello.

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:40.960
We're raw material suppliers.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.160
We're here to discuss business.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:43.560
Not interested.

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.760
Get out of here.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.200
Stop hanging around. Get out now.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.640
I'll call security if you don't leave.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:52.320
I'm sorry.

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.200
Sir.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.400
Hello.

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:55.560
Are you out of your mind?

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:56.440
Sorry, we have

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.560
1.5 tons of cotton.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.480
Raw material. Very high quality.

00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:58.800
Not interested.

00:28:58.800 --> 00:28:59.640
Would you like to see?

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.600
We... We have inspection reports.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.200
Take a look.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.360
Sir, please have a look.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.560
It's legitimate!

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:04.920
Ge Kaiyang, stop chasing him!

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.920
Don't stress about it too much.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:10.600
I never

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.000
really expected to get that money back.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.960
No. I promised

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.080
I'd help you get it.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.400
I have a bachelor's in economics.

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.600
And I can't even sell

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.720
one box of cotton.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.520
Do you think I'm a total disgrace?

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:31.280
Not at all.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.000
Look, this job posting

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
seems like a good fit for you.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:53.840
Overseas returnees preferred.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.120
I submitted my resume.

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.360
Never heard back.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.440
It's not like

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.640
I can't find a job.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.600
I just haven't found the right fit.

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.360
Mom, your delivery.

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.840
I didn't order anything.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.200
I didn't either.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:26.560
Coming.

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.640
Hello, are you Manfei?

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.160
I'm... I'm Xinying's dad.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.000
Well, is Xinying here?

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.480
Freshwater Giant Prawn.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.160
Stir-Fried Double Crispy Delights.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.080
And I added

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:47.840
a Seafood Steamed Egg for you.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.640
Dad, I'm allergic to eggs.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.920
I don't know how it happened.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.280
When I was in Canada,

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.680
I ate something once

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.480
and broke out in a rash all over.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.000
Got tested at the hospital.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.720
Said I'm allergic to eggs.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.040
When did it happen?

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:11.080
Second year of high school in Canada.

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.760
My body

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.120
wanted to fit in more than I do.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.960
Because foreigners

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.400
often have allergies

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.600
to eggs or milk.

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.360
Alright. I'll change it.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:23.880
Okay.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.000
Dad, you didn't drive today?

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.360
I'm off today.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.800
Alright. Let me.

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:46.560
Here.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:51.400
That's enough.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.480
You drink too?

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.960
I'm 26.

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.080
Come on.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:03.480
Come on.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.760
After you went back with Mom last time,

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.080
did you two continue...

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.320
Did you drink like this in Canada too?

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.240
The legal drinking age in Canada is 19.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.440
I could buy

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:28.520
my own alcohol

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.000
back in 2017.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.800
Dad, I'm asking you.

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.720
What did Mom say after you went back?

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:38.920
We had a nice chat.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:40.560
Didn't fight.

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.640
She just told me to sleep on the couch.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.440
Still hasn't spoken to me.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.400
Last time at the convenience store,

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.960
you just drank the soup from the oden.

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:00.280
Here I am treating you to a meal,

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.560
and you're allergic to the dish.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:03.480
What kind of father am I.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.000
It's fine.

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.560
Do you remember

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:10.560
the last time

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.560
we had a proper meal together?

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.440
Last time?

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.360
Before I went abroad?

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.040
At...

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:18.960
that...

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:19.840
Lucheng Kitchen

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.520
And Aunt and Uncle were there too.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.360
We didn't get a private room that day.

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.640
Mom scolded us for it.

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:25.880
No, I mean

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.360
just the two of us, alone.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:30.320
Alone.

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.480
Back when you were in elementary school.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.320
I had just been promoted to manager.

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.120
Probably 2007.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.320
On Teacher's Day,

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.440
your mom had an event at school.

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:38.960
She told me

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:39.960
to pick you up from piano lessons

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.040
and take you to eat.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.440
Remember?

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.520
And you said you wanted spicy hot pot.

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.440
I said no way.

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.720
Your mom definitely wouldn't allow it.

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:48.520
We argued

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:49.800
and you ended up crying.

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:52.560
But later,

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:53.440
we still went to eat spicy hot pot.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:54.160
Right.

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:54.880
Yeah? When we got home,

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:55.680
you kept telling me

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.480
not to let Mom find out.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.040
We brushed our teeth like crazy,

00:33:59.040 --> 00:33:59.720
over and over.

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.320
I even washed our clothes.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.480
Afraid she'd smell it.

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:12.360
When Mom got back, she asked me

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:13.679
why you were

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:15.040
acting so nice

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.679
and whether he felt guilty for something.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:17.639
She asked me

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:19.239
where we ate

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:20.239
and if we met

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:21.320
any pretty women.

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.400
Your mom is just like that.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:25.920
She

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:27.679
overthinks.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:28.960
Always suspicious of everything.

00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:38.120
Dad, you ordered so much.

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:39.000
We won't finish it.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.239
We'll take our time.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.239
Alright.

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:46.679
Let me get that. Thanks.

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:47.360
Thank you.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.040
Here.

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:50.480
Okay. Eat something.

00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:51.239
Here.

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:54.560
I'm happy to eat with you.

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:55.960
And

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.680
you can even have a drink with me.

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:06.720
But we can't

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.280
let your mom stay home unhappy

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.480
by herself, right?

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.960
What if she gets sick after a while?

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.920
So I think

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.200
we need to figure out a way

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.200
to calm her down.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.240
Mom's always been like that.

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.640
If things don't go her way,

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.760
she's unhappy.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.760
The only way

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.880
to make her happy right now

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.680
is for me to get back to Canada.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:32.120
No, no.

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.400
That's not what I meant. I...

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.640
She's just worried about you.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:37.880
You snuck back here

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.280
all by yourself

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:40.960
and are staying at a friend's place.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.560
And now you don't have a job.

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:44.560
Of course, I know

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:45.560
you're trying to find one.

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:46.800
Dad, I really don't think

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.000
this is about the job.

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:48.800
Right.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.720
But we need to put your mom's mind

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:51.640
at ease.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.360
I think you could

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.800
give in a bit and apologize to her.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:57.880
Just because I won't go back to Canada?

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.120
Shouldn't it

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.920
be my own decision, Dad?

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.360
Yes.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.320
I understand your point of view.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.640
But look,

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:12.960
when you went to study,

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.760
your mom quit her job

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.680
to be with you there for six years.

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:19.320
That means she basically

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.200
had no personal life

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:20.920
of her own.

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:23.280
She really gave up

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.000
a lot for you.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.160
So you have to understand her.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.600
But I never asked for it.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:32.160
The decision for me to study in Canada

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.560
was made by you.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.080
You never discussed it with me.

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.560
Just like learning piano.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.880
You arranged everything

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:39.120
and then told me

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:39.960
to take lessons.

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:40.960
No.

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.280
You know all this.

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.720
Besides, you have a talent

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:45.320
for piano.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.240
Even the teacher said so.

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:47.680
You passed level ten.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.280
But I don't like it, Dad.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.720
But you...

00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:59.120
never said anything before.

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:00.920
What was I supposed to say?

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.120
Mom kept saying

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.640
how many months

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.560
of your salaries

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:07.960
the piano cost,

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.120
how much

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.480
the tutor cost,

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.680
and how we could've

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:12.760
gone on vacation

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:13.640
like Mr. Qian's family

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.400
if we'd saved that money.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.400
How could I told Mom

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.840
I didn't like learning piano?

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:20.800
We were afraid

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.080
you wouldn't appreciate

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.760
the learning opportunity, so...

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.560
I complained to her before.

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.360
She said

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:30.960
I never

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.600
stuck to anything.

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.040
She said only by sticking

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.440
with a hobby

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:37.760
could you get good at it.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.360
But piano

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.800
was never my hobby.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.120
I get it.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:50.320
Your mom can be

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.320
a bit stubborn sometimes.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:53.640
But

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:56.960
you really hurt her

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.080
this time.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.120
She was so happy

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.360
when she found out you were working

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.360
at a bank in Canada.

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.400
She told everyone

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.040
you were her pride.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.480
She even lectured everyone about it.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.400
But with you coming back like this,

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.040
it's like

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.400
her six years were wasted.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.600
She has nothing to show for it.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:38.800
Dad, actually,

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.800
I tried to please her.

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.480
I really tried hard to please her. I...

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.920
I wanted to stay in Canada.

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:53.160
I'm not lying.

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:57.080
When I first went to Canada,

00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:59.400
Mom told me

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:01.360
not to hang out

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.840
with the Chinese kids,

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.360
or my spoken English wouldn't improve.

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:07.560
I said okay.

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:10.800
So I hung out

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.360
with the foreign kids.

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.000
Then she said

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.840
because I was hanging out with them,

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:17.880
I wore makeup

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:18.840
and dressed

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:19.600
inappropriately.

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.080
She thought I dressed too revealingly.

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:22.680
Then they took me to see

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:23.520
an avant-garde art exhibit.

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:24.920
Then she got mad again.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.280
She said that wasn't something

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.920
for someone my age to see.

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:29.800
So,

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.960
she wanted me to fit in,

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:33.120
but then she was like this.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.680
Those foreign kids

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:35.720
are all like that.

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:38.400
I... I think

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:39.640
she wants everything on me.

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.080
She wants me to be like that,

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:41.880
but also wants me

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.760
to live a conventional life

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.840
like Chinese kids.

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:47.560
Dad, I can't

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:49.400
do anything right.

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.520
Whether I try to fit in or not,

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:52.880
it's never right.

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:03.800
Hello.

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.040
Get me another bottle of wine.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:15.600
There, there.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.280
Eat up.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:18.840
Try this.

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.200
Have some shrimp.

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.080
Alright, no more talking. Let's eat.

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:29.200
Don't cry. Why are you crying?

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:29.720
I'm not.

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:30.640
I'm not.

00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:37.120
I don't want to quit my job.

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:39.520
I'm an excellent teacher.

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:40.640
I have a decent job.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.200
Why should I quit?

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.880
Besides, I've asked a lot of people.

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.360
Even the principal said so.

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:47.920
He said kids nowadays

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.880
can just get their bachelor's degree

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:50.800
at home,

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.240
and then go abroad for a master's

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.880
or PhD later. There's still time.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.040
I understand.

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.480
That is a common view.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.120
But I believe

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:00.680
the earlier she goes,

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:01.920
the better she can

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.560
settle into life there.

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.160
Think about it.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.440
If she goes

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.760
after her bachelor's or master's,

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:09.840
her spoken English won't be

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.320
as good as if she'd grown up there.

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.520
By then, it's hard

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:13.360
to change.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.720
Also, if she doesn't

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.160
grow up with local kids,

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:19.680
how will she have anything in common

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:20.720
with them later?

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:22.280
How is she supposed to

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:23.520
really fit into the local life

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:24.760
and culture then?

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.840
Most of all, I have another concern.

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.440
Competition in China

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.160
is so fierce these days.

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.000
What if

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.800
Xinying doesn't perform well

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:36.720
and fails the college entrance exam?

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.440
Why think about

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:39.720
that "what if"?

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.400
I'm just a bit worried.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:42.800
What if she doesn't do well

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.040
and it affects her mindset?

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:45.160
Going abroad then

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.040
might be even more difficult.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.080
Right?

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:52.240
You know

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.480
Mr. Li Bo at our company?

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.200
His son

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.120
and Zhou Hong's daughter

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:00.960
were sent abroad early.

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:02.440
Sending Xinying now

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:03.280
is already considered late.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.120
They were sent out already?

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:06.040
And Mr. Li's wife

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:06.880
is there with their son.

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:08.600
She quit her job?

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.360
She worked at a foreign company.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:11.800
Quit just like that.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:14.560
All for the kids.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.440
Me going over alone?

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:24.880
A woman by myself?

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.000
My English isn't good.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.680
I'd be in an unfamiliar place all alone.

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.360
I'm scared.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.040
I completely understand that.

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:35.600
Anyone would feel

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:36.960
out of place

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:38.600
in a new environment.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.240
And your teaching job

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:42.360
is really good and stable.

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.560
But we're doing this

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.440
so that our daughter

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.880
can have a better future.

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:49.840
Right?

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.160
I promise

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.080
I will support

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:55.800
this family.

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:01.120
Dad.

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:02.960
Are you okay?

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:06.080
I slipped again.

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:08.680
You scared me.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.560
You barely drank

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.000
that second bottle, did you?

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:16.880
Of course I drank it.

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:19.000
You had one glass from the second bottle.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.480
I drank the rest.

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.280
You've grown up.

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:25.920
And your tolerance has improved.

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.520
You're better than me now.

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:38.960
Do you know

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.880
why I decided to send you

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.320
to study in Canada?

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.240
Because...

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:49.680
Because my cousin went there.

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.280
And my high school scores weren't good.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:56.920
Listen,

00:43:58.320 --> 00:43:59.280
this decision

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:00.680
was very hard

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:01.960
for both

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.200
you and me.

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:04.400
So difficult.

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:07.440
It meant

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:09.840
we'd have to live apart.

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:11.480
There was

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:12.680
financial pressure.

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.040
But when your mom was pregnant with you,

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:17.000
she often patted her belly and said,

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:20.320
"Just don't be a wimp like your dad."

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:23.520
I immediately said

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.640
that's impossible.

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:28.280
Your mom and I came to an agreement.

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.040
We decided that once you grown up,

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:31.800
you could leave

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:32.840
this little town

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:35.600
and see

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:37.760
the bigger world

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:40.120
we've never seen.

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:47.200
Dad.

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.800
So annoying.

00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:58.760
Dad, I caught you!

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:00.440
You caught me.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:02.600
Well...

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.200
I can't even remember

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:07.120
how long it's been

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.240
since last time I hugged you.
