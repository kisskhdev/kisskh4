THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL,

SETTINGS AND EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
SERIES HAVE BEEN FICTIONALLY CREATED

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:47.756
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

WITH THE CONSENT OF
AND IN THE PRESENCE OF GUARDIANS

00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:01.186
Finish that rat, Kang Taehoon,

00:01:04.106 --> 00:01:05.357
quietly by yourself.

00:01:20.706 --> 00:01:22.332
Don't take too long.

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:24.793
Make up your mind...

00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:28.130
by tomorrow.

- Her name's Kang Miyoung?

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:30.150
Yes, that's correct.

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:31.777
She's getting great responses.

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:34.696

there's something touching about her--

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.256
Miyoung.

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.216
Good job. Well done.

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.844
You've got time, right?
Sing some more today.

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:40.804
I thought the last stage was over.

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:44.015
Somewhere else, not here.

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:46.476
- Somewhere else?
Hmm.

00:03:48.437 --> 00:03:51.815
Come on and sing just a few songs inside.

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:52.899
I don't want to.

00:03:52.983 --> 00:03:55.735
It's not even a stage.
I have no reason to do it.

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.196
You're frustrating.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.200
Chairman Kang Taehoon
is the older cousin of the owner here.

00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:04.578
He made an investment too.

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:06.413
He's practically the owner.

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:07.789
Goodness gracious.

00:04:08.707 --> 00:04:12.127
Stop being stubborn,
or you won't get to sing here again.

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:16.006
Don't miss this opportunity,
just go inside.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:19.092
It'll be just one song, okay?

00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:20.343
Do this for me, please.

00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:28.477
Wow. Just wow.

00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:30.645
Welcome.

00:04:31.188 --> 00:04:33.231
It's nice to meet you. I'm Kang Taehoon.

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:35.692
Say hello.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:37.277
Yes.

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:38.820
Hello.

00:04:40.322 --> 00:04:41.323
It must be awkward.

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:43.617
I asked to escort you over,
knowing it'd be rude.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.536
I was so impressed by your performances.

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:48.163
Have a seat.

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:50.373
I feel more comfortable here.

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:52.959
I'm not a bad person.

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:54.419
I'm a fan of yours.

00:04:54.503 --> 00:04:55.754
And a subscriber.

00:04:56.797 --> 00:04:58.256
Little Singing Room, right?

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:01.927
I liked your videos, wrote comments,
and turned on notifications too.

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:05.680
Have a seat.

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:07.307
Sit down. Sit.

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:26.993
Do you perhaps know...

00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:30.080
the House of Medici in Italy?

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.458
They're a filthy rich family.

00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:36.711
They invested a lot in artists, you know.

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:37.879
Like Michelangelo.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:40.006
And...

00:05:40.966 --> 00:05:43.134
some other famous artists we know...

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:46.304
Michelangelo. Anyway.

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:48.515
They invested so much in such people.

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:51.893
That was how that period came to be.
You know, the golden age.

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:54.062
The Re...

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:56.022
Re...

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:00.485
- Renaissance.
- Renaissance.

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:03.697
You see, people say that
you have to be poor to be a good artist,

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:04.781
but I disagree.

00:06:04.865 --> 00:06:07.450
"Art wouldn't exist without money."

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:08.869
Based on that idea,

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:11.788
I made this place, Nilbana.

00:06:11.872 --> 00:06:16.418
But it wasn't as ideal because
the singers were below expectations.

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:17.752
But then,

00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:21.214
your singing voice made me stop

00:06:22.424 --> 00:06:23.758
to listen and watch.

00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:26.344
"Who is that woman?"

00:06:27.596 --> 00:06:31.182
There's something touching
about your voice.

00:06:32.893 --> 00:06:35.478
As a fan and a subscriber of yours,

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:38.690
I'd like to hear you sing
from start to finish.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.191
Is that okay?

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:45.906
Please do this for me.

- Will she be okay?
- What do you mean?

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:55.100
I'm talking about Miyoung.

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:57.185
The gangster who visited you
the other day.

00:07:57.268 --> 00:07:58.603
Isn't he her boyfriend?

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:01.523
It seemed so.

00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:06.569
She's just going to sing, nothing else.

00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:10.949
Why did you have to say something useless
and get me worried?

It moved my heart.

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:06.504
Come sit here. Let's talk about music.

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:08.840
Do you drink?

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:11.301
Let's casually have one glass.

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:13.553
I'm sorry. I'm meeting someone today.

00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:20.226
You keep treating me like I'm a lowlife.

00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:26.149
Fine. I'll be lowly, then.

This guy will be holding your bag.

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:37.869
Have just one glass.

00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:40.330
- I won't keep you all night.
- Give it to me.

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:44.209
I need to go meet my boyfriend.

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:46.252
Your boyfriend?

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:49.923
I wonder what he does for a living.

00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:58.848
I have no reason to tell you about him.

00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:02.685
He won't be happy
if he finds out that I'm here.

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:04.979
Why won't he be happy?

00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:07.482
This is just a casual get-together.

00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:10.401
Don't get me wrong.

00:10:10.485 --> 00:10:13.488
I wouldn't force a woman
into doing something.

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:18.660
Cheonho.

00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:46.354
- Yes.
- Miyoung's boyfriend is here.

00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:50.650
Don't tell him she's here.

00:10:50.733 --> 00:10:52.652
Sir, go elsewhere or something.

00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:04.789
Excuse me.

00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:07.792
Mi... Miyoung's stage is over.

00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:12.213
Do you know where she is? Did she leave?

00:11:13.214 --> 00:11:14.215
Well...

00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:16.968
- Over there--
- Hey.

00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:19.637
There are cigarette butts here.

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:21.014
I don't smoke, though.

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:23.766
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.102
Are you looking for Miyoung? She left.

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:27.312
Really? When?

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:30.064
A while ago. Her performance ended early.

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:32.108
- Right?
- Yes.

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:38.072
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

<i>The person you've dialed</i>

<i>- You'll be directed to voicemail.</i>

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:00.720
You see...

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:04.891
your singing skills

00:12:04.974 --> 00:12:08.102
are more than enough
to deserve an investment.

00:12:14.609 --> 00:12:15.610
Then,

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:18.613
are you going to pay me each time?

00:12:20.114 --> 00:12:22.116
As long as you want.

00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:27.956
Talk to me if you need anything.

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:29.040
Oh, right.

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:32.752
Get yourself a new purse and new clothes.

00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:36.589
You need to upgrade your look
if you want to change your mind.

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:44.305
Then, I won't take it.

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:49.852
I don't want to change.

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:51.771
And I don't want to sing like this.

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:54.399
You're being a little rude.

00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:56.484
You were rude to me first.

00:12:57.068 --> 00:12:58.403
I tried my best to be polite.

00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:01.406
I'll be going.

00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:05.118
I'm not someone who can be bought.

00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:07.787
Give it to me.

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:09.956
Give it to me.
What are you doing?

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:12.166
Let go! What's wrong with you?

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.251
Cheonho!

00:13:16.587 --> 00:13:17.714
Let her go.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:23.261
Give her the bag too.

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:38.443
This kind of attitude

00:13:39.193 --> 00:13:41.320
won't get you anywhere further in life.

00:13:42.363 --> 00:13:44.240
Since you're a singer, you must know.

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:47.702
Guess why people love beautiful lyrics.

00:13:53.458 --> 00:13:55.251
Because they don't happen in real life.

00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:25.740
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:27.992
<i>I'm worried. Call me.</i>

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:39.605
What is it? Did something happen?

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:41.774
No.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:43.985
Nothing happened.

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:49.365
I'm just grateful to have you.

00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:55.621
Why did you do it?

00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:00.543
Was it all because of me?

00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:04.255
Why did you do that for someone like me?

00:16:09.093 --> 00:16:10.094
I don't regret it.

00:16:12.388 --> 00:16:13.514
You got hurt.

00:16:14.849 --> 00:16:16.100
They broke your heart.

00:16:18.352 --> 00:16:20.271
If anyone tries to hurt you again,

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:23.983
I'm going to do just that.

00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:09.028
Come out, you bastards.

00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:12.448
Come out!

00:17:14.242 --> 00:17:15.326
Come out!

00:17:23.626 --> 00:17:25.628
It's Seokcheol.
Hey, open the doors.

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:27.672
- Open up.
- Open the doors!

00:17:29.131 --> 00:17:30.132
Who's that dude?

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:45.982
<i>Well...</i>

00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:04.417
<i>You need to tell me</i>
<i>so I can help you.</i>

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.336
There must've been a reason
behind smashing things

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.921
and beating people up here.

00:18:09.005 --> 00:18:11.757
Everyone who got beaten was hospitalized.

00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:14.844
Their parents won't settle.
They're eager to sue you.

00:18:16.178 --> 00:18:19.307
Tell me why you beat them up.

00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:21.934
I wanted them to be in pain.

00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:25.896
I thought those bullies
would also feel pain.

00:18:26.689 --> 00:18:28.357
So,

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:32.653
who did they bully and how?

00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:36.282
If you keep your mouth shut,
your life will be doomed.

00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:38.826
If this becomes a criminal case,
there'll be no settling.

00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:41.579
You'll be expelled
and sent to a reformatory.

00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:47.710
I wouldn't mind

00:18:50.254 --> 00:18:52.173
if my life became a mess.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.689
<i>Pros about being a nurse in the States?</i>

00:21:13.773 --> 00:21:17.193
<i>Above all, you have</i>
<i>a lot of free time for yourself.</i>

00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:20.154
-
<i>- More time to study as a nurse.</i>

00:21:20.237 --> 00:21:21.864
<i>More time to spend for yourself.</i>

00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:26.619
<i>And above all, you get to have</i>
<i>many incomparable experiences</i>

00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:27.703
<i>as a nurse.</i>

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:29.747
<i>The work environment is good too.</i>

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:31.916
<i>- They've a thorough work-dividing system.</i>

00:21:31.999 --> 00:21:34.293
<i>- So, you can focus only on patients.</i>

00:21:37.171 --> 00:21:39.799
Must you lie down there of all places?

00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:41.509
Will you get out of my room?

00:21:42.092 --> 00:21:43.928
Aren't you going to the hospital today?

00:21:44.011 --> 00:21:46.722
- I feel uncomfortable with you here.
- I'm going to go.

00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:49.725
Are you going to stay down there?

00:21:56.023 --> 00:21:58.275
Seokhee, this is

00:21:59.276 --> 00:22:01.654
like a prison cell with no bars.

00:22:01.737 --> 00:22:03.322
Maybe it's worse than prison.

00:22:03.405 --> 00:22:05.866
I can't request a visitation
even if I miss Hyeonggeun.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:09.036
If you went to jail,
would you ask him to come visit you?

00:22:09.119 --> 00:22:10.704
That would be quite a scene.

00:22:10.788 --> 00:22:11.914
I shouldn't.

00:22:11.997 --> 00:22:16.293
Stop being silly,
and tell me about your plans.

00:22:16.377 --> 00:22:17.920
Like long-term life plans.

00:22:18.003 --> 00:22:19.421
I've got lots of life plans.

00:22:19.505 --> 00:22:22.007
Short-term and long-term plans.

00:22:22.591 --> 00:22:23.592
Tell me a few.

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:31.433
I can't bring myself to share them
because you don't trust me.

00:22:31.517 --> 00:22:33.394
- Then, don't.
- I will.

00:22:35.729 --> 00:22:38.858
No matter how much I think,
there's nothing for me to do here.

00:22:38.941 --> 00:22:39.984
So,

00:22:41.443 --> 00:22:43.696
I want you to send me back
to the gambling house.

00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:46.198
Are you out of your mind?

00:22:46.282 --> 00:22:47.825
No, I'm not.

00:22:47.908 --> 00:22:51.579
You're really
getting on my nerves again.

00:22:51.662 --> 00:22:55.666
Seokhee. As you know,
Jeongnim used to be a car pawnbroker.

00:22:55.749 --> 00:22:58.294
She took cars from gamblers
and lent them money.

00:22:58.377 --> 00:22:59.795
It's quite profitable, you see.

00:22:59.879 --> 00:23:01.964
It's different from a regular pawnbroker.

00:23:02.047 --> 00:23:03.757
It makes a lot of money.

00:23:03.841 --> 00:23:05.467
I used to run errands for her.

00:23:05.551 --> 00:23:07.761
I issued documents for a smooth process.

00:23:07.845 --> 00:23:10.180
It can be done online these days.

00:23:10.264 --> 00:23:12.182
- And I have my own know-how.
- So?

00:23:13.183 --> 00:23:15.019
You'll crawl back there?

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.314
I don't think I can do another job.

00:23:18.731 --> 00:23:20.107
But this is something I learned.

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:22.860
So? So what if you make a fortune?

00:23:22.943 --> 00:23:25.112
You'll gamble it away again!

00:23:25.195 --> 00:23:27.364
Don't even get started.

00:23:27.448 --> 00:23:28.449
Gosh!

00:23:47.551 --> 00:23:48.636
<i>Seokkyung,</i>

00:23:48.719 --> 00:23:52.473
<i>I'm going to cut off</i>
<i>my ill-fated ties with you.</i>

00:23:52.556 --> 00:23:56.268
<i>I'll never reach out to you after today.</i>

00:23:56.352 --> 00:23:57.353
What the...

00:23:57.436 --> 00:23:59.605
<i>Let's never meet again</i>
<i>in this gambling scene.</i>

00:23:59.688 --> 00:24:02.107
<i>- Take care, you witch.</i>

00:24:03.525 --> 00:24:04.610
BYEONGSOO

00:24:04.693 --> 00:24:07.029
<i>Good morning.</i>
<i>I hope you have a pleasant day.</i>

00:24:12.993 --> 00:24:14.995
PARK SEOKKYUNG

00:24:27.007 --> 00:24:29.969
- Aren't you going for duty, sir?
- I should be.

00:24:30.052 --> 00:24:32.846
Right, I should be. Let's go!

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:33.973
See you later.

00:24:34.056 --> 00:24:35.099
Let's go!

00:24:35.641 --> 00:24:36.642
What the...

00:24:38.435 --> 00:24:40.479
MYOUNGSAN INDUSTRIES

00:24:56.996 --> 00:24:57.997
Come in.

00:25:00.124 --> 00:25:01.959
- Hi.
- Hi, Seokcheol.

00:25:02.042 --> 00:25:03.293
Come in, sit down.

00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:07.047
Come here and take a seat.

00:25:07.131 --> 00:25:08.549
So, did you give it a lot of...

00:25:08.632 --> 00:25:10.384
I mean, did you make up your mind?

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:12.761
Yes.

00:25:13.303 --> 00:25:15.848
This liquor was discontinued last year.

00:25:16.348 --> 00:25:18.183
It won't be made again for 10 years.

00:25:18.267 --> 00:25:19.309
Is that right?

00:25:22.312 --> 00:25:23.313
I was planning

00:25:24.606 --> 00:25:26.984
to open it after taking Taehoon down.

00:25:27.526 --> 00:25:30.988
- But let's drink some.
- Sounds good, sir.

00:25:33.741 --> 00:25:34.783
Here.

00:25:38.662 --> 00:25:39.830
Thank you.

00:25:44.168 --> 00:25:46.003
Let's enjoy the rest afterwards.

00:25:46.086 --> 00:25:49.173
We'll talk about our victory over it.

00:25:49.256 --> 00:25:50.549
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

00:25:50.632 --> 00:25:52.634
All right, let's drink.

00:25:52.718 --> 00:25:54.094
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:26:01.769 --> 00:26:04.813
What year was this produced? It's nice.

00:26:10.611 --> 00:26:11.945
Mr. Chairman.

00:26:12.571 --> 00:26:13.572
Yes.

00:26:14.448 --> 00:26:15.991
Did you give it a lot of thought?

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.205
Yes.

00:26:23.707 --> 00:26:25.084
I've thought long enough,

00:26:25.918 --> 00:26:27.419
but this doesn't feel right.

00:26:28.504 --> 00:26:30.297
Hey, you damn...

00:26:31.048 --> 00:26:33.842
I know that Kang Taehoon humiliated you.

00:26:34.551 --> 00:26:35.594
Still,

00:26:36.929 --> 00:26:37.971
this is wrong.

00:26:39.389 --> 00:26:40.808
So, you can't do it?

00:26:44.937 --> 00:26:46.188
I'm sorry.

00:26:46.271 --> 00:26:49.274
Park Seokcheol,
is this how you're going to behave?

00:27:07.709 --> 00:27:09.169
Get out, you punk.

00:27:12.005 --> 00:27:14.341
I don't even want to see you, so get out.

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:43.161
I apologize, sir.
I'll talk to him and make him understand.

00:27:43.745 --> 00:27:44.830
Pathetic loser.

00:27:45.622 --> 00:27:46.623
You too, get out.

00:28:14.484 --> 00:28:15.569
You wanted to see me?

00:28:16.612 --> 00:28:17.905
What's the matter with you?

00:28:18.822 --> 00:28:20.407
Is this how you behave?

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:21.575
Look.

00:28:22.284 --> 00:28:26.371
You won't get the money
I promised you, okay?

00:28:27.664 --> 00:28:30.375
You're pondering over nothing.

00:28:31.501 --> 00:28:34.087
Those bastards played dirty with us first.

00:28:34.171 --> 00:28:36.465
What's the use
of keeping your pride alone?

00:28:36.548 --> 00:28:40.969
Kang Taehoon, that scum,
needs to be erased from this world!

00:28:45.807 --> 00:28:47.100
- Sir.
- What?

00:28:47.184 --> 00:28:49.353
What happened to Taehoon
was because of you.

00:28:51.772 --> 00:28:54.232
You came in between
the Chairman and Taehoon--

00:28:54.316 --> 00:28:55.317
You little...

00:28:57.069 --> 00:28:58.487
I did what, you punk?

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:00.197
What do you even know?

00:29:01.907 --> 00:29:03.241
God damn it!

00:29:10.123 --> 00:29:11.166
I mean,

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:14.461
why do we have to go through this
because of him?

00:29:15.545 --> 00:29:17.172
Unbelievable.

00:29:18.507 --> 00:29:19.508
Okay.

00:29:21.677 --> 00:29:24.012
Let it go.

00:29:24.096 --> 00:29:25.681
I got too worked up just now.

00:29:27.224 --> 00:29:29.851
But you should listen carefully.

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:32.896
I was bound to be
the director of this company,

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.983
and Kang Taehoon
was to be discarded anyway.

00:29:36.608 --> 00:29:37.609
Got it?

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.238
So, are you planning to get rid of me too?

00:29:41.655 --> 00:29:42.656
What?

00:29:42.739 --> 00:29:44.866
Is that why you ordered me to kill him?

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:46.410
Why don't you do it yourself?

00:29:46.493 --> 00:29:49.413
You little...

00:29:49.496 --> 00:29:51.081
- Damn.
- Hey.

00:29:51.581 --> 00:29:52.708
Come back here.

00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:54.584
- Damn it!
- Come back here, you punk.

00:30:08.682 --> 00:30:10.726
MANAGER YOON ILJOONG OF NILBANA

00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:20.235
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, Miyoung.</i>

00:30:20.318 --> 00:30:21.695
<i>It's me, Nilbana's manager.</i>

00:30:21.778 --> 00:30:24.072
People are going crazy about you.

00:30:24.156 --> 00:30:26.366
They love you.

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:28.744
<i>Come early today</i>
<i>so we can talk about your payment.</i>

00:30:28.827 --> 00:30:31.371
<i>The Chairman wants to pay you double.</i>

00:30:31.455 --> 00:30:35.042
I knew you'd make it when I first saw you.

00:30:35.125 --> 00:30:36.960
Come to work early today, okay?

00:30:37.419 --> 00:30:40.130
- Sir.
<i>- What is it? Go on.</i>

00:30:41.256 --> 00:30:43.675
I'm afraid I can't work there anymore.

00:30:44.217 --> 00:30:45.218
What?

00:30:46.845 --> 00:30:48.680
What are you talking about?

00:30:48.764 --> 00:30:50.557
<i>Why? Is the payment too less?</i>

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.309
<i>Or do you want to perform longer?</i>

00:30:52.392 --> 00:30:55.062
No. It's not that I can't.

00:30:55.145 --> 00:30:56.480
I don't want to.

00:30:56.563 --> 00:30:57.731
Thanks for everything.

00:30:57.814 --> 00:30:58.940
No, wait.

00:30:59.691 --> 00:31:02.027
If this is about yesterday,
please don't worry.

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:03.445
It was just a misunderstanding.

00:31:03.528 --> 00:31:05.989
<i>The Chairman didn't mean anything by it.</i>

00:31:06.073 --> 00:31:07.657
<i>He's just a big fan of yours.</i>

00:31:07.741 --> 00:31:09.159
That wasn't how I felt.

00:31:09.576 --> 00:31:13.163
Please tell the Chairman
that I won't sing there anymore.

00:31:13.705 --> 00:31:14.706
<i>I'm hanging up.</i>

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:16.792
<i>- Hello? Hell--</i>

00:31:27.594 --> 00:31:28.595
What did she say?

00:31:29.304 --> 00:31:30.388
Well...

00:31:32.474 --> 00:31:33.683
The thing is,

00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:39.397
she doesn't want to work here anymore.

00:31:40.232 --> 00:31:42.818
She asked me to tell you.

00:31:45.195 --> 00:31:47.823
I'll reach out to her again
and persuade her.

00:31:47.906 --> 00:31:49.991
That's okay. You can get back to work.

00:31:50.992 --> 00:31:51.993
Yes, sir.

00:31:59.835 --> 00:32:01.795
Now, she's making me intrigued.

00:32:08.301 --> 00:32:10.554
Great job!

00:32:10.637 --> 00:32:12.305
It's a really hard one this time.

00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:13.390
Listen.

00:32:16.768 --> 00:32:17.769
Ready, go.

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:25.443
Nice! All of you are like real singers.

00:32:26.945 --> 00:32:30.824
My daughter is good at singing,
and she's pretty.

00:32:32.284 --> 00:32:34.786
Since she was little,
we sang a lot together.

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:37.372
We'd sing and dance together.

00:32:37.455 --> 00:32:39.791
What's her name?

00:32:41.459 --> 00:32:42.836
Kang Miyoung.

00:32:43.587 --> 00:32:45.213
I'm Miyoung.

00:32:45.881 --> 00:32:48.550
I'm your daughter, Miyoung.
I'm right here.

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:54.389
My daughter is prettier.

00:32:54.931 --> 00:32:57.726
My daughter's lips...

00:33:01.438 --> 00:33:02.522
Her eyes...

00:33:06.818 --> 00:33:08.111
Right, you're my daughter.

00:33:09.529 --> 00:33:11.615
Thanks for remembering me, Mom.

00:33:17.662 --> 00:33:18.663
SAMJUN E&amp;C

00:33:18.747 --> 00:33:20.916
Why did you call a singer
in private?

00:33:20.999 --> 00:33:23.710
You know why. The Chairman is into her.

00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:26.796
She was offered a wad of cash,

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.174
but she didn't even drink,
and threw a fit to leave.

00:33:29.257 --> 00:33:33.762
Are you talking about the girl
who sings at Nilbana?

00:33:33.845 --> 00:33:36.306
Yes, her name is Miyoung or something.

00:33:36.932 --> 00:33:37.933
Damn it.

00:33:39.559 --> 00:33:44.064
<i>♪ I bet everything I had ♪</i>

00:33:47.442 --> 00:33:50.528
<i>♪ That I'd show you ♪</i>

00:33:50.612 --> 00:33:54.282
<i>- ♪ How endless my love for you is ♪</i>

00:33:59.579 --> 00:34:01.414
Sir, I have something to tell you.

00:34:02.415 --> 00:34:03.416
What is it?

00:34:04.209 --> 00:34:05.543
I heard about yesterday.

00:34:06.503 --> 00:34:07.712
What about it?

00:34:08.672 --> 00:34:11.800
That you met the woman
who sings at Nilbana.

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:15.720
You punk, it's none of your business.

00:34:15.804 --> 00:34:16.972
The thing is,

00:34:18.556 --> 00:34:20.225
her boyfriend is...

00:34:23.603 --> 00:34:25.230
What about her boyfriend?

00:34:26.106 --> 00:34:27.816
It's Park Seokcheol, sir.

00:34:30.235 --> 00:34:31.987
- Seokcheol?
- Yes.

00:34:32.904 --> 00:34:34.698
- Park Seokcheol?
- Yes, sir.

00:34:34.781 --> 00:34:36.408
You should've told me sooner, punk!

00:34:36.491 --> 00:34:37.492
Pardon?

00:34:38.785 --> 00:34:39.786
What?

00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:42.330
Well...

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:44.833
You're dismissed.

00:34:56.094 --> 00:34:57.095
Goodness.

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:01.641
What do I do?

00:35:10.442 --> 00:35:11.526
- Thank you.
- No problem.

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:12.611
Good-bye.

00:35:15.196 --> 00:35:16.197
Mr. Jang Hak?

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:19.618
Mr. Jang Hak!

00:35:19.701 --> 00:35:20.702
Yes!

00:35:22.996 --> 00:35:24.581
This way, please.

00:35:24.664 --> 00:35:25.665
Okay.

00:35:41.806 --> 00:35:43.016
This way, please.

00:35:43.099 --> 00:35:44.100
Oh, okay.

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.061
Thank you.

00:35:51.232 --> 00:35:53.693
You have
a herniated cervical disc.

00:35:55.945 --> 00:35:58.490
It's already degenerative,
and you're only 26.

00:36:00.533 --> 00:36:04.120
And you recently got
your ACL operated on here.

00:36:04.204 --> 00:36:05.288
Goodness.

00:36:05.789 --> 00:36:07.332
I see you're a regular here.

00:36:07.415 --> 00:36:09.584
It's not good to be a regular
at a hospital.

00:36:09.668 --> 00:36:13.004
My job involves physical activities.

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:14.881
I'm a jujitsu fighter.

00:36:14.964 --> 00:36:16.007
Jujitsu?

00:36:16.091 --> 00:36:17.926
Don't you do a lot of sparring?

00:36:19.094 --> 00:36:22.180
You better be more careful
with your health.

00:36:22.263 --> 00:36:23.807
For someone young, you already...

00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:26.434
I see you never got treated fully.

00:36:26.518 --> 00:36:29.104
You need to complete the treatment.

00:36:29.187 --> 00:36:31.398
Right. From now on,

00:36:31.481 --> 00:36:33.983
- I'll go through my treatment faithfully.
- Good.

00:36:34.067 --> 00:36:38.113
The nurse here is so kind and pretty.

00:36:41.783 --> 00:36:42.867
Excuse me?

00:36:45.745 --> 00:36:47.414
No, please don't get me wrong.

00:36:48.206 --> 00:36:51.167
I don't say this to just anyone.

00:36:52.377 --> 00:36:53.878
I'm sorry if it was offensive.

00:36:54.671 --> 00:36:55.672
I apologize.

00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:59.092
Well, it's okay.

00:37:02.804 --> 00:37:05.557
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?

00:37:06.307 --> 00:37:08.935
You need to take the treatment seriously.

00:37:09.561 --> 00:37:11.146
Okay.

00:37:12.063 --> 00:37:13.273
- Seriously.
- Right.

00:37:14.607 --> 00:37:15.984
I understand.

00:37:16.067 --> 00:37:17.944
Can I go now?

00:37:18.027 --> 00:37:19.154
Yes, you can.

00:37:19.237 --> 00:37:20.280
Thanks.

00:37:25.118 --> 00:37:26.202
After you.

00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:29.956
Gosh, it's okay. I can do this much.

00:37:31.499 --> 00:37:32.500
There.

00:37:38.465 --> 00:37:40.467
You have physical therapy to get to.

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:42.135
It's around the corner there.

00:37:42.218 --> 00:37:43.219
I see.

00:37:44.679 --> 00:37:46.347
Nurse Park Seokhee.

00:37:50.268 --> 00:37:51.478
The therapy room is that way.

00:37:52.896 --> 00:37:55.190
Okay, I'll see you again.

00:37:55.273 --> 00:37:56.316
See you.

00:37:59.819 --> 00:38:00.820
Bye.

00:38:01.946 --> 00:38:04.073
He's young, but he can define beauty.

00:38:05.533 --> 00:38:06.826
What's with that guy?

00:38:08.203 --> 00:38:10.497
What are you doing? Go inside.

00:38:13.082 --> 00:38:14.292
He's ridiculous.

00:38:14.375 --> 00:38:16.127
How dare he hit on a nurse?

00:38:17.212 --> 00:38:19.422
He wasn't. He just thinks I'm pretty.

00:38:19.506 --> 00:38:20.924
Yes, you're pretty.

00:38:21.007 --> 00:38:23.176
But he doesn't have to appreciate that.

00:38:23.259 --> 00:38:25.386
He's seriously ridiculous.

00:38:25.845 --> 00:38:27.430
- Where are you going?
- Restroom.

00:38:27.514 --> 00:38:30.016
Hurry up,
or there'll be a line at the pasta place.

00:38:30.099 --> 00:38:31.100
Okay.

00:38:33.228 --> 00:38:34.270
I saw you smile earlier.

00:38:42.946 --> 00:38:45.615
I told him not to keep coffee on his desk.

00:38:55.625 --> 00:38:57.043
ORTHOPEDICS CENTER

00:38:57.126 --> 00:38:58.336
Hello.

00:39:03.258 --> 00:39:04.968
He's just ridiculous.

00:39:13.518 --> 00:39:14.519
No.

00:39:15.728 --> 00:39:17.772
No, no, no.

00:39:26.781 --> 00:39:29.868
- Hey, you startled me.
- Why are you so startled?

00:39:29.951 --> 00:39:32.620
- Aren't we going to eat?
- That startled...

00:39:33.329 --> 00:39:36.207
I mean, I remember putting my coffee cup

00:39:37.625 --> 00:39:38.960
right here.

00:39:39.544 --> 00:39:42.088
But it's not here, surprisingly.

00:39:42.171 --> 00:39:43.339
Goodness.

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:45.383
Gosh, let's go.

00:39:48.344 --> 00:39:49.387
The gambling house?

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:50.972
What about them?

00:39:51.055 --> 00:39:54.601
Hey, the lady texted me.

00:39:54.684 --> 00:39:57.478
- <i>What did she say?</i>
- She wants to cut ties.

00:39:57.562 --> 00:40:00.398
- She told me not to repay her.
<i>- That's nice.</i>

00:40:00.899 --> 00:40:04.235
Are there any other weirdos
in the neighborhood out to find you?

00:40:05.278 --> 00:40:07.864
I don't think so.

00:40:07.947 --> 00:40:09.782
<i>If there are any, let me know. Okay?</i>

00:40:10.533 --> 00:40:11.534
Okay.

00:40:12.744 --> 00:40:14.203
- Byeongsoo.
<i>- Yes?</i>

00:40:14.287 --> 00:40:16.289
Was it perhaps your doing?

00:40:16.873 --> 00:40:19.042
Well, I happened to run into
this halibut-looking guy

00:40:19.125 --> 00:40:21.920
<i>who seemed like</i>
<i>he worked at a gambling house.</i>

00:40:22.003 --> 00:40:23.504
<i>So, I simply gave him a little warning.</i>

00:40:23.588 --> 00:40:25.381
I see.

00:40:26.299 --> 00:40:28.468
- Thanks for your help.
<i>- Seokkyung.</i>

00:40:28.551 --> 00:40:31.262
- Yes?
- Don't go back to that business again.

00:40:32.096 --> 00:40:34.724
You can easily quit gambling,
but you need to be willing.

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:37.310
<i>And you're too pretty</i>

00:40:38.227 --> 00:40:39.854
to work at a place like that.

00:40:39.938 --> 00:40:41.648
What are you saying? It's gross.

00:40:41.731 --> 00:40:42.815
Goodness.

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:45.777
Hey, where are you?

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:47.403
I'm patrolling near your house.

00:40:48.029 --> 00:40:49.489
- My house?
- Yes.

00:40:51.783 --> 00:40:52.867
Wait. Hold up.

00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:58.081
Where?

00:40:58.998 --> 00:40:59.999
Here.

00:41:02.335 --> 00:41:04.295
Hey, Byeongsoo.

00:41:06.255 --> 00:41:09.175
Why are you going the extra mile for me?

00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:11.427
I told you.

00:41:12.136 --> 00:41:13.680
Out of my long-time love for you.

00:41:14.889 --> 00:41:15.890
Love?

00:41:16.307 --> 00:41:17.350
Gosh.

00:41:17.433 --> 00:41:19.435
Look. Love can't be this easy.

00:41:19.519 --> 00:41:21.396
Must love be hard? Love is easy for me.

00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:23.648
My goodness.

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:28.027
Gosh, hey. I'm sick and tired of love.

00:41:28.111 --> 00:41:29.737
Don't talk about love to me.

00:41:30.446 --> 00:41:31.447
Unbelievable.

00:41:32.031 --> 00:41:33.741
Go. Go home and eat something.

00:41:34.909 --> 00:41:36.411
Love, my foot.

00:41:37.412 --> 00:41:38.538
Go. I'm hanging up.

00:41:38.621 --> 00:41:39.622
Bye.

00:41:45.253 --> 00:41:46.337
What on earth?

00:41:59.017 --> 00:42:00.810
Snap out of it.

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:11.571
This is delicious. Eat up.

00:42:11.654 --> 00:42:12.697
Okay.

00:42:17.326 --> 00:42:18.661
LEE SIEUN, MYOUNGSAN ART HALL

00:42:18.745 --> 00:42:19.746
Damn.

00:42:20.496 --> 00:42:21.956
I don't believe this guy.

00:42:23.791 --> 00:42:25.251
- Babe.
- Yes?

00:42:25.334 --> 00:42:26.669
Why don't we go see the sea?

00:42:27.545 --> 00:42:28.546
The sea?

00:42:29.255 --> 00:42:30.715
Sure, when should we go?

00:42:31.299 --> 00:42:32.884
How about Saturday? The 27th.

00:42:33.634 --> 00:42:34.635
Saturday?

00:42:36.012 --> 00:42:37.013
Okay.

00:42:37.805 --> 00:42:38.806
Are you sure?

00:42:39.599 --> 00:42:41.851
Of course. Why? I have no plans that day.

00:42:43.644 --> 00:42:44.812
I see.

00:42:44.896 --> 00:42:45.980
That's great.

00:42:46.064 --> 00:42:47.940
I also said we should go enjoy the sea.

00:42:48.024 --> 00:42:49.942
Remember the pension I mentioned?

00:42:50.026 --> 00:42:51.194
That place...

00:42:54.155 --> 00:42:55.239
Wait.

00:42:58.117 --> 00:43:00.244
I can't make it that day. I have plans.

00:43:00.328 --> 00:43:03.206
Tsk! I'm meeting my college friends.
I forgot.

00:43:03.956 --> 00:43:05.458
Let's go next week, okay?

00:43:08.127 --> 00:43:10.421
I'm suddenly feeling hot.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:14.258
It suddenly feels extremely hot.

00:43:14.967 --> 00:43:16.969
Let's go next week.

00:43:18.513 --> 00:43:19.514
It's so hot in here.

Your health insurance payment records

It's much better
to hear you sing outside.

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:30.306
It was amazing.

00:47:30.389 --> 00:47:31.891
I should've tried it sooner.

00:47:33.351 --> 00:47:35.603
Aren't you working at Nilbana today?

00:47:35.686 --> 00:47:37.480
Ah, today...

00:47:38.689 --> 00:47:41.025
I'm going to stop working at Nilbana.

00:47:41.108 --> 00:47:42.943
Why? Did something happen?

00:47:43.819 --> 00:47:45.988
- Did the manager--
- No, that's not it.

00:47:46.072 --> 00:47:48.324
It was a good experience.

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:51.869
I'm going to look for a better place.
Maybe in Hongdae.

00:47:54.288 --> 00:47:56.791
Right. You're too good
to stay in one place.

00:47:56.874 --> 00:47:58.459
You should sing on a bigger stage.

00:47:58.542 --> 00:48:00.461
Why don't we try a broadcasting station?

00:48:00.544 --> 00:48:02.588
That's not how it works.

00:48:02.671 --> 00:48:04.590
I'll keep writing songs,

00:48:04.673 --> 00:48:06.425
busk on the streets like this,

00:48:07.134 --> 00:48:08.511
and take vocal lessons too.

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:11.180
You need vocal lessons too?

00:48:11.263 --> 00:48:13.099
Of course, I have to make an effort.

00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:16.185
That's admirable and cool.

00:48:16.977 --> 00:48:19.563
A chance is given only to those who try.

00:48:19.647 --> 00:48:22.274
Of all things, I have faith in this.

00:48:25.444 --> 00:48:27.321
I'm so proud of you, Miyoung.

00:48:32.576 --> 00:48:34.620
- Did something happen?
- Mmm-mmm.

00:48:36.122 --> 00:48:37.123
I'm just

00:48:38.124 --> 00:48:39.542
happy to have you.

00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:50.511
Well...

00:49:03.816 --> 00:49:04.817


00:49:11.157 --> 00:49:12.158
Sir.

00:49:14.577 --> 00:49:15.661
Hey.

00:49:19.999 --> 00:49:21.709
<i>I came to ask you for advice.</i>

00:49:23.335 --> 00:49:26.505
You told me when you retired

00:49:27.131 --> 00:49:30.301
that I should come and ask you for advice
if I needed to make a decision

00:49:31.385 --> 00:49:32.970
about something I'd regret.

00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:35.931
Right.

00:49:36.932 --> 00:49:38.267
I did.

00:49:39.143 --> 00:49:42.438
I told you to be patient at all times.

00:49:43.189 --> 00:49:44.190
Right.

00:49:44.648 --> 00:49:45.649
But then...

00:49:48.068 --> 00:49:51.447
I've reached the limit of my patience.

00:49:52.615 --> 00:49:54.074
What do you think I should do

00:49:55.868 --> 00:49:57.119
about Kang Taehoon?

00:50:01.916 --> 00:50:03.209
Yes, hello.

00:50:03.834 --> 00:50:05.085
Yes.

00:50:05.628 --> 00:50:07.421
Everything's the same with me.

00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:10.716
Yes. Do you have a moment to talk?

00:50:12.885 --> 00:50:14.428
All right.

00:50:15.763 --> 00:50:18.974
<i>I'll put you through to someone</i>
<i>so you two can talk.</i>

00:50:28.359 --> 00:50:29.777
<i>This is Changsoo.</i>

00:50:37.201 --> 00:50:39.203
Let's talk in person.

00:50:52.466 --> 00:50:54.051
SANGYEOL

00:51:01.058 --> 00:51:02.977
- One moment.
- What?

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:08.315
Hello, Mr. Chairman. It's me.

00:51:11.151 --> 00:51:12.736
Is that true?

00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:13.946
Yes.

00:51:14.488 --> 00:51:17.116
I went to visit your father
and discussed it with him.

00:51:17.825 --> 00:51:20.286
I decided to make peace with Taehoon.

00:51:22.162 --> 00:51:24.123
I'm glad you did.

00:51:24.206 --> 00:51:26.667
And I'm sorry for being harsh earlier.

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:27.751
Don't take it to heart.

00:51:29.128 --> 00:51:30.546
It's all right, sir.

00:51:31.422 --> 00:51:33.382
We need to be on good terms with Taehoon

00:51:33.465 --> 00:51:35.634
to be able to proceed
with the third district again.

00:51:35.718 --> 00:51:37.511
Let's think long-term, Seokcheol.

00:51:41.974 --> 00:51:42.975
Thank you.

00:51:43.058 --> 00:51:44.268
Don't mention it.

00:51:44.351 --> 00:51:47.605
Remember the restaurant in Gamyoung
we often went to?

00:51:47.688 --> 00:51:48.981
<i>Come straight there.</i>

00:51:49.064 --> 00:51:50.316
Yes, I'll be right there.

00:51:50.399 --> 00:51:52.234
<i>- Okay.</i>

00:51:57.114 --> 00:51:58.699
I need to go meet the Chairman.

00:52:00.117 --> 00:52:01.952
Didn't you say you'd quit?

00:52:02.536 --> 00:52:04.079
I will quit after this.

00:52:05.164 --> 00:52:06.999
I'm not just saying it. Don't worry.

00:52:10.919 --> 00:52:12.921
DAKGALBI

00:52:13.005 --> 00:52:15.382
Discipline the boys
so I won't be criticized.

00:52:16.717 --> 00:52:18.260
Damn it.

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:29.188
I wondered where to go

00:52:30.481 --> 00:52:33.484
and decided to call you here
to talk about the good old days.

00:52:35.235 --> 00:52:36.236
Right.

00:52:36.904 --> 00:52:38.238
This place hasn't changed.

00:52:40.616 --> 00:52:43.369
And you still have sashimi
at a barbecue place.

00:52:44.828 --> 00:52:47.998
We could've talked on the phone.
Why bother seeing each other?

00:52:50.918 --> 00:52:51.919
Taehoon.

00:52:52.378 --> 00:52:53.379
Go on.

00:52:55.464 --> 00:52:56.924
Let's put the past behind us

00:52:57.591 --> 00:52:58.801
and start anew.

00:52:59.551 --> 00:53:01.720
I'll forget about what you did to me.

00:53:01.804 --> 00:53:03.305
Forget about the past

00:53:04.181 --> 00:53:05.307
so we can make peace.

00:53:05.849 --> 00:53:09.728
The neighborhood's redevelopment
can't be handled alone anyway.

00:53:12.189 --> 00:53:13.440
It can't be done alone...

00:53:16.902 --> 00:53:17.903
for you.

00:53:20.823 --> 00:53:22.574
But I can do it.

00:53:23.409 --> 00:53:26.537
And I have no reason to face those
who make me feel uncomfortable.

00:53:29.373 --> 00:53:32.918
Behave yourself
and listen to your elder, you punk.

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:39.133
I see you're acting high and mighty
around the Chairman.

00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:42.636
You seem confident.

00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:45.848
Bring it on.

00:53:48.809 --> 00:53:49.810
Sir.

00:53:52.271 --> 00:53:53.897
Be wise in choosing your people.

00:53:55.399 --> 00:53:58.277
Things aren't working out for you
because of that weasel, Sangyeol.

00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:00.404
- Stand up, you punk.
- Calm down.

00:54:08.787 --> 00:54:09.788
Taehoon.

00:54:10.622 --> 00:54:13.417
Let me ask you one last time.

00:54:21.216 --> 00:54:22.468
Take this glass,

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:26.555
and agree to make a fresh start.

00:54:29.099 --> 00:54:30.100
Okay?

00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:36.607
I'm trying to make peace with you.

00:54:37.274 --> 00:54:38.442
Must I even beg?

00:55:12.851 --> 00:55:15.979
Damn, you should've
at least brought hard liquor.

00:55:18.273 --> 00:55:20.651
I don't drink soju anymore.
It reminds me of the past.

00:55:21.818 --> 00:55:23.820
I lose myself when I think about the past.

00:55:24.196 --> 00:55:25.197
You know why?

00:55:26.406 --> 00:55:27.491
Kim Changsoo!

00:55:28.784 --> 00:55:32.204
The fact that I dedicated my life to you
drives me insane.

00:55:34.456 --> 00:55:35.457
You little...

00:55:43.799 --> 00:55:45.842
What? Are you scared?

00:55:48.554 --> 00:55:49.555
Don't move!

00:55:52.808 --> 00:55:53.809
Sangyeol.

00:55:54.476 --> 00:55:56.937
Why won't you do anything?
You seemed fearless earlier.

00:55:58.105 --> 00:55:59.690
Your boss must be disappointed.

00:56:03.277 --> 00:56:04.278
What should I do?

00:56:05.737 --> 00:56:07.197
Should I stick it in or not?

00:56:18.041 --> 00:56:19.042
Try me.

00:56:20.586 --> 00:56:22.588
Wield your knife the wrong way,

00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:26.049
and I'll kill you. Try me.

00:56:33.015 --> 00:56:34.016
This is enough.

00:56:41.398 --> 00:56:42.399
Okay.

00:56:45.485 --> 00:56:46.612
Let's stop here.

00:56:51.283 --> 00:56:52.492
Kang Taehoon.

00:56:52.951 --> 00:56:54.328
If you keep this up,

00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:58.040
you'll die early.

00:57:05.547 --> 00:57:06.798
And I hope you live long.

00:57:16.058 --> 00:57:17.309
Are you okay, sir?

00:57:45.712 --> 00:57:48.840
I've never been this humiliated
in my entire life, Sangyeol.

00:57:51.385 --> 00:57:52.386
What should we do?

00:57:57.391 --> 00:57:59.184
Find someone who'll take the knife.

00:58:01.019 --> 00:58:03.355
Someone ignorant,
someone who doesn't think.

00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:07.901
Someone who'd do anything for money.

00:58:09.194 --> 00:58:11.530
Yes, sir.

00:58:47.524 --> 00:58:50.527
