00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.960
(Adapted from the novel
"Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.880
(Episode 18, Don't You Know
If I Ever Loved You?)

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.320
Why are you so cute?

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.800
What should I name you?

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.280
Are you hungry?

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.600
Why are you ignoring me?

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.120
Hey.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.880
Where have you been?

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.000
Did you hang out with Wu Suo Wei?

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.600
Ever since I told Chi Cheng...

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.000
Wu Suo Wei is at our house,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.600
you two haven't practiced
martial arts at home.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.440
Did you practice secretly outside?

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.760
What is the meaning of this?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Are you even my brother?

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.640
Whether I'm your brother or not,

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.121
does it have anything to do
with my relationship with him?

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.000
I'm angry
because why are you so nice to him?

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.760
After all, he's an outsider.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
He's also my love rival.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.640
You can't side with outsiders!

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.080
Or am I...

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.800
the outsider?

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.800
Fine.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.840
You won't speak?

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.360
I'll tell our mom now.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.200
I'll tell her that her son...

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.976
is guarding
against his own brother...

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.720
in order to help an outsider!

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.040
In this world, how can...

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.120
Wang Zhen!

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.320
Are you freaking mute?

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.640
Listen. If you don't give me
an explanation today,

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.680
this matter isn't over!

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.560
Fine.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.120
Just pretend to be deaf and mute!

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.280
Say something!

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.840
Don't you guys love boxing?

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.800
I'm going to destroy everything!

00:04:39.375 --> 00:04:40.495
Come on, Green-Eyed Monster.

00:04:41.175 --> 00:04:42.855
Don't let your godfather's fumes
smoke you.

00:04:43.895 --> 00:04:44.895
Come to me.

00:05:08.373 --> 00:05:09.373
Why are you here again?

00:05:11.253 --> 00:05:12.253
It's been a while,

00:05:13.213 --> 00:05:14.213
so I came to see you.

00:05:18.373 --> 00:05:19.493
Thank you for your kindness.

00:05:20.093 --> 00:05:21.853
But I'd be more touched...

00:05:22.453 --> 00:05:23.813
if you create less trouble for me.

00:05:28.373 --> 00:05:30.173
You spent the night
at my place the other day.

00:05:30.253 --> 00:05:31.253
Did Chi Cheng get mad?

00:05:35.373 --> 00:05:36.373
He did.

00:05:37.613 --> 00:05:39.213
But his bark is worse than his bite.

00:05:41.453 --> 00:05:42.453
In the end,

00:05:42.813 --> 00:05:44.093
he still cares about me.

00:05:49.853 --> 00:05:51.733
You don't have to analyze
his personality to me.

00:05:52.453 --> 00:05:53.653
I know him better than you do.

00:06:03.693 --> 00:06:05.573
I told him to say
he doesn't love me to my face,

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:07.533
but he couldn't do it.

00:06:14.853 --> 00:06:15.853
Tell me.

00:06:16.453 --> 00:06:17.813
How soft-hearted is he?

00:06:30.733 --> 00:06:31.733
If I were him,

00:06:33.013 --> 00:06:34.052
I wouldn't easily abandon...

00:06:34.053 --> 00:06:35.533
someone who sincerely
loves me either.

00:06:39.613 --> 00:06:40.853
You're talking about sincerity?

00:06:41.813 --> 00:06:43.933
Don't associate
the word sincerity with me.

00:06:45.293 --> 00:06:46.373
After all, a few years ago,

00:06:46.533 --> 00:06:48.053
I was the one who just left.

00:06:52.613 --> 00:06:53.933
Don't belittle yourself too much.

00:06:54.933 --> 00:06:55.933
I think...

00:06:57.653 --> 00:06:58.813
you had your own reasons...

00:06:59.693 --> 00:07:01.173
for leaving back then.

00:07:05.533 --> 00:07:07.093
Continue to help me
clear my name then.

00:07:08.373 --> 00:07:09.373
Thank you.

00:07:12.813 --> 00:07:14.173
I know you're not a bad person.

00:07:15.853 --> 00:07:17.813
You've known about Yue Yue
and me for a long time.

00:07:17.853 --> 00:07:19.053
But you didn't tell Chi Cheng.

00:07:21.773 --> 00:07:23.293
I guess you're not a fool.

00:07:25.573 --> 00:07:26.573
In that case,

00:07:27.093 --> 00:07:28.093
as your senior,

00:07:28.253 --> 00:07:29.613
let me give you a piece of advice.

00:07:30.253 --> 00:07:31.773
Think carefully.

00:07:32.493 --> 00:07:33.693
If Chi Cheng...

00:07:33.973 --> 00:07:35.093
finds out about this,

00:07:36.053 --> 00:07:37.093
what will he do?

00:08:12.493 --> 00:08:13.493
Mrs. Wu.

00:08:19.693 --> 00:08:22.173
Mrs. Wu, I heard you haven't
been feeling well lately,

00:08:22.413 --> 00:08:23.693
so I especially came to see you.

00:08:24.213 --> 00:08:25.493
You are...

00:08:26.253 --> 00:08:27.613
I'm Yue Yue.

00:08:29.333 --> 00:08:31.349
Before this, I had planned to come
to your house for a meal.

00:08:31.373 --> 00:08:33.333
But then something came up
and I couldn't make it.

00:08:33.893 --> 00:08:34.893
I remember now.

00:08:35.493 --> 00:08:36.493
Have a seat, Mrs. Wu.

00:08:42.653 --> 00:08:43.653
Mrs. Wu.

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:44.892
What happened between me
and Wu Qi Qiong before...

00:08:44.893 --> 00:08:46.053
was just a misunderstanding.

00:08:46.533 --> 00:08:48.453
It's all because we were
too impulsive back then.

00:08:48.893 --> 00:08:49.893
In the past year,

00:08:49.933 --> 00:08:51.333
we've kept in touch.

00:08:51.453 --> 00:08:52.453
I miss him.

00:08:52.613 --> 00:08:54.093
He misses me too.

00:08:56.653 --> 00:08:58.813
Mrs. Wu, to be honest,

00:08:59.013 --> 00:09:00.733
we both want to get back together.

00:09:01.013 --> 00:09:03.333
But no one ever brought it up.

00:09:04.133 --> 00:09:05.493
He has his pride.

00:09:05.653 --> 00:09:07.389
And at that time,
I was the one who broke up with him.

00:09:07.413 --> 00:09:09.293
I'm sure he doesn't want
to bring this up first.

00:09:09.693 --> 00:09:11.013
But I'm a girl.

00:09:11.653 --> 00:09:12.973
I'm shy too.

00:09:16.173 --> 00:09:18.413
Mrs. Wu, please talk
to Da Qiong for me.

00:09:18.533 --> 00:09:20.453
I really want to reconcile with him.

00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:22.853
Well...

00:09:37.413 --> 00:09:38.413
- Here!
- Here!

00:09:39.533 --> 00:09:40.533
Cheng Yu.

00:09:40.933 --> 00:09:41.933
Happy birthday.

00:09:43.493 --> 00:09:44.493
Happy birthday.

00:09:49.853 --> 00:09:50.853
At this hour,

00:09:50.933 --> 00:09:52.133
why isn't Xiao Shuai here yet?

00:09:53.613 --> 00:09:54.613
Whether Xiao Shuai...

00:09:54.613 --> 00:09:55.613
comes or not...

00:09:55.613 --> 00:09:56.613
isn't important.

00:09:57.413 --> 00:09:59.133
What's important is that
it's your birthday.

00:10:00.013 --> 00:10:01.013
Yes.

00:10:02.533 --> 00:10:04.453
And it's our 10th anniversary.

00:10:07.493 --> 00:10:08.493
Ten years ago,

00:10:09.173 --> 00:10:10.733
we confirmed our relationship...

00:10:11.133 --> 00:10:12.293
at Cheng Yu's birthday party.

00:10:12.653 --> 00:10:13.653
Do you still remember?

00:10:15.493 --> 00:10:17.293
Tenth anniversary?

00:10:17.853 --> 00:10:20.693
You were only together
for a few years.

00:10:21.173 --> 00:10:23.333
And there's a huge gap in between.

00:10:24.013 --> 00:10:25.973
How dare you call it 10 years?

00:10:27.253 --> 00:10:28.493
To you,

00:10:28.893 --> 00:10:29.893
there might be a gap.

00:10:31.453 --> 00:10:32.453
But to me,

00:10:32.693 --> 00:10:33.693
there's none.

00:10:42.973 --> 00:10:43.973
Ten years.

00:10:45.213 --> 00:10:47.333
I'll put on a song
to liven up the mood.

00:11:00.533 --> 00:11:02.413
Ten years ago

00:11:03.933 --> 00:11:05.813
I didn't know you

00:12:01.293 --> 00:12:02.493
What are you doing, Wang Zhen?

00:12:04.293 --> 00:12:05.652
(Wang Zhen:
Are you still coming today?)

00:12:05.653 --> 00:12:07.934
(Wu Suo Wei: Yes, I just finished
working, be there soon!)

00:12:33.293 --> 00:12:34.773
So he can get angry too.

00:12:35.733 --> 00:12:36.933
He can go crazy.

00:12:37.973 --> 00:12:38.973
Just...

00:12:39.773 --> 00:12:40.773
not for me.

00:12:53.253 --> 00:12:54.253
As you can see,

00:12:55.973 --> 00:12:57.693
you're no match for me at all.

00:12:58.853 --> 00:13:00.093
Chi Cheng still cares about me.

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:03.093
I didn't even use my last trick.

00:13:08.493 --> 00:13:09.493
Cheng Yu!

00:13:11.333 --> 00:13:12.333
What are you doing?

00:13:39.413 --> 00:13:40.413
Da Wei.

00:13:40.413 --> 00:13:41.413
Where are you going?

00:13:42.533 --> 00:13:44.213
Don't overthink it.
They're just drunk.

00:13:44.653 --> 00:13:45.653
Don't worry.

00:13:46.093 --> 00:13:47.829
A journey of one hundred steps
is half finished at ninety.

00:13:47.853 --> 00:13:49.493
I'll get to the bottom of this.

00:15:09.893 --> 00:15:10.893
Guo Cheng Yu.

00:15:11.413 --> 00:15:12.413
Get up.

00:15:14.933 --> 00:15:15.933
Get up.

00:15:16.053 --> 00:15:17.733
- Come on.
- Come on.

00:15:18.453 --> 00:15:20.332
- Two little bees,
- Two little bees,

00:15:20.333 --> 00:15:21.932
- flying to the flower shrubs.
- Flying to the flower shrubs.

00:15:21.933 --> 00:15:22.933
- Flying to the left,
- Flying to the left,

00:15:22.933 --> 00:15:23.933
- flying to the right.
- Flying to the right.

00:15:23.933 --> 00:15:24.933
- Fly!
- Fly!

00:15:26.053 --> 00:15:27.053
- Fly!
- Fly!

00:15:28.533 --> 00:15:29.533
- Fly!
- Fly!

00:15:31.133 --> 00:15:32.133
I'll drink.

00:15:32.573 --> 00:15:33.933
I'll drink. I'm drunk.

00:15:37.453 --> 00:15:38.693
You've only drunk a little.

00:15:41.133 --> 00:15:42.133
Cheng Yu.

00:15:43.333 --> 00:15:44.333
Let's play some more.

00:15:45.893 --> 00:15:47.333
- I'll get going.
- Wang Shuo.

00:15:53.733 --> 00:15:54.733
Darn you.

00:15:55.133 --> 00:15:56.253
Why did you kiss him?

00:16:01.613 --> 00:16:02.613
Hey.

00:16:03.293 --> 00:16:05.173
You look quite cute...

00:16:05.813 --> 00:16:07.253
when you're drunk.

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:10.053
I'm the one taking care of you.

00:16:10.413 --> 00:16:11.413
Cheng Yu.

00:16:15.413 --> 00:16:16.693
Cheng Yu.

00:16:20.533 --> 00:16:21.533
Come back.

00:16:24.093 --> 00:16:25.093
Come back.

00:16:26.573 --> 00:16:27.573
Cheng Yu.

00:16:28.453 --> 00:16:29.493
Cheng Yu.

00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:48.973
Why did he go
to Guo Cheng Yu's room?

00:17:15.813 --> 00:17:17.133
What is Wang Shuo doing?

00:17:43.133 --> 00:17:45.333
Nothing happened all night.

00:17:48.613 --> 00:17:49.613
Cheng Yu.

00:17:57.013 --> 00:17:58.013
So...

00:17:58.453 --> 00:18:00.172
this is all just an act...

00:18:00.173 --> 00:18:01.733
by Wang Shuo?

00:18:42.853 --> 00:18:44.733
(Wei Wei)

00:18:49.413 --> 00:18:51.213
Pick up the phone, Wu Suo Wei.

00:19:00.813 --> 00:19:01.813
Mrs. Wu.

00:19:03.373 --> 00:19:04.773
Did Wu Suo Wei come home yesterday?

00:19:04.933 --> 00:19:05.933
Xiao Chi.

00:19:05.933 --> 00:19:06.933
Why are you here?

00:19:07.053 --> 00:19:09.653
Well, Da Qiong has been busy
with work in the past few days.

00:19:09.773 --> 00:19:11.053
He hasn't been home.

00:19:11.453 --> 00:19:12.893
What's wrong? What happened?

00:19:14.053 --> 00:19:15.053
It's nothing, Mrs. Wu.

00:19:21.173 --> 00:19:22.549
Are you feeling
unwell again, Mrs. Wu?

00:19:22.573 --> 00:19:23.573
No.

00:19:24.973 --> 00:19:26.533
I'm just troubled.

00:19:27.453 --> 00:19:29.613
Do you remember Da Qiong's
girlfriend of three years...

00:19:29.693 --> 00:19:32.133
that I told you about before?

00:19:33.333 --> 00:19:34.333
Two days ago,

00:19:34.893 --> 00:19:36.253
she came here to see me.

00:19:37.413 --> 00:19:38.413
Why did she come?

00:19:39.733 --> 00:19:40.733
She said...

00:19:40.933 --> 00:19:42.573
she can't forget Da Qiong.

00:19:42.653 --> 00:19:44.053
She wants to reconcile with him.

00:19:44.173 --> 00:19:46.053
She also said
they've always been in touch...

00:19:46.133 --> 00:19:47.333
since they broke up.

00:19:47.413 --> 00:19:49.773
And Da Qiong wants
to get back together with her too.

00:19:50.573 --> 00:19:53.053
She wants me to help them reconcile.

00:19:53.813 --> 00:19:54.813
Mrs. Wu.

00:19:55.933 --> 00:19:56.933
You said...

00:19:57.613 --> 00:19:58.773
they've always been in touch,

00:19:59.293 --> 00:20:00.493
and they want to reconcile?

00:20:01.053 --> 00:20:03.293
What's wrong with that girl?

00:20:04.213 --> 00:20:06.773
In the past,
she looked down on Da Qiong.

00:20:06.973 --> 00:20:09.493
Now that Da Qiong got promoted,

00:20:09.733 --> 00:20:11.053
she's back.

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:13.253
Tell me.

00:20:13.254 --> 00:20:14.493
Isn't this frustrating?

00:20:17.053 --> 00:20:18.053
What happened to your hand?

00:20:18.053 --> 00:20:19.053
Let me see.

00:20:19.293 --> 00:20:20.413
Mrs. Wu, I'm fine.

00:20:20.973 --> 00:20:22.093
It's just a scratch.

00:20:22.533 --> 00:20:23.772
You kids...

00:20:23.773 --> 00:20:25.213
should be more careful.

00:20:35.413 --> 00:20:36.413
Mrs. Wu.

00:20:38.013 --> 00:20:39.933
Haven't you always wanted
Da Qiong to get a wife?

00:20:40.653 --> 00:20:41.933
Now that she's come to you,

00:20:43.173 --> 00:20:44.173
why are you...

00:20:44.533 --> 00:20:45.533
feeling frustrated?

00:20:46.413 --> 00:20:47.613
Finding a wife...

00:20:47.893 --> 00:20:49.693
can't be rushed, right?

00:20:50.893 --> 00:20:52.453
You have to pick a good one.

00:20:52.773 --> 00:20:55.013
Not just anyone can do.

00:20:55.053 --> 00:20:56.053
Tell me.

00:20:56.054 --> 00:20:58.693
Can a girl like Yue Yue be his wife?

00:20:59.133 --> 00:21:00.333
How can she break up...

00:21:00.413 --> 00:21:02.013
and get back together
with him so easily?

00:21:02.373 --> 00:21:04.013
She's bullying Da Qiong...

00:21:04.493 --> 00:21:05.853
for having a good temper.

00:21:07.733 --> 00:21:08.733
Yue Yue?

00:21:10.493 --> 00:21:11.493
Is that a nickname?

00:21:12.373 --> 00:21:14.093
Her full name is Yue Yue.

00:21:38.693 --> 00:21:39.693
Wu Suo Wei.

00:21:41.893 --> 00:21:42.893
Wu Suo Wei!

00:22:31.733 --> 00:22:33.053
Maybe they have the same name.

00:22:34.973 --> 00:22:36.253
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

00:23:21.453 --> 00:23:24.613
(Bait Plan)

00:23:28.853 --> 00:23:33.573
(Earn big from Chi Cheng)

00:23:36.893 --> 00:23:40.453
(Chi Cheng, 28,
rich heir, loves keeping snakes)

00:23:42.573 --> 00:23:46.373
(Goal: Break them up!)

00:23:50.813 --> 00:23:53.693
(Goal: Break them up!)

00:23:58.893 --> 00:24:01.173
What an act.

00:24:01.973 --> 00:24:03.493
He's even in my dream.

00:24:04.493 --> 00:24:05.493
What act?

00:24:05.893 --> 00:24:07.893
I feel guilty.

00:24:14.813 --> 00:24:15.813
Why is she here?

00:24:18.053 --> 00:24:19.053
I should...

00:24:19.253 --> 00:24:20.253
ask you that.

00:24:21.493 --> 00:24:23.133
I had an ulterior motive...

00:24:23.533 --> 00:24:24.813
when I approached you back then.

00:24:26.333 --> 00:24:28.213
You knew I had a girlfriend
for three years?

00:24:28.373 --> 00:24:29.373
Do you know who she is?

00:24:31.773 --> 00:24:33.133
Back then, me and Yue...

00:24:33.613 --> 00:24:34.613
Yue what?

00:24:35.053 --> 00:24:36.053
I...

00:24:36.613 --> 00:24:37.613
I...

00:24:38.413 --> 00:24:40.373
I'm starting to think
you're frivolous.

00:24:44.253 --> 00:24:45.253
Why is she here again?

00:24:45.853 --> 00:24:47.349
Her new company
is undergoing renovation.

00:24:47.373 --> 00:24:48.452
After they broke up,

00:24:48.453 --> 00:24:49.613
they've always been in touch.

00:24:49.853 --> 00:24:52.173
And Da Qiong wants
to get back together with her too.

00:25:04.573 --> 00:25:06.853
(Ice cream, second one is half off!)

00:25:24.133 --> 00:25:25.133
You're still here?

00:25:37.013 --> 00:25:38.333
- Hello?
- Da Wei.

00:25:38.413 --> 00:25:39.589
Chi Cheng came
to the clinic just now.

00:25:39.613 --> 00:25:40.932
He even took out your box.

00:25:40.933 --> 00:25:41.933
Okay.

00:25:42.773 --> 00:25:43.773
I got it.

00:25:58.213 --> 00:25:59.213
After this,

00:26:00.333 --> 00:26:01.733
it's over for good.

00:27:15.333 --> 00:27:16.333
What is this?

00:27:19.893 --> 00:27:21.133
Can you explain it to me?

00:27:23.213 --> 00:27:24.213
Haven't you...

00:27:25.133 --> 00:27:26.133
already seen it?

00:27:28.493 --> 00:27:29.893
What did I see?

00:27:30.173 --> 00:27:31.173
You saw...

00:27:33.533 --> 00:27:34.653
my true intention...

00:27:35.093 --> 00:27:36.093
in approaching you.

00:27:41.733 --> 00:27:42.853
So...

00:27:44.613 --> 00:27:46.333
you've always been
in contact with her?

00:27:48.413 --> 00:27:50.694
Even after you broke up,
you've been thinking about her...

00:27:52.213 --> 00:27:53.693
and want to reconcile?

00:27:58.133 --> 00:27:59.573
Think whatever you want.

00:28:12.653 --> 00:28:13.653
Wu Suo Wei.

00:28:16.773 --> 00:28:18.092
I don't care...

00:28:18.093 --> 00:28:19.533
what your original intention was.

00:28:22.733 --> 00:28:24.453
We've been together for so long.

00:28:26.893 --> 00:28:28.172
You must have been...

00:28:28.173 --> 00:28:29.933
at least a little sincere to me.

00:28:41.533 --> 00:28:42.813
As long as you say yes,

00:28:46.653 --> 00:28:47.813
I'll let bygones be bygones.

00:28:56.613 --> 00:28:57.613
No.

00:29:11.853 --> 00:29:13.413
I dated you...

00:29:14.773 --> 00:29:16.773
just to get revenge
on you and Yue Yue.

00:29:18.533 --> 00:29:19.533
Now,

00:29:20.613 --> 00:29:23.173
I want to use your ways
to make money.

00:29:24.413 --> 00:29:25.933
Once I'm rich enough...

00:29:26.533 --> 00:29:28.133
to fulfill Yue Yue's requests,

00:29:29.413 --> 00:29:31.253
I'll get back together with her.

00:29:32.373 --> 00:29:33.733
I'm straight.

00:29:35.973 --> 00:29:37.853
Why should I be with you forever?

00:29:49.013 --> 00:29:50.013
Wu Suo Wei.

00:30:00.653 --> 00:30:01.653
You win.

00:30:03.493 --> 00:30:05.653
You're making me wish I were dead.

00:30:14.333 --> 00:30:15.333
You're really good.

00:30:15.334 --> 00:30:16.493
I accept my defeat.

00:30:17.733 --> 00:30:18.733
I deserve it.

00:30:20.093 --> 00:30:21.293
I brought this upon myself!

00:30:23.853 --> 00:30:25.733
You wish you were dead?

00:30:27.213 --> 00:30:28.413
Have you ever loved me?

00:30:29.493 --> 00:30:31.333
Ask yourself.

00:30:31.973 --> 00:30:32.973
Are these words...

00:30:33.693 --> 00:30:35.853
appropriate to use on me?

00:30:37.693 --> 00:30:38.693
Yes.

00:30:41.333 --> 00:30:42.533
I've never loved you.

00:30:45.013 --> 00:30:46.052
You slept over
at someone else's house,

00:30:46.053 --> 00:30:47.213
and I didn't fight with you.

00:30:49.933 --> 00:30:51.412
You flirted right under my nose,

00:30:51.413 --> 00:30:52.693
and I didn't even go off on you.

00:30:53.733 --> 00:30:56.213
Just scolding you
made me suffer for days.

00:30:57.453 --> 00:30:59.613
I'd rather kick you out
than yell at you.

00:31:04.013 --> 00:31:05.013
How is that love?

00:31:06.893 --> 00:31:07.893
Right?

00:31:14.813 --> 00:31:16.533
You think I love him,
and I don't love you.

00:31:17.773 --> 00:31:19.093
You think I'm too good to you.

00:31:20.253 --> 00:31:22.213
It's not enough to prove
how much I love you.

00:31:23.533 --> 00:31:24.533
Fine.

00:31:25.013 --> 00:31:26.413
From now on,

00:31:30.333 --> 00:31:31.333
I'll change.

00:31:39.173 --> 00:31:40.613
I'll be good to him.

00:31:43.573 --> 00:31:45.133
Let's never meet again.

00:31:47.333 --> 00:31:49.133
Let's never get in touch.

00:31:55.053 --> 00:31:56.053
Okay.

00:32:00.053 --> 00:32:01.053
Fine.

00:32:04.013 --> 00:32:10.093
(Chi Cheng)

00:32:12.333 --> 00:32:14.013
This is the evidence
I found for you.

00:32:15.333 --> 00:32:16.333
Seven years ago,

00:32:16.334 --> 00:32:17.533
Wang Shuo and Guo Cheng Yu...

00:32:18.053 --> 00:32:19.773
didn't have sex.

00:32:25.173 --> 00:32:26.173
Congratulations.

00:32:28.013 --> 00:32:29.493
Your issue is resolved.

00:32:31.213 --> 00:32:33.893
Now, you can get
back together with him.

00:32:37.133 --> 00:32:38.133
I'm so happy.

00:32:43.213 --> 00:32:45.053
I'm so happy
that I don't know what to say.

00:32:51.733 --> 00:32:52.733
Wu Suo Wei.

00:32:56.693 --> 00:32:57.693
Thank you.

00:32:59.533 --> 00:33:01.093
Thank you for being so good to me.

00:33:03.893 --> 00:33:05.333
Thank you for paving the way for us.

00:33:11.573 --> 00:33:13.253
This is the end for us.

00:33:46.493 --> 00:33:47.773
Don't you know...

00:33:49.813 --> 00:33:51.453
whether I love you or not?

00:36:27.533 --> 00:36:28.533
Chi Cheng.

00:36:31.573 --> 00:36:32.573
Why are you here?

00:36:39.293 --> 00:36:40.293
Wu Suo Wei...

00:36:42.493 --> 00:36:44.133
showed me your video back then.

00:36:47.093 --> 00:36:48.533
Even if I waited for seven years,

00:36:49.173 --> 00:36:50.493
you're finally here.

00:37:09.453 --> 00:37:11.493
Do you still remember...

00:37:13.013 --> 00:37:14.213
the pattern on his forehead...

00:37:14.653 --> 00:37:15.653
when I gave it to you?

00:37:18.733 --> 00:37:19.733
It's heart-shaped.

00:37:20.773 --> 00:37:21.773
Nice.

00:37:22.373 --> 00:37:23.373
You have a good memory.

00:37:35.173 --> 00:37:37.093
I still prefer
seeing you like this now.

00:37:38.933 --> 00:37:40.133
Why must a simple person...

00:37:40.573 --> 00:37:41.813
think too much?

00:37:42.213 --> 00:37:43.653
It's all because
I was so mad at you.

00:37:46.293 --> 00:37:47.333
From now on, be this way.

00:37:49.813 --> 00:37:50.813
Stop dwelling on things.

00:37:52.013 --> 00:37:53.413
Who's to blame for that?

00:37:54.133 --> 00:37:55.133
It's all your fault.

00:37:58.693 --> 00:38:00.293
Then from now on,

00:38:01.893 --> 00:38:02.973
don't change this attitude.

00:38:04.133 --> 00:38:05.133
What attitude?

00:38:14.533 --> 00:38:15.573
I owe you this line.

00:38:28.773 --> 00:38:29.773
Wang Shuo.

00:38:35.053 --> 00:38:36.533
I don't love you anymore.

00:38:51.013 --> 00:38:53.213
After watching
the video Wu Suo Wei sent me,

00:38:55.053 --> 00:38:56.053
I realized...

00:38:57.693 --> 00:38:59.853
I've long lost any feelings for you
in my heart.

00:39:03.813 --> 00:39:05.613
All these years,
I've been struggling...

00:39:08.293 --> 00:39:09.693
because I didn't know the answer.

00:39:12.533 --> 00:39:14.293
When Wu Suo Wei gave me the answer,

00:39:15.133 --> 00:39:16.293
I became even more certain...

00:39:16.933 --> 00:39:18.213
that I don't love you anymore.

00:39:24.893 --> 00:39:25.893
Chi Cheng.

00:39:28.973 --> 00:39:30.133
You're so cruel.

00:39:40.053 --> 00:39:41.173
Didn't you ask me before...

00:39:44.213 --> 00:39:46.573
why I only care about you
being gone for seven years,

00:39:47.853 --> 00:39:48.853
but never asked...

00:39:48.854 --> 00:39:50.533
about what you did
with Guo Cheng Yu?

00:39:56.933 --> 00:39:58.333
I'll give you an answer now.

00:40:03.413 --> 00:40:04.853
Because what really hurt me...

00:40:07.373 --> 00:40:08.532
was your decisiveness,

00:40:08.533 --> 00:40:09.893
not your betrayal.

00:40:11.333 --> 00:40:13.293
I hate you
for never explaining things to me.

00:40:16.413 --> 00:40:17.853
You were gone for seven years,

00:40:25.893 --> 00:40:27.973
and there was never
a crack in my heart.

00:40:31.453 --> 00:40:32.813
In the three years we dated...

00:40:37.853 --> 00:40:39.173
and the six years after you left,

00:40:39.493 --> 00:40:41.733
my heart was completely yours.

00:40:44.573 --> 00:40:45.893
It was you who didn't protect it.

00:40:50.053 --> 00:40:51.333
Now it's gone.

00:40:53.213 --> 00:40:55.173
It's completely Wu Suo Wei's.

00:41:04.453 --> 00:41:05.453
Stop it.

00:41:18.333 --> 00:41:19.333
Wang Shuo.

00:41:28.413 --> 00:41:29.413
I'll get going.

00:41:42.373 --> 00:41:44.293
I'm returning
Green-Eyed Monster to you.

00:41:48.013 --> 00:41:49.013
Take good care of him.

00:42:59.653 --> 00:43:01.173
- Hello?
- Hello?

00:43:01.293 --> 00:43:03.813
Hi, are you Wu Qi Qiong?

00:43:04.973 --> 00:43:05.973
Yes.

00:43:06.933 --> 00:43:08.653
Do you know Ms. Zhang Li Ya?

00:43:08.853 --> 00:43:10.773
Her emergency contact
is not answering his phone.

00:43:10.973 --> 00:43:13.613
We found your number
in her recent call history.

00:43:14.893 --> 00:43:15.893
She's my mom.

00:43:15.933 --> 00:43:16.933
What happened to her?

00:43:16.973 --> 00:43:17.973
She fainted at home.

00:43:18.013 --> 00:43:19.452
A neighbor called for an ambulance.

00:43:19.453 --> 00:43:21.212
She's at the hospital now.
She's in critical condition.

00:43:21.213 --> 00:43:22.493
You should come to the hospital.

00:43:22.573 --> 00:43:23.573
Okay.
