00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.960
(Adapted from the novel
"Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.920
(Episode 21, Father-in-Law)

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.520
Xiao Shuai,
is Young Master Guo with you?

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.520
Cheng Yu?

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.440
He's not here.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.720
He just got a call,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.200
then he left in a hurry.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.616
And he wouldn't let me go with him.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.976
I'm afraid something
would happen to him.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.240
That's why I'm calling to ask.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.760
- Why are you doing this?
- If he's not there, I'm hanging up.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.680
Chi Cheng, darn you!

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.840
Why did you deceive him?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.440
Don't you know he's been hurt?

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.480
Even if you're Chi Cheng,

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.400
you can't do that!

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.600
I deceived him. So what?

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.280
Stop it!

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.120
Xiao Shuai.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.920
Come on. Let's go home.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.360
Go home?

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.640
Which home?

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.520
Don't you know your own home?

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.720
Let's go.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.520
- Am I good or what?
- You are.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.120
Come on.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.560
Let's go home.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.560
What are you doing?

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.160
I'm thirsty.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.360
I want some water.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.600
Do you want some?

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.760
I'm fine.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.280
It's so hot today.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.240
It's hot.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.760
I'm going to take a shower.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Wait for me here.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.400
Okay?

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.880
This show's quite good.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.960
I heard there are
four new episodes today.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.560
Why don't we watch them all?

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.720
Four episodes.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.360
Do you want to finish watching them?

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.720
Why is it dark?

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:58.960
I think there's a blackout.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.920
Did you pull the power on purpose?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Don't slander me.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:05.840
I'll go out and check...

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.040
if the fuse box is broken.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.079
Don't. Don't go.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.080
I'm scared.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.360
It's okay. Don't be scared.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.000
I'll light some candles.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.360
- Wait for me.
- Okay.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.560
Come closer.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.760
So...

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.960
you're not scared now, right?

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.600
Try this.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.680
- It's good.
- Yes, it's tasty.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.760
- Are you exhausted?
- I'm okay.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.640
Did you get your fill?

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.120
Yes.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.960
I'm freaking asking you
about that stuff.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.640
That's what I'm freaking...

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:13.680
talking about.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.600
How was...

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.120
Cheng Yu?

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.800
He's probably better than Chi Cheng.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.080
No way!

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.960
Cheng Yu, how many times
a night can...

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.400
I have a secret.
Do you want to hear it?

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.560
Cheng Yu told me about it.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.560
Tell me.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.840
In order to get you fed,

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.560
I freaking didn't get my fill.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:46.920
I have pimples now.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.840
Wang Zhen and Wang Shuo
don't seem to be real brothers.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.759
Wang Shuo
isn't his mom's biological son.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.760
He was adopted.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.080
What?

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.240
It's true.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.400
Don't tell anyone.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.600
Don't worry.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.040
Keep an eye on this for me.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.640
Go. I'll keep an eye on this.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.919
Listen. Don't tell anyone
about this.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.720
Okay? Don't breathe
a word to anyone, got it?

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.160
- What's up?
- What's up?

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.320
Come on.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.800
What are you doing?

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.160
Chi Cheng, what are you doing?

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.040
Let go of me.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.520
Don't strip me.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.320
There are so many people.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Don't touch me.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.440
Awesome.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.640
Don't look.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.400
It's not suitable for children.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.480
You're so heavy.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.040
(By filial son, Wu Qi Qiong)

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.719
(Grave of loving dad and mom,
Wu Tian Xiang, Zhang Li Ya)

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.720
Mom.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.880
My company recently
got a big project.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.800
It's going to start work soon.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.600
Right now, my company...

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.200
is a bit well-known...

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.360
in the industry.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.560
Mom, Chi Cheng always says
I'm stingy.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.400
Am I stingy? I'm not.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.160
I've always remembered
what you told me.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.216
I should save what I must
and spend what I have to.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.240
I shouldn't spend on
what I don't need.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.680
Mom, I already saved up...

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.000
a lot of money.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.640
I was saving...

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.480
for my wedding before.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:58.960
Now,

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.320
I'm saving for our retirement.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.640
I've already planned
the rest of our lives.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.200
Don't worry, Mom.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.560
Dad.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.120
I found you a son-in-law.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.360
Apart from being a man,

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.640
he has no other flaws.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.280
You know what?

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.720
He never let me do the housework.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.200
And he entrusts me...

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.840
with his money.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.240
You know what?

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.400
My partner...

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.880
is so easy to coax.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.800
No matter what I do wrong,

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.400
once I smile at him,

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.480
he can't do anything to me.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.640
Dad, you haven't met
my partner, have you?

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.920
Someday, I'll burn
a couple of photos...

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.200
to show him to you.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.680
That's all I want to tell you.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.080
I'll visit you often.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.280
I'll get going, Mom and Dad.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:35.200
(Grave of loving dad and mom,
Wu Tian Xiang, Zhang Li Ya)

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.520
- Come with us.
- Wait. Who are you?

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.400
- Hurry!
- Wait.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.960
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.960
Wait. I sprained my ankle.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.840
Don't touch me.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.800
Have I been kidnapped?

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.480
Why am I tied up so humanely?

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.560
Do you know who I am?

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.720
Then tell me.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.440
Who am I?

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.320
Father...

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.600
Father-in-law.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.999
Mr. Zhao from Jia'er Culture said...

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.520
something came up
and he can't make it.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.000
That's so rude.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.040
It's okay.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.600
(Wei Wei)

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:01.760
(Wei Wei)

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.120
Where are we going later?

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.640
Let's go home.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.000
I haven't been home in a while.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.640
Dad.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.520
I'm home.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.160
Don't speak. Hush.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.440
Where's my mom?

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.960
Your mom went to your sister.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:54.880
My sister's coming back?

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.040
Why didn't you tell me?

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.439
You don't come home
for three to five months.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.400
Is there a difference
if we tell you or not?

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.640
Chi Cheng.

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.320
Are you hiding someone?

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.880
A few days ago,
your uncle sent a puppy.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.160
I'm keeping him in that room.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.200
These are organic vegetables
from our garden.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.760
Try her cooking.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.480
Are you free tomorrow?

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.320
What do you want me to do?

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.440
Go on a blind date with me.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.400
You're already so old.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.160
You still want to get a new wife?

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:14.960
Does my mom know?

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:17.600
What are you talking about?

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.160
It's a blind date for you.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.320
Why are you going on my blind date?

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.600
I'm afraid you'll scare
the young lady away.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.720
I'm already scary enough.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.200
Wouldn't it be scarier
if you went too?

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.720
Based on what you're saying,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.240
you're planning to go tomorrow?

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.040
No.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.536
No? Then why are you wasting time
talking nonsense with me?

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.520
Since you're talking to me,
I'm responding to you.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.200
I can't ignore you, can I?

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.680
Chi Cheng!

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
He's so noisy.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.240
Based on the sound,

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.320
I think he broke your antique vase.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.520
Why didn't you tie him?

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.080
It's a hassle
even when he's tied up.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.199
The room is not that big.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.840
He can reach things
wherever he's tied up.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.280
The apple doesn't fall far
from the tree.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.559
It turns out that Chi Cheng's habit
of running his mouth...

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.320
is from his dad.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.280
Let him out then.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.480
Don't open the door.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.520
That dog bites strangers.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.879
A few days ago, your uncle came
and got bitten.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.160
He just got his third injection.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.040
What breed is it?

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.680
It's a crossbreed.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
A crossbreed?

00:19:45.001 --> 00:19:46.841
Kill him. What's the point
of keeping him then?

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.320
Are you going
on the blind date tomorrow or not?

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:02.840
I'm not going.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.640
If you're not going, get lost.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:52.800
Sit up and eat something.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.279
It used to be Chi Cheng...

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.760
who ate my leftovers.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.680
Now, it's finally
the other way around.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.399
Hello, Xiao Lin.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.960
- Mr. Chi.
- Have you seen Mr. Wu?

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.440
Mr. Wu?

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.680
No.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.160
I haven't seen him all day.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.480
I see.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.120
Did you find him?

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.840
Has Wu Suo Wei offended
anyone lately?

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.360
Who can he offend?

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.920
Even if he did,

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.920
in this area,

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.816
there are only
a handful of people...

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:12.960
who would dare to touch him.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Chi Cheng.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.360
Could it be your dad?

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.440
Are you hiding someone?

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.040
A few days ago,
your uncle sent a puppy.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.280
I'm keeping him in that room.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.640
Don't open the door.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.440
That dog bites strangers.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.640
A few days ago, your uncle came
and got bitten.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.120
He just had his third injection.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.880
How did his dad know about them?

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:41.920
You little fool.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.960
His dad has spies all over the city.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.920
The two of them
eat and live together.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.440
On top of that, he did this before.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.200
Do you think his dad doesn't know?

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.120
Even if his dad knows,

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.480
he can just call him over...

00:22:56.481 --> 00:22:57.800
and teach him a lesson.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.880
Use your little brain.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.240
What kind of person is his dad?

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:04.720
Think about it.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.560
Can an ordinary person...

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.360
have a son like him?

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:12.840
At a time like this,

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:14.640
stop joking around with me.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.600
Pause it.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.640
Zoom in.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.400
(July 10th, 2024, Wednesday)

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.840
(July 10th, 2024, Wednesday)

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Keep an eye on it for me.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.360
- Thank you.
- Okay.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.960
If I don't know him well enough,

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.560
I'd think I was wrong about him.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:16.520
Young Master Chi.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.600
The chairman is meeting
with an important client.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:19.920
If it's urgent, you can tell me.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.120
I'll pass it on for you.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:22.840
Okay.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:25.120
Tell him...

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.760
to take care of himself.

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.040
Wei Wei!

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:37.520
Wei Wei!

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Wei Wei!

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:47.960
Wei Wei!

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:03.360
Hello, Young Master Chi.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:04.600
Wait.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:10.680
Who did you bring food to?

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.400
I brought it to Mr. Chi.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.120
My dad never eats late-night snacks.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.560
My sister and mom
aren't home either.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.080
Ms. Wang.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.120
Tell me the truth.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.280
Who did you bring it to?

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.160
During the day,
Mr. Chi kidnapped a young man.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.919
I brought it to him.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.000
What kind of young man?

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:40.920
Where is he?

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.320
He's tall and thin,

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.480
with big eyes.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.720
He's at an abandoned factory
in the suburbs.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.200
Don't tell him I told you!

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.400
What did he say?

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.600
He... told you
to take care of yourself.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:58.920
Scoundrel!

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.160
Also,

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.359
Ms. Wang got caught
when she delivered the food.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.800
Young Master Chi is on his way.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.000
Should we move to another location?

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:07.800
Don't mind him.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.000
I've instructed Ms. Wang in advance.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.160
He can't find this place.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.080
- Hey, Gang Zi.
- Hello, Young Master Chi.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.120
I'm going to the factory
in the suburbs now.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:23.936
If you catch the three of them,
bring them to me.

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.600
- Okay. No problem.
- All right.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.440
Wei Wei!

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.240
Wei Wei!

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.120
Wei Wei!

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:49.280
Wei Wei!

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.560
Wei Wei!

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.360
Darn it.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.400
Wei Wei!

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.640
Does it hurt?

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.840
It's okay.

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.400
Except for his ankle
and the pulled ligament,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.496
the rest are just
superficial injuries.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:15.640
He'll be fine in a few days.

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.800
Thank you, doctor.

00:27:16.801 --> 00:27:18.360
Thank you for coming at this hour.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.840
You're too kind.
It's what I should do, it's my job.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.600
- This way, please.
- See the doctor out.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:23.800
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.560
Mr. Chi.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.240
Please let me go.

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.719
Recently, my company
got a big project.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.760
They can't do it without me.

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.120
Isn't Chi Cheng managing
the company for you?

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.040
You can take this opportunity...

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.400
to rest for a couple of days.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Still...

00:27:48.001 --> 00:27:50.040
Still, you can't tire out your son.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.120
Do you not tire him out?

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Chi Cheng's mom...

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.360
went abroad to visit
Chi Cheng's sister.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.080
I'm the only one home.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.320
Be my companion.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.400
I'll keep you company?

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.480
What? You don't want to?

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:15.720
No.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.040
I...

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:19.520
am...

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.720
flattered.

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.080
Let's go. Hurry up!

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.640
You were so arrogant just now.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.720
Be quick!

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.480
Hurry up!

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.040
Get up!

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.040
Squat down.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.040
Squat properly!

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:37.560
Don't move!

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:39.840
We found them.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.040
Where's my guy?

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.160
He's asking you.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.240
We... don't know.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.360
After we kidnapped him,

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.240
Mr. Chi won't let us
get involved anymore.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.200
You're all darn useless.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.440
Get up!

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:05.720
What should we do with them?

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.360
Send them...

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.600
to whoever hired them.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:10.600
All right.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:11.600
Let's go! Don't move!

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.280
Don't freaking move!

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.200
Are you crazy?

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.080
You're sending them back?

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.640
What?

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.920
Do you want to infuriate
your old man to death?

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.440
I think...

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.039
you don't want to go
against him head-on, do you?

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.080
Even when a rabbit is cornered,
he'll freaking bite.

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.280
I think you don't have
a brain at all.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000
If you go back now,

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.240
you'll be walking into a trap.

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.240
Besides, your darling...

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.040
is still with your dad.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.240
Don't get yourself trapped too.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.680
Have a smoke.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:52.880
I'm not in the mood.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.040
Come on. Let's go to my place.

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:57.840
What are you looking at?
Stop looking!

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.360
Squat properly. Squat down.

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.600
Chi Cheng must be looking
for me everywhere.

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.920
Chi Cheng's facial features
are like his dad's.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.160
But his dad is gentler than him.

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.560
Do you sleep with the lights on?

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.160
What are you doing?

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.680
Put me out of my misery.

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.016
Since you won't put me out
of my misery,

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.600
why should I put you out
of your misery?

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.880
Mr. Chi.

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.080
Can I ask you something?

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Go ahead.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Mr. Chi.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.680
Since you're locking me up here,

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.000
why aren't you torturing me?

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.960
When I know you well enough,

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.360
I'll torture you then.

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:51.160
I already know...

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.400
about your family.

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:54.800
Your parents...

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:56.800
are both upright people.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.080
You have a good character too.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.880
You're a quite honest young man.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.960
Why are you hanging out
with Chi Cheng?

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.520
He's not a good guy.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.480
If you're together,
it won't end well.

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.200
How can you say that about your son?

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.680
Don't think I'm joking with you.

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.880
I know my son best.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.960
You're not the first person
he's dated.

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.080
He's a habitual offender.

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.480
You're a first-time offender.

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.280
There's no hope
for repeat offenders.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.200
First-time offenders...

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.200
still have a chance
to turn over a new leaf.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.880
So what you just said is wrong.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.040
I'm not torturing you.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.000
I'm saving you.

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:46.320
Thank you, Mr. Chi.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.320
After eating, come home with me.

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:53.920
What for?

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:08.840
I made such a commotion yesterday.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.400
Chi Cheng must have
found out later on.

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.000
He looked around the house,

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.120
but he couldn't find me.

00:33:15.121 --> 00:33:17.680
He must have thought his dad
sent me somewhere else.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.720
I didn't expect
that after all the twists and turns,

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.680
I'd be sent back here again.

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:40.760
When Chi Cheng was little,

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.840
this little wastrel...

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:49.280
was quite cute.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.640
A DV.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.240
It's still working.

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.000
Let's see what we have.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:26.879
Look at this kid.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.440
Are you enjoying your stay here?

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:32.600
Isn't this broken?

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:34.760
I'll take it and throw it away.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.040
Don't throw it away.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.119
I... Look, I just fixed it.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.200
This can still be used too.

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:42.760
At worst,

00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:44.640
sell it as junk...

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.360
for a few dozen yuan.

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:48.600
What a cheapskate.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:49.880
Enjoy yourself.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.840
I'm so bored.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.360
It's so boring.

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.520
I'm so bored.

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.800
Wu Suo Wei, where are you?

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.400
Five.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.040
Two.

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:43.760
Zero.

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:52.560
Five, twenty.

00:35:58.720 --> 00:35:59.720
I love you more.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:05.720
Wait.

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.400
If I can use my watch
to express my love,

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.400
can I also send
a hidden signal with my watch?

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.200
Let me think.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.120
Nine, five?

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.200
Help me.

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.240
Nine, five.

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.080
Five.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:44.800
Five.

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.040
I am in...

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.360
At...

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.120
What number should I use for that?

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.560
That's not right.

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:52.680
No.

00:36:52.681 --> 00:36:54.000
- Eight.
- Eight.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.280
- Eight.
- Eight.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.680
- Eight.
- Eight.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:06.600
I'm doomed.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.599
I can't make the sound
of that word using numbers.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.240
How else can I use numbers
to point to a location?

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:16.680
This is...

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.119
Liangxi Street.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.240
Block 520,

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.360
No. 8.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.200
5208.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:25.960
Five.

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.320
- Two.
- Two.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Zero.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Eight.

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:46.640
What does that mean?

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:54.880
Doesn't he get it?

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:56.840
I'll do it again.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:05.800
What are you doing?

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.360
Nothing.

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.440
I'm just bored.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:11.560
Come out for a chat.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:13.880
Come on.

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.520
This...

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:23.600
(Molten Lava)

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.360
looks like my recipe.

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.160
Don't worry about the recipe.

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.160
I'll give you a new one.

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:31.520
This is serious.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.240
I've tried my best.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.680
I really can't tell what it is.

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:43.680
I think...

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:44.800
sometimes,

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.040
having a high IQ...

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:48.440
can't be as good
as really knowing the person.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:50.800
Jiang Xiao Shuai.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.840
Five, eight, eight, eight.

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.000
Five, eight, eight,

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:57.840
eight.

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:00.920
Eight...

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:03.760
I'm rich.

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:07.120
Did your dad give him
a lot of money?

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.640
Five-twenty is easy to understand.

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.520
It's "I love you."

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:12.680
I love you too.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:19.600
- Go on.
- I get it now.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.560
"I love you. Bye."

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:25.440
So if you connect them,

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.320
your dad gave him a lot of money...

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.440
and treats him well.

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:29.480
You don't have to worry.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:30.960
Bye.

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.280
Awesome.

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:39.600
I'd better go home tomorrow.
