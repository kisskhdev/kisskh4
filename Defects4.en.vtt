00:00:26.268 --> 00:00:27.102
Yes.

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:29.538
Here.

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:38.180
Are we living here now?

You've been through a lot.

00:00:58.466 --> 00:00:59.501
Not at all.

00:01:00.368 --> 00:01:03.305
You had it tough supporting my business.

Nothing. It's a good day today,

00:02:02.764 --> 00:02:04.266
so I wanted to have a drink with you.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.934
Really?

00:02:07.135 --> 00:02:09.437

This is nice.

What?

00:04:15.063 --> 00:04:16.765
You told me to do everything I want.

00:04:18.867 --> 00:04:21.203
I thought you were smart,
but wouldn't make money.

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:26.842
But it turns out you're quite useful.

Yes, it's good.

It's a chance
that only comes once every ten months.

00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:28.069
Imagine how fierce
the competition must be.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.905
Even though it's not custom-made,

00:05:29.905 --> 00:05:32.307
why do customers get so obsessed
with auctions?

00:05:32.307 --> 00:05:35.010
People aren't confident
in their own choices.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.945
They think something's only good
if others say so.

Assemblyman Kwon is not inside.

00:05:53.662 --> 00:05:56.264
I checked all the cars in the building.

00:05:56.264 --> 00:05:57.199
I just have something quick to ask.

00:05:57.632 --> 00:05:59.734
You should've made an appointment.

Even if you're the police,
you can't barge in like this.

It'll just take a minute.

00:06:05.507 --> 00:06:07.409
This is obstruction of official duty.

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:10.445
He's inside.

00:06:10.445 --> 00:06:11.713

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.415
No, you can't go inside.

No.

Then I'll be seeing you soon.

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:22.557
Yes.

Please have a seat.

00:06:45.147 --> 00:06:47.549
I mean Kwon Sung Woo

00:07:28.089 --> 00:07:32.060
Detective Choi Hyeong Seok, was it?

00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:33.528
Yes.

Please leave.

Yes, I'm fine.

00:08:44.866 --> 00:08:45.800
Let's go inside.

00:08:54.276 --> 00:08:56.244
Okay, let's summarize things.

00:08:57.612 --> 00:08:58.914
This is Uncle Tae Sik.

00:09:00.148 --> 00:09:01.316
Tae Sik was...

00:09:01.917 --> 00:09:03.051
subcontracted by this person...

00:09:03.051 --> 00:09:05.887
to secretly dispose of abandoned children.

00:09:05.887 --> 00:09:07.455
But he saved us instead.

00:09:08.557 --> 00:09:11.226
There's definitely someone above him.

00:09:11.226 --> 00:09:12.194
And I think...

00:09:13.295 --> 00:09:14.496
it's this person.

00:09:17.666 --> 00:09:20.202
And this person
doesn't just handle abandonment.

00:09:21.236 --> 00:09:22.904
They were arranging illegal adoptions...

00:09:23.138 --> 00:09:24.739
for wealthy clients.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.708
And those adoptions weren't...

00:09:26.708 --> 00:09:28.710
about finding kids.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:33.415
Using these sperms...

00:09:34.649 --> 00:09:36.685
and these eggs, they created babies.

00:09:37.552 --> 00:09:38.353
Right.

00:09:39.054 --> 00:09:40.455
They said the biological fathers
and mothers were...

00:09:40.856 --> 00:09:42.691
both unaware the babies existed.

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:48.830
So this woman donated her egg,

00:09:51.366 --> 00:09:53.401
but she knows nothing about the reason.

00:09:53.969 --> 00:09:54.870
Exactly.

00:09:56.271 --> 00:09:57.472
This is completely illegal.

00:09:58.373 --> 00:10:01.676
There was nothing legal from the start.

00:10:04.012 --> 00:10:04.913
Then...

00:10:05.881 --> 00:10:06.982

00:10:11.586 --> 00:10:12.787
I read about it in a book.

00:10:13.989 --> 00:10:15.991
The Nazis used to do that...

00:10:17.125 --> 00:10:18.827
to create perfect genes.

00:10:20.929 --> 00:10:22.464
Perfect genes.

00:10:26.434 --> 00:10:27.202
Ah Hyun.

00:10:28.103 --> 00:10:30.105
I need a perfect daughter.

00:10:31.473 --> 00:10:33.108
This is so disgusting.

00:10:33.775 --> 00:10:34.843
Mom said...

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.978
they're far more monstrous...

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.448
than we imagine.

00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:41.850
Let's find them.

00:10:43.985 --> 00:10:45.053
We have to stop this.

Ah Hyun.

00:10:51.126 --> 00:10:53.361
Let's find them.

00:10:54.229 --> 00:10:55.463
Play the video we filmed.

00:10:55.997 --> 00:10:56.932
Okay.

00:11:05.941 --> 00:11:07.476
She definitely looks like the final boss.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:09.778
Something's up.

00:11:10.779 --> 00:11:13.381
But how do we find this woman?

00:11:16.318 --> 00:11:17.285
Then first,

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:20.155
let's find the egg donor.

00:11:20.922 --> 00:11:21.723
Okay.

(Science for a healthy tomorrow,

00:11:50.685 --> 00:11:52.354
She comes to this nightclub
every day except Sunday.

00:11:52.354 --> 00:11:53.989
She says she studies on Sundays.

00:11:53.989 --> 00:11:55.524
You know what's really scary?

00:11:55.857 --> 00:11:57.359
She plays like that and studies for a day,

00:11:57.359 --> 00:11:58.793
and she's a pre-med ace.

00:11:58.793 --> 00:12:00.028
They say she's like an AI.

00:12:00.028 --> 00:12:02.264
She memorizes whole textbooks.

00:12:02.264 --> 00:12:03.532
Is she on drugs or something?

00:12:07.736 --> 00:12:08.670
Got a light?

00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:15.577
Don't know me?
I'm a second-year med student.

00:12:15.577 --> 00:12:17.546
What brings a med student
to a place like this?

00:12:17.546 --> 00:12:18.313
Do you want to hang out?

00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:22.184
I'm kind of busy.

00:13:13.602 --> 00:13:14.536
It's them.

00:13:16.538 --> 00:13:17.706
They're headed to that place.

00:13:46.968 --> 00:13:47.769
What can I get you?

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:49.171
Beer?

00:13:56.211 --> 00:13:57.179
You know this, right?

00:13:57.479 --> 00:13:59.581
Find the server room and plug it in.

00:14:00.315 --> 00:14:02.117
Then all the data they're using will...

00:14:02.117 --> 00:14:03.919
be sent to me in real-time.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.655
And this.

00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:08.190
Don't use it unless you have to.

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:09.658
It's too dangerous.

00:14:13.662 --> 00:14:14.529
Be careful.

00:14:15.831 --> 00:14:16.965
Don't worry.

00:14:16.965 --> 00:14:19.267
Don't get hurt, Ah Hyun.

00:14:21.336 --> 00:14:22.571
Take care of the others.

00:14:23.038 --> 00:14:24.172

Three are scheduled this week.

00:15:16.558 --> 00:15:17.926
All of them are quite usable.

00:15:20.295 --> 00:15:21.730
Usable is not enough.

00:15:22.531 --> 00:15:24.432
I told you I want perfection.

00:15:28.236 --> 00:15:30.839
When can I expect that special one?

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.942
I won't feel at ease
unless it's that level.

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:49.891
Get in.

00:17:36.064 --> 00:17:36.898
Yes.

00:17:47.175 --> 00:17:48.376
Please change into that.

00:17:49.578 --> 00:17:50.479
Okay.

00:17:50.479 --> 00:17:51.513
Knock when you're done changing.

00:18:14.669 --> 00:18:15.604
Just a second.

00:18:19.574 --> 00:18:21.843
How exactly are you handling
this situation?

00:18:21.843 --> 00:18:23.445
Some detective came by and...

00:18:23.445 --> 00:18:26.381
You cannot collect spilled milk.

00:18:27.215 --> 00:18:29.284
So we'll just have to mop it well.

00:18:29.284 --> 00:18:30.752
What do you mean by that?

00:18:30.986 --> 00:18:33.622
Do you mean he's alive? Is that it?

00:18:34.122 --> 00:18:35.123
Apparently,

00:18:36.858 --> 00:18:38.760
they say Kwon Sung Woo is alive.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:39.861
What?

00:18:39.861 --> 00:18:42.898
How could you handle this so carelessly!

Assemblyman Kwon.

00:18:49.704 --> 00:18:51.540
You said you'd take care of it quietly,

00:18:51.973 --> 00:18:53.875
neatly, without anyone knowing!

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:57.679
If people find out your son is alive,

00:18:58.814 --> 00:19:00.949
it will turn Korea upside down, won't it?

00:19:02.384 --> 00:19:03.485
What on earth are you...

00:19:03.985 --> 00:19:04.986
Do you think this is unfair?

00:19:05.153 --> 00:19:06.621
If you do, go ahead and sue me.

00:19:12.294 --> 00:19:14.062
Are you messing with me right now?

00:19:15.831 --> 00:19:17.098
Is it because you need money?

00:19:18.166 --> 00:19:19.234
Assemblyman Kwon.

00:19:20.168 --> 00:19:22.871
I've already earned more money
than I could ever use.

00:19:23.939 --> 00:19:26.007
Making money isn't fun anymore.

00:19:28.643 --> 00:19:29.878
I just want...

00:19:30.879 --> 00:19:32.647
to set this abnormal world...

00:19:33.915 --> 00:19:35.951
right again.

00:19:36.785 --> 00:19:37.819
What?

00:19:39.421 --> 00:19:41.056
And it was good.

00:19:42.491 --> 00:19:45.160
God saw all that he had made,
and it was very good.

00:19:46.695 --> 00:19:48.630
Whenever I read that verse, I wonder.

00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:52.834
Was it really?

00:19:53.969 --> 00:19:55.670
Was He really satisfied...

00:19:56.938 --> 00:19:58.507
after creating men?

00:20:00.642 --> 00:20:01.610
No.

00:20:02.344 --> 00:20:04.045
I don't think so.

00:20:05.614 --> 00:20:07.382
He must've handed down all those trials...

00:20:07.382 --> 00:20:09.751
because He wasn't happy with what He made.

00:20:11.353 --> 00:20:12.787
People who are dumb,

00:20:13.221 --> 00:20:14.789
foolish, ugly,

00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:17.893
and utterly useless to the world.
He made those people...

00:20:19.661 --> 00:20:20.795
and then carelessly said,

00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:23.431
"It was good."

00:20:27.035 --> 00:20:28.336
Isn't that too cruel?

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:30.872
But I'm a responsible person.

00:20:30.872 --> 00:20:31.840
Amen.

00:20:34.509 --> 00:20:36.645
Once I start something,
I see it through to the end.

00:20:37.379 --> 00:20:40.215
Please propose just one quick
legal amendment.

00:20:41.082 --> 00:20:43.485
Let's fix a few lines
in the Bioethics Law.

00:20:44.019 --> 00:20:45.420
Seriously?

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.521
Kwon Sung Woo.

00:20:50.692 --> 00:20:52.227
He's not only alive.

00:20:53.195 --> 00:20:54.162
What?

00:20:55.864 --> 00:20:57.465
Assemblyman Kwon.

00:20:58.333 --> 00:21:00.435
He'll kill you.

00:21:00.836 --> 00:21:03.271
I'll take care of Kwon Sung Woo.

00:21:03.271 --> 00:21:05.073
I'll take full responsibility
and make it certain.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.908
So...

00:21:07.742 --> 00:21:09.144
Assemblyman, just do your job.

00:21:09.144 --> 00:21:10.779
Take full responsibility
and make it certain.

00:22:06.501 --> 00:22:07.669
Are you okay?

00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:09.037
Yes, I'm okay.

00:22:09.037 --> 00:22:10.872
Check if there's another space.

00:22:11.139 --> 00:22:12.040
Got it.

00:22:22.417 --> 00:22:23.518
What is all that?

00:22:58.954 --> 00:22:59.855
Uncle.

00:23:00.956 --> 00:23:01.857
Ah Hyun.

00:23:02.757 --> 00:23:04.159
Change your clothes and wait.

00:23:04.826 --> 00:23:05.994
A staff member will guide you.

00:23:06.828 --> 00:23:08.563
What kind of test am I getting today?

00:23:09.798 --> 00:23:10.799
I'm not sure.

00:23:11.399 --> 00:23:13.268
Uncle, did you eat?

00:23:15.237 --> 00:23:16.438
You didn't, did you?

00:23:17.772 --> 00:23:19.107
You should eat, Uncle.

00:23:30.185 --> 00:23:32.087
I haven't restored everything
completely yet.

00:23:33.088 --> 00:23:36.224
But is this guy really a human trafficker?

00:23:36.625 --> 00:23:37.392
What?

00:23:37.659 --> 00:23:38.627
Take a look at this.

00:23:40.128 --> 00:23:42.097
"Tae Sik, we're about
to have dinner soon."

00:23:42.097 --> 00:23:43.431
"When are you coming home?"

00:23:43.431 --> 00:23:45.267
"I might be late. Don't wait up."

00:23:45.534 --> 00:23:48.170
"It's the first time
you haven't come back for this long."

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.271
"I'm worried."

00:23:49.271 --> 00:23:51.306
"Ah Hyun, I'm sorry.
I'll come home tomorrow for sure."

00:23:51.306 --> 00:23:52.674
"Don't worry. I'm safe."

00:23:53.575 --> 00:23:56.077
They're totally a family.

00:24:03.585 --> 00:24:06.054
Anesthesia complete. Prepare now.

00:24:06.054 --> 00:24:06.855
Yes.

00:24:07.122 --> 00:24:09.024
Let's get as many as we can today.

00:24:11.059 --> 00:24:13.528
Hey, let's stop having this woman now.

00:24:13.795 --> 00:24:16.398
She's had too many drugs
and she's in bad shape.

00:24:16.398 --> 00:24:17.399
They're falling apart.

00:24:18.834 --> 00:24:20.001
Understood.

00:24:20.268 --> 00:24:21.703
It's coming out smoothly.

00:24:25.073 --> 00:24:27.242
We're one person short here.

00:24:28.176 --> 00:24:29.311
Go find her.

00:24:33.982 --> 00:24:36.051
Excuse me, are you inside?

00:24:38.286 --> 00:24:39.221
Doctor.

00:24:40.088 --> 00:24:41.523
Doctor, are you okay?

00:24:43.091 --> 00:24:45.427
One of the samples is missing.

00:24:45.827 --> 00:24:47.262
Damn it.

00:25:16.057 --> 00:25:16.758
Ju An.

00:25:19.194 --> 00:25:20.795
I found the blueprint.

00:25:21.663 --> 00:25:24.099
Head down and go right.

00:25:24.099 --> 00:25:25.567
You'll find the main server room there.

00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:28.937
It looks like the main server is
the most important part.

00:25:38.547 --> 00:25:39.848
(Staff Only,
Server Room)

00:26:01.636 --> 00:26:02.504
Ju An.

00:26:04.206 --> 00:26:05.240
Do you know what this is?

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.209
Yes, go a bit more that way.

00:26:09.144 --> 00:26:10.645
Not that one,

00:26:10.645 --> 00:26:11.580
the second one.

00:26:12.981 --> 00:26:13.915
Did you find it?

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:15.984
This one?

00:26:16.718 --> 00:26:17.619
Yes, that one.

00:26:57.392 --> 00:26:58.260
Is it done?

00:27:00.795 --> 00:27:01.796
Okay.

00:27:02.797 --> 00:27:03.732
Hold on.

00:27:05.467 --> 00:27:07.936
Director Jung,
you need to come see this right now.

00:27:16.812 --> 00:27:17.879
Did you get anything?

00:27:18.113 --> 00:27:19.781
Yes.

00:27:20.348 --> 00:27:22.117
I found the buyers' list.

00:27:22.651 --> 00:27:24.186
There are thousands of names.

00:27:24.753 --> 00:27:26.154
That many?

00:27:26.154 --> 00:27:27.656
Is there anything on the sellers?

00:27:28.657 --> 00:27:29.591
Hold on.

00:27:31.626 --> 00:27:33.962
(Buyer No. 17
of Genetically Modified Child)

00:27:34.329 --> 00:27:35.597
DNA data?

00:27:36.498 --> 00:27:37.699
What's this?

00:27:37.699 --> 00:27:40.101
DNA data? What's that?

00:27:40.101 --> 00:27:40.936
What?

00:27:41.203 --> 00:27:41.937
What is that?

00:27:41.937 --> 00:27:44.539
To put it simply,

00:27:45.407 --> 00:27:48.977
they're sorting out good DNA from bad DNA,

00:27:48.977 --> 00:27:50.445
and from that,

00:27:50.445 --> 00:27:52.514
they're creating children
however they want.

00:27:56.952 --> 00:27:57.919
That's insane.

00:28:06.528 --> 00:28:07.762
What is it?

00:28:07.762 --> 00:28:09.564
We detected an external signal
so we searched.

00:28:23.712 --> 00:28:25.380
Lock down the entire building.

00:28:27.149 --> 00:28:28.150
Immediately!

00:28:40.996 --> 00:28:44.966
Code Black. Intruder alert.

00:28:44.966 --> 00:28:47.068
- We need to hurry.
- Code Black. Intruder alert.

00:28:47.068 --> 00:28:48.403
Search everywhere!

00:29:31.179 --> 00:29:33.181
We have an intruder.

00:29:40.655 --> 00:29:41.723
Sister.

00:29:42.491 --> 00:29:43.825
How have you been?

00:29:43.825 --> 00:29:44.726
Very well.

00:29:45.393 --> 00:29:47.195
Sorry for asking you
to come all the way here.

00:29:48.396 --> 00:29:49.531
I'll guide her in.

00:29:49.898 --> 00:29:50.832
Yes, ma'am.

00:29:52.834 --> 00:29:55.937
My husband can't show himself too much.

00:29:55.937 --> 00:29:57.839
So I hope you'll understand, Sister.

00:29:57.839 --> 00:29:59.674
Don't mention it.

00:30:00.142 --> 00:30:02.644
When else would I ever get the chance
to visit a place like this?

00:30:03.545 --> 00:30:06.148
Thank you for thinking that way.

00:30:11.186 --> 00:30:12.354
And, Sister.

00:30:13.555 --> 00:30:14.523
Thank you.

00:30:16.458 --> 00:30:18.093
For giving us your daughter.

00:30:19.461 --> 00:30:22.931
It really feels
like we've become a true family.

00:30:24.733 --> 00:30:26.334
Like real sisters.

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:39.614
Honey.

00:30:41.082 --> 00:30:41.983
Yes?

00:30:45.053 --> 00:30:46.121
We finally meet.

00:30:47.155 --> 00:30:48.256
I've wanted to see you.

00:30:49.257 --> 00:30:52.027
It's a pleasure. I'm Kim Se Hee.

00:30:59.367 --> 00:31:00.836
Let's get to the point.

00:31:01.603 --> 00:31:02.938
Approval ratings.

00:31:03.371 --> 00:31:06.441
As you can see, I'm holding mine steady.

00:31:07.008 --> 00:31:08.009
But...

00:31:08.009 --> 00:31:12.180
everyone who comes to me with offers...

00:31:13.215 --> 00:31:14.616
only talks about approval ratings.

00:31:15.517 --> 00:31:16.985
It gets tedious.

00:31:19.254 --> 00:31:21.089
Foolish people,

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:23.892
when they hear
what they really need to hear,

00:31:23.892 --> 00:31:25.293
they get bored.

00:31:29.998 --> 00:31:32.300
Just as I've heard,
you're bold as ever, Doctor.

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:36.605
The youngest-ever president of Korea.

00:31:37.272 --> 00:31:39.140
Record-high average approval rating.

00:31:39.875 --> 00:31:42.177
Someone with nothing to regret.

00:31:42.177 --> 00:31:44.312
Why does he care
about petty people pitching deals...

00:31:44.312 --> 00:31:46.248
based on approval ratings?

00:31:48.116 --> 00:31:51.052
Because you want to do real politics.
I know that.

00:31:53.488 --> 00:31:54.856
The low birthrate crisis.

00:31:56.992 --> 00:32:00.462
Even in a country where the president
and First Lady are DINK couples,

00:32:00.929 --> 00:32:03.165
why do they expect only me
to have a child?

00:32:03.165 --> 00:32:05.834
This isn't about approval ratings.

00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:08.904
You already know that, Mr. President.

00:32:08.904 --> 00:32:10.672
That's why you wanted to meet me.

00:32:12.073 --> 00:32:13.508
To show the people
you'll share their worries.

00:32:13.508 --> 00:32:15.210
To become one with them.

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:17.245
That's what you believe, right?

00:32:19.381 --> 00:32:20.382
And above all,

00:32:21.016 --> 00:32:23.318
you truly love your wife.

00:32:33.695 --> 00:32:37.232
I do have an eye for people.

00:32:40.202 --> 00:32:42.103
After I was diagnosed
with primary ovarian insufficiency,

00:32:43.538 --> 00:32:44.539
I thought...

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.842
about divorce.

00:32:48.109 --> 00:32:50.078
I worried I'd ruin his future...

00:32:52.948 --> 00:32:54.749
if we divorced
while he was still in office.

00:32:56.952 --> 00:32:59.855
So I even thought
about doing it before the inauguration.

00:33:00.288 --> 00:33:01.189
I will help...

00:33:01.957 --> 00:33:04.059
make your dreams come true.

00:33:06.228 --> 00:33:08.129
The Lord will bless you too.

00:33:08.797 --> 00:33:09.664
Amen.

00:33:19.407 --> 00:33:21.843
If this all wraps up well,

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:25.347
I'm thinking of bestowing
a small grace myself.

00:33:26.481 --> 00:33:29.084
I've heard your research is facing
many challenges.

00:33:29.851 --> 00:33:32.721
There are way too many
unnecessary regulations...

00:33:33.155 --> 00:33:34.289
in Korea, right?

00:33:45.867 --> 00:33:46.801
Ju An.

00:33:48.036 --> 00:33:49.171
Ju An.

00:33:49.171 --> 00:33:50.372
Just keep going straight.

00:33:53.809 --> 00:33:55.577
Please explain the exam to her.

00:33:56.178 --> 00:33:57.145
Okay.

00:34:26.274 --> 00:34:27.209
Excuse me.

00:34:28.143 --> 00:34:29.177
Miss.

00:34:30.512 --> 00:34:32.314
Where do I get my exam?

00:34:35.317 --> 00:34:37.419
I'll just wait here.

00:34:56.671 --> 00:34:58.006
What's happening? Ah Hyun.

00:35:01.576 --> 00:35:02.511
Ah Hyun!

00:35:02.711 --> 00:35:04.513
What is it? What's wrong?

00:35:08.283 --> 00:35:10.085
Ah Hyun, do you need something?

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:12.721
May I go in?

00:35:20.328 --> 00:35:21.029
Yes.

00:35:23.965 --> 00:35:25.433
Who was that lady earlier?

00:35:25.901 --> 00:35:27.302
Is this her first time here?

00:35:27.302 --> 00:35:28.303
Who?

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:56.898
Snow White.

00:35:59.935 --> 00:36:01.937
Do you know the true story of Snow White?

00:36:06.208 --> 00:36:08.844
Why?
Is it your first time seeing me smoke?

00:36:11.112 --> 00:36:11.913
Yes.

00:36:15.951 --> 00:36:17.018
Do you want to try?

00:36:18.453 --> 00:36:19.621
Mom.

00:36:20.789 --> 00:36:21.857
Ah Hyun.

00:36:23.959 --> 00:36:28.597
You know the stepmother
from Snow White who says "Mirror, mirror?"

00:36:30.866 --> 00:36:32.367
That woman is actually...

00:36:42.444 --> 00:36:43.812
(Signal lost)

00:36:44.012 --> 00:36:45.447
This is driving me crazy.

00:36:46.681 --> 00:36:48.216
They cut off everything from there.

00:36:48.216 --> 00:36:49.084
What?

00:36:49.818 --> 00:36:50.819
Let's go, quick.

00:36:51.353 --> 00:36:52.220
Seok Su.

00:36:52.954 --> 00:36:54.055
We have to go.

00:37:00.462 --> 00:37:01.329
Ju An.

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:03.465
Ju An.

00:37:03.999 --> 00:37:07.002
(No signal)

00:37:10.906 --> 00:37:12.174
There! Get her!

00:37:13.175 --> 00:37:14.810
Intruder spotted.

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:19.147
Seok Su.

00:37:19.147 --> 00:37:20.148
We have to go.

00:37:20.515 --> 00:37:23.285
We have to do something.

00:37:23.752 --> 00:37:25.453
But what are we even going to do?

00:37:26.154 --> 00:37:27.155
Ah Hyun.

00:37:36.231 --> 00:37:37.098
Hey!

00:37:39.301 --> 00:37:40.235
Ah Hyun.

00:37:42.304 --> 00:37:43.171
Ah Hyun.

00:37:45.607 --> 00:37:46.641
Ah Hyun.

00:37:46.975 --> 00:37:47.742
Si Woo.

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:49.845
What are you saying?

00:37:51.947 --> 00:37:53.114
It was Ah Hyun.

00:37:55.116 --> 00:37:57.619
The person
who was in front of Ah Hyun was...

00:38:01.323 --> 00:38:02.424
Ah Hyun.

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:13.268
Over there.

00:38:13.735 --> 00:38:14.669
Catch her!

00:38:20.208 --> 00:38:20.976
Damn it.

00:38:24.746 --> 00:38:25.981

You report to higher-ups.

00:38:56.578 --> 00:38:57.813
And you, go get the electric saw.

00:38:57.813 --> 00:38:58.947
- Yes.
- Now!

The reason is unsatisfactory quality.

You say it too.

00:41:02.971 --> 00:41:04.139
I agree.

00:41:04.472 --> 00:41:05.540

It's nothing. Don't worry.

Please get changed.

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:49.411
Okay.

Ah Hyun.

00:43:19.741 --> 00:43:21.243
Can you help me?

00:43:25.046 --> 00:43:26.414
I'll explain in person.

00:43:27.249 --> 00:43:28.150
But...

00:43:28.884 --> 00:43:30.418
you have to come without anyone knowing.

Where are you now?

00:43:34.389 --> 00:43:35.257
Okay.

00:43:47.802 --> 00:43:48.970
You can't go out.

00:43:50.705 --> 00:43:51.673
No!

00:43:51.673 --> 00:43:52.908

Stand straight.

Stand straight.

Hey, what are you doing?

00:46:04.706 --> 00:46:05.640
Go over there.

00:46:24.192 --> 00:46:26.595
Everyone, remove your masks.

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:29.798
Masks off!

Remove your mask.

Stay where you are.

Stop.

Don't make that face!

No!

Mom.

00:51:44.779 --> 00:51:45.814
You lost.

00:51:46.748 --> 00:51:47.616
Mom?

00:51:50.585 --> 00:51:51.887
You're useless.

00:51:53.655 --> 00:51:54.589
Mom.

00:51:55.757 --> 00:51:57.759
Goodbye, Ah Hyun.

00:51:58.727 --> 00:51:59.728
Mom.

00:52:02.631 --> 00:52:03.565
Mom.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.034
Mom.

00:52:50.812 --> 00:52:51.880
Ah Hyun.

00:52:52.547 --> 00:52:57.419
You know the stepmother
from Snow White who says "Mirror, mirror?"

00:52:58.119 --> 00:53:01.022
She's not actually a stepmom.

00:53:01.590 --> 00:53:03.225
She's actually the real mother.

00:53:04.392 --> 00:53:07.729
The one who ordered the hunter
to bring her heart.

00:53:07.729 --> 00:53:08.997
That wasn't the stepmother.

00:53:10.065 --> 00:53:11.633
It was her real mother.

00:53:30.752 --> 00:53:31.686
Ah Hyun.

00:53:34.956 --> 00:53:35.991
My girl.

00:53:36.958 --> 00:53:37.993
How have you been?

00:53:44.032 --> 00:53:45.400
Why did you come here?

00:53:46.401 --> 00:53:47.836
You should've died back then.

00:54:27.576 --> 00:54:30.245
(The Defects)

00:54:30.245 --> 00:54:32.481
If something happens to Ah Hyun
while you're hesitating right now...

00:54:32.481 --> 00:54:33.949
Let's just think it through a little more.

00:54:33.949 --> 00:54:36.017
Whatever.
I'll go even if I have to go alone.

00:54:36.017 --> 00:54:38.053
Thinking it over,
she might actually be useful.

00:54:38.053 --> 00:54:39.287
Shouldn't at least one adult exist...

00:54:39.287 --> 00:54:41.289
to help those kids?

00:54:41.289 --> 00:54:43.658
Is that really the only way?

00:54:43.658 --> 00:54:44.826
You're not alone anymore.

00:54:44.826 --> 00:54:46.895
So let's go together.

00:54:46.895 --> 00:54:48.763
Was it you who killed Eun Gyeol?

00:54:48.763 --> 00:54:50.098
That bastard Yoon Ji Seok.

00:54:50.665 --> 00:54:51.600
He was your son.

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:52.901
He has to die.

00:54:52.901 --> 00:54:54.569
We were just supposed
to extract the good genes...

00:54:54.569 --> 00:54:56.371
and edit them.

00:54:56.371 --> 00:54:58.907
That way we wouldn't get discarded items
like this. Clean and simple, right?

00:54:59.841 --> 00:55:02.177
That's why I'm going to do just that.

00:55:02.611 --> 00:55:03.445
Nice to meet you.

00:55:03.678 --> 00:55:04.746
My Mary.

00:55:05.113 --> 00:55:08.183
I want to be a daughter
who's useful to my mom.

00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:09.885
Your son, Ji Seok.

00:55:10.418 --> 00:55:11.586
He's here.

00:55:13.281 --> 00:55:15.281
