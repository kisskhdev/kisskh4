WEBVTT

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:43.960
THE WINNING TRY

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:47.964
<i>And the result of that investment</i>
<i>was 25 losses, no wins.</i>

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:50.633
- They don't even have a coach now.
- <i>We do have a coach.</i>

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.510
Remember me?
I'm Ju Ga-ram, the rugby player.

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:55.764
<i>The idol of Korean rugby.</i>
<i>The MVP of the Asian Rugby Cup.</i>

00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:59.434
How can we hire someone
with a doping scandal? He's a disgrace!

00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:01.102
- Hi.
- Ju Ga-ram?

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:04.064
You ghosted me for three years
without a single word.

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:06.274
What? "How have you been?" Really?

00:01:06.357 --> 00:01:08.485
<i>You'll be the principal by then.</i>

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:10.195
<i>The Rugby Team will be of no help.</i>

00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:14.908
<i>Let's vote on his dismissal first.</i>

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:17.619
I'm suspended from coaching
until the voting, aren't I?

00:01:17.702 --> 00:01:19.120
<i>Please train the kids for me.</i>

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:20.455
Is this how you do it?

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:24.667
<i>- They're too much.</i>
- Is it their plan to dump them on us?

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.753
The dismissal petition
has been voted down.

00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:27.921
Yes!

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:30.799
No. I'll never accept you as the coach.

00:01:31.674 --> 00:01:33.635
Is it me that you hate or rugby?

00:01:33.718 --> 00:01:34.886
No, I didn't mean that.

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.680
Then let's play rugby together.

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:40.558
Soon you'll realize
that they're as hopeless as you.

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:45.313
In the second half…
Is there any way to win?

00:01:45.396 --> 00:01:47.398
From now on, let's play real rugby.

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:55.740
Coach!

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:58.785
<i>They got excited over scoring one try.</i>

00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:00.078
<i>There's no future here.</i>

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:08.837
Kang Tae-pung, the only first-year
on the Rugby Team,

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:13.925
questioned the coach's ability
and transferred to another school.

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:16.761
This wasn't our deal.

00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:19.597
That isn't really true.

00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:22.058
We still won, and Hanyang lost.

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:23.893
Their scoreless streak ended.

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:27.397
You know what a crushing defeat is,
don't you?

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.857
Well.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.859
I can still make it a crushing defeat.

00:02:32.443 --> 00:02:33.403
How?

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:42.287
As long as Ju Ga-ram is the coach,
they'll never recruit a new player.

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:47.083
What parents would entrust their kids
to a coach with a history of doping?

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.544
What are you trying to say?

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:54.090
The second half of the season begins
in less than a week.

00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:57.051
If he can't find a new player by then,

00:02:57.135 --> 00:03:01.264
the Rugby Team won't be able to play,
let alone win a prize.

00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:05.268
It's quite obvious
what we'd have to do with a team

00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:07.395
that can't even compete.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.985
Let's start talking about disbanding--

00:03:14.068 --> 00:03:15.069
We have a player.

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:21.951
Do you have a player?

00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:24.329
Where?

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:26.581
Where is he?

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:30.376
I'll introduce him
at the second semester's opening ceremony.

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:44.474
THE WINNING TRY

00:03:45.808 --> 00:03:47.477
EPISODE 3

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:52.440
Do you really have a player?

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:55.235
- Nope.
- Goodness.

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:57.904
I had my doubts, but was it really a lie?

00:03:57.987 --> 00:04:00.448
I just have to find one now.

00:04:00.531 --> 00:04:03.159
- You have to throw the first punch to win.
- Geez.

00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:09.624
Do you have a plan?

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:13.628
Well…

00:04:14.712 --> 00:04:15.546
Well?

00:04:18.716 --> 00:04:21.094
Hey, that's enough.

00:04:21.177 --> 00:04:24.847
How could you say that
when you're the vice-captain?

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:27.517
So what? It's not like we can do
anything about it.

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:30.186
- That jerk.
- Hey.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.438
Yeong-gwang is frustrated too. Seriously.

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:33.898
Tae-pung, that jerk.

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:35.775
He blocked me.

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:38.861
Let's go destroy him.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.280
- Let's go.
- No.

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:41.239
Hyeong-sik.

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:44.158
- No, don't.
- Calm down.

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:46.369
Stop right there.

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:54.502
What, are you going to kidnap him?

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:56.671
Will that bring him back?

00:04:56.754 --> 00:04:59.632
- We're just pissed off.
- We can't let him go like this.

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:01.676
Break-ups are always enraging.

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.679
Sending him off nicely
is better for everyone's sake.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.432
"For everyone's sake," my foot.

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:08.891
<i>The semester begins in three days.</i>

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:10.768
<i>I have to fill the opening…</i>

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:15.773
<i>with someone who will make us stronger.</i>

00:05:16.607 --> 00:05:18.067
What are you going to do?

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:21.779
Where can we get a new player
when the semester's about to begin?

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.200
Hey, let's go.

00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:29.329
Everyone, stop right there!

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:49.599
<i>Captain Yoon Seong-jun.</i>

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:52.393
<i>He is good…</i>

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:55.980
<i>but has a big attitude.</i>

00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:01.110
<i>The bigger problem is…</i>

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:06.741
Geez. What are you doing?

00:06:06.824 --> 00:06:08.534
Where's your core? How much do you weigh?

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:10.787
I weigh 75 kilograms.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.455
You need to bulk up.

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:14.082
And strengthen your adductors.

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:17.543
You fight off a tackle
with your lower body strength.

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:19.796
Why haven't you trained your body?

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:21.589
- Back in my day…
- Are you a boomer?

00:06:21.672 --> 00:06:23.800
That's one of my charms.

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:27.512
<i>Pyo Seon-ho, a second-year.</i>

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.557
<i>What he needs is…</i>

00:06:39.398 --> 00:06:41.818
Is this supposed to be
a handle or something?

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:43.569
- I'm going to lose it.
- No.

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:46.280
Fill it out with muscles.

00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:47.824
Okay.

00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:53.621
<i>Kim Ju-yang.</i>

00:06:55.998 --> 00:06:57.625
<i>He has a great physique,</i>

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.419
<i>but he's too slow.</i>

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:04.507
<i>Still, this is…</i>

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.092
- You're good to go.
- Really?

00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:13.683
<i>Do Hyeong-sik.</i>

00:07:16.477 --> 00:07:19.063
<i>Why can't he stop fighting…</i>

00:07:21.023 --> 00:07:22.358
<i>when he's so small?</i>

00:07:27.363 --> 00:07:30.241
<i>So Myeong-u. He slacks off,</i>
<i>but his basics are solid.</i>

00:07:35.037 --> 00:07:35.955
You're good to go.

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:44.338
<i>With Yeong-gwang and his precise kicking,</i>
<i>we have six players.</i>

00:07:46.757 --> 00:07:48.092
What are you staring at?

00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:49.302
<i>In that case,</i>

00:07:50.094 --> 00:07:52.472
<i>the last player should be…</i>

00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:54.140
Okay, I've made my decision!

00:07:54.223 --> 00:07:57.101
I'll recruit a big, fast player.

00:07:57.185 --> 00:08:00.688
In other words, find the next Ga-ram!

00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:06.819
Hello.

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:15.453
Hello.

00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:19.707
Sorry.

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:26.881
I'll visit you soon. Yes.

00:08:27.715 --> 00:08:28.758
Tell all the coaches

00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:31.135
to submit a draft budget
for the fall season.

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:32.887
- Okay.
- This year, we'll go by results…

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.055
TEACHER'S ID

00:08:34.138 --> 00:08:36.807
DATA ROOM
RESTRICTED AREA

00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:47.652
SPECIAL ADMISSION DATA 2021-2025

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:55.451
Geez.

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:57.370
PERSON IN CHARGE: BAE I-JI

00:08:57.453 --> 00:08:58.287
Bae I-ji?

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:00.915
Darn it.

00:09:00.998 --> 00:09:02.083
Coach Ju?

00:09:10.299 --> 00:09:12.677
- What are you doing here?
- Well…

00:09:13.344 --> 00:09:14.637
The Shooting Team's… No!

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.723
I was looking for the documents
on the Rugby Team's past training.

00:09:19.308 --> 00:09:21.811
Your first day starts tomorrow.
Am I wrong?

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:24.897
Where did you get the ID card?

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:26.857
I got it from Principal Kang.

00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:30.319
I'll get going, then.

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:31.737
Bye.

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.182
Why did it have to be I-ji of all people?

00:10:01.475 --> 00:10:02.435
Geez.

00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:04.228
HANYANG HIGH WINS!

00:10:05.187 --> 00:10:06.647
SHOOTING RANGE

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:20.161
How are their conditions?

00:10:20.911 --> 00:10:22.371
They're all good.

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.707
Seol-hyeon went to get physical therapy.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:25.875
Okay.

00:10:27.918 --> 00:10:28.836
I-ji, a moment.

00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:34.091
You know Ga-ram well, don't you?

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:36.093
Where is this player he's talking about?

00:10:36.677 --> 00:10:37.637
Do you have any idea?

00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:40.014
No.

00:10:40.097 --> 00:10:41.057
Darn it.

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:43.684
You two went out for a long time.

00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:45.353
You'd know him inside and out.

00:10:45.436 --> 00:10:46.771
I really have no idea.

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:48.606
Is that so?

00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:50.858
I guess…

00:10:52.026 --> 00:10:54.695
Ga-ram was a national athlete
and a starting member,

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:58.616
while you weren't even close.
You probably weren't together much.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.245
Still, as soon as you hear anything,
let me know.

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:06.707
U-jin, keep your eye on the line of sight.
Your breath is too short.

00:11:10.127 --> 00:11:13.047
Why would she listen to you?
She's a high-ranker.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.298
I'm back.

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:15.424
Hey!

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:17.301
Seol-hyeon, what did the doctor say?

00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:18.719
How is your ligament?

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:21.222
It's a bit strained,
but it won't affect training.

00:11:21.305 --> 00:11:22.807
That's good news.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:25.601
Did you explain it well to your father?

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:26.977
Yes.

00:11:27.478 --> 00:11:29.605
How many times did U-jin shoot?

00:11:29.688 --> 00:11:31.107
How many shots did she take?

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.192
She shot 191 times.
She has nine shots left.

00:11:33.275 --> 00:11:34.652
A total of 200?

00:11:35.194 --> 00:11:37.196
I'll shoot 200 times too, then.

00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:38.823
Geez, you're hurt, though.

00:11:38.906 --> 00:11:40.408
You don't have to overwork.

00:11:40.491 --> 00:11:42.326
It's all right. I'll get ready.

00:11:46.914 --> 00:11:49.625
Seol-hyeon, why don't you leave
an empty lane in between?

00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:53.421
But I like this lane.

00:11:53.504 --> 00:11:55.297
She likes that lane.

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:58.968
Why would you tell her
to leave an empty lane?

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:01.637
I-ji.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.598
I'm saying this for your own good.

00:12:04.682 --> 00:12:07.893
A coach needs to be quick-witted.

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:09.937
You know Seol-hyeon likes this lane.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.398
Then you should have left
both lanes next to it open.

00:12:12.481 --> 00:12:14.150
- That's being witty--
- I'm done.

00:12:20.614 --> 00:12:22.741
Who's taking their feet off? Stop that.

00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:25.369
How can you be a shooter
when you can't even stand right?

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:31.250
After 170 shots,
your breathing became shallow.

00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:32.668
Check it on the record.

00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:36.213
I sped it up on purpose
to practice pace control.

00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:41.802
I left some feedback on your training.
It'll help you.

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:45.890
Okay.

00:12:48.517 --> 00:12:50.227
MOM

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:55.107
GO ALL IN WHEN TRAINING
LET YOUR RESULTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:56.859
MOM

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.195
Yes, Mom.

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:19.048
Darn it.

00:13:24.136 --> 00:13:25.513
- I-ji.
- Beat it.

00:13:25.596 --> 00:13:27.264
- I need a favor.
- Beat it.

00:13:27.348 --> 00:13:29.391
Can I get the keys for the data room?

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:30.726
Beat it.

00:13:30.809 --> 00:13:31.810
I-ji.

00:13:32.353 --> 00:13:34.980
Can you lend me the keys?

00:13:36.106 --> 00:13:37.066
Are you crazy?

00:13:37.149 --> 00:13:41.070
Please grant me some mercy
and bestow the keys to me.

00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:43.322
Shoot him at once!

00:13:43.405 --> 00:13:44.240
Bang, bang.

00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:46.242
Geez. This isn't going to work.

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:55.793
DORMITORY DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

00:13:55.876 --> 00:13:56.794
I-ji.

00:14:08.889 --> 00:14:10.182
TEACHER'S ID

00:14:11.475 --> 00:14:12.726
DATA ROOM

00:14:29.159 --> 00:14:31.161
Focus, will you?

00:14:39.211 --> 00:14:40.045
<i>I-ji.</i>

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:49.555
The target is Ga-ram.

00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:54.101
That's Ga-ram.

00:15:10.951 --> 00:15:14.121
DATA ROOM

00:15:32.306 --> 00:15:34.266
EMERGENCY BELL

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:40.522
What is it?

00:15:43.192 --> 00:15:45.486
- What?
- What's going on?

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:49.740
What's going on?

00:16:06.548 --> 00:16:08.425
<i>We got the call. Where are you?</i>

00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:09.593
I'm at the data room.

00:16:15.432 --> 00:16:16.475
DATA ROOM
RESTRICTED AREA

00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:35.786
Who's there?

00:16:36.537 --> 00:16:37.621
Show yourself.

00:16:44.336 --> 00:16:45.170
Ga-ram?

00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:47.047
I made a wrong turn.

00:16:47.131 --> 00:16:49.842
- Geez. Where am I?
- Are you out of your mind?

00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:57.766
What in the world are you doing?

00:16:59.643 --> 00:17:01.812
- I'll get going.
- Don't try to fool me.

00:17:01.895 --> 00:17:03.939
Hurry up and leave.

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:06.066
Get out of here. Quickly.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.527
- Come on.
- Geez, I-ji.

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:11.447
I'm telling you
a shooter shouldn't point guns at people.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:12.906
- They think it's real.
- I'll shoot.

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:14.366
- Okay.
- Three.

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:15.367
- I'm going.
- Two.

00:17:15.451 --> 00:17:16.577
- I'm on my way.
- One.

00:17:23.333 --> 00:17:24.209
I-ji.

00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:26.003
- Hey!
- I-ji.

00:17:26.086 --> 00:17:28.005
It's nothing, guys.

00:17:28.088 --> 00:17:29.673
Get inside.

00:17:39.641 --> 00:17:40.893
Go back inside.

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:48.609
- Hey.
- Coach Ju.

00:17:48.692 --> 00:17:49.860
- That's our coach.
- Coach.

00:17:49.943 --> 00:17:51.528
- Why is he there?
- Coach.

00:17:51.612 --> 00:17:53.030
No matter how urgent,

00:17:53.113 --> 00:17:56.075
you can't treat a person like that.

00:17:56.158 --> 00:17:57.117
I know.

00:17:57.701 --> 00:18:01.205
We should have waited,
but we thought it was a thief.

00:18:01.288 --> 00:18:06.460
We have armories and dangerous equipment
since this is a physical education school,

00:18:06.543 --> 00:18:08.796
and we're extra sensitive to intruders.

00:18:08.879 --> 00:18:12.508
Since it was reported,
you'll have to come to the station.

00:18:12.591 --> 00:18:14.009
Yes, of course.

00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:15.427
Who made the call?

00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:17.930
Who called the police?

00:18:18.013 --> 00:18:18.972
Was it I-ji?

00:18:22.976 --> 00:18:25.062
- Did you call the police?
- I did, but…

00:18:26.814 --> 00:18:28.065
Please come with us.

00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:34.321
Geez, they're here again.

00:18:34.404 --> 00:18:35.906
For goodness' sake.

00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:43.455
So you're telling me,
he's a soon-to-be school coach?

00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:44.498
Yes, for now.

00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:45.999
Nothing has gone missing.

00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:46.917
ID CARD
JU GA-RAM

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.335
We've confirmed his identity.

00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:57.177
- You two can go now.
- Thank you.

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:04.184
Sit straight, dude.

00:19:18.699 --> 00:19:19.616
Geez.

00:19:21.785 --> 00:19:22.828
What are you doing?

00:19:22.911 --> 00:19:27.457
I was complimenting
how you made an accurate shot.

00:19:27.541 --> 00:19:29.293
No, I mean y<i>ou</i>. What are <i>you</i> doing?

00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:38.051
What's with you?

00:19:40.762 --> 00:19:42.806
I just don't get it.

00:19:43.432 --> 00:19:46.560
You can't come back
after leaving like that. No way.

00:19:46.643 --> 00:19:47.978
But you did,

00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:48.979
while looking…

00:19:50.522 --> 00:19:51.523
like this.

00:19:52.983 --> 00:19:54.568
I don't look great, do I?

00:19:56.486 --> 00:19:57.571
I know.

00:19:57.654 --> 00:19:58.989
If you do…

00:19:59.072 --> 00:19:59.948
But I-ji,

00:20:01.366 --> 00:20:03.785
I didn't have any other option.

00:20:06.496 --> 00:20:10.000
I knew I'd end up like this.

00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:13.420
I know…

00:20:16.423 --> 00:20:18.634
I know I'm thick-skinned and shameless,

00:20:21.011 --> 00:20:22.012
but I…

00:20:24.765 --> 00:20:26.099
want to play rugby again.

00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:32.606
Then go to a pro team.

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:34.983
Why did it have to be Hanyang High?

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:36.902
You knew I'd be here.

00:20:37.486 --> 00:20:39.321
Why did you come here of all places?

00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:41.949
Ju Ga-ram!

00:20:44.284 --> 00:20:45.744
Everything I was looking for…

00:20:47.454 --> 00:20:48.956
was here.

00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:54.169
I missed them so much

00:20:55.587 --> 00:20:58.840
that I couldn't endure it anymore.

00:21:28.412 --> 00:21:29.746
<i>Everything I was looking for…</i>

00:21:31.581 --> 00:21:33.208

00:21:34.835 --> 00:21:36.086

00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:41.133
that I couldn't endure it anymore.

00:22:24.134 --> 00:22:24.968
Seong-jun.

00:22:26.636 --> 00:22:27.721
Hi.

00:22:35.437 --> 00:22:36.438
Hey, Seong-jun.

00:22:38.523 --> 00:22:39.649
We'll use the field.

00:22:40.317 --> 00:22:41.693
As if you haven't been.

00:22:43.612 --> 00:22:45.864
Is your coach still at the station?

00:22:45.947 --> 00:22:47.824
You guys are truly something else.

00:22:47.908 --> 00:22:50.118
I can't hear your bullcrap.

00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:51.036
Who knows?

00:22:51.119 --> 00:22:53.288
Your coach might recruit a thug
from prison.

00:22:53.955 --> 00:22:55.165
It's a lockup, not a prison.

00:22:55.248 --> 00:22:58.043
His ID has been confirmed,
and nothing has been stolen.

00:22:58.126 --> 00:23:00.504
He must be out already, so beat it.

00:23:00.587 --> 00:23:03.090
I see. Why isn't he here, then?

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.344
Did he quit out of embarrassment
over failing to recruit someone?

00:23:13.809 --> 00:23:15.185
I'd love to kick his butt.

00:23:15.268 --> 00:23:17.771
That tall jerk.
Should I punch him in the stomach?

00:23:17.854 --> 00:23:18.688
Kick that butt.

00:23:18.772 --> 00:23:20.107
COACH JU GA-RAM
WHERE ARE YOU?

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:21.566
Where is Ga-ram?

00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:25.112
You two went to the station together.

00:23:25.821 --> 00:23:28.657
I came back after the investigation.

00:23:29.157 --> 00:23:30.700
I don't know about him.

00:23:32.119 --> 00:23:34.329
It sounds
like he didn't come back to school.

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:39.793
I'll give him a call.

00:23:39.876 --> 00:23:41.419
No, forget it.

00:23:43.004 --> 00:23:45.882
How much do you need
for the extra electronic targets?

00:23:45.966 --> 00:23:47.968
The more the better.

00:23:48.051 --> 00:23:49.803
It's over 10 million won a piece.

00:23:49.886 --> 00:23:53.682
We have to use up the Rugby Team's
second-semester budget.

00:23:53.765 --> 00:23:55.851
Tell each team to check
what needs to be replaced

00:23:55.934 --> 00:23:58.186
- and submit the budget.
- Okay.

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:01.773
The disbandment hasn't been finalized.
Can we spend their budget already?

00:24:01.857 --> 00:24:03.567
This will disband the team for sure.

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:06.528
The semester begins in three days,
but they're short a player.

00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:08.780
Their best record was second place.

00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:10.490
Was that 15 years ago?

00:24:11.158 --> 00:24:13.368
Since then, they've never ranked high.

00:24:14.411 --> 00:24:16.079
They happen to be short a player,

00:24:16.163 --> 00:24:19.457
and their coach is no good.
It might be best to disband the team.

00:24:21.376 --> 00:24:23.795
What if he went to recruit a player?

00:24:32.179 --> 00:24:33.096
Come on. Open it.

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:43.315

00:25:37.786 --> 00:25:40.664
Okay. Let's do this.

00:26:05.272 --> 00:26:06.898
Ma'am, take a look.

00:26:07.524 --> 00:26:09.109
- Ma'am.
- Can I ask a question?

00:26:09.192 --> 00:26:11.403
- Do you know Ung's Diner?
- Go away if you're not buying.

00:26:11.486 --> 00:26:12.320
Sorry.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:21.329
Excuse me, sir.

00:26:21.413 --> 00:26:22.956
- They're 50,000 won.
- I see.

00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:25.542
Do you happen to know Ung's Diner?

00:26:25.625 --> 00:26:28.336
- Yes, Ung…
- Do you know where it is?

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.672
If you go straight,
you'll see a raw fish center.

00:26:33.717 --> 00:26:35.051
Captain.

00:26:35.135 --> 00:26:36.469
Look at this.

00:26:38.305 --> 00:26:39.139
This is…

On the other side.

00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:42.934
- Yeah.
- I see.

00:26:43.018 --> 00:26:46.396
<i>With rugby's spirit in my heart,</i>
<i>I'm on my way to recruit a player.</i>

00:26:47.355 --> 00:26:50.275
- <i>Armed with unstoppable determination</i>
- "Armed with unstoppable…"

00:26:50.358 --> 00:26:51.943
<i>the unity that makes us one,</i>

00:26:52.027 --> 00:26:54.946
<i>and a strong mindset to avoid tackles,</i>

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:59.242
<i>please cover for me in my absence.</i>

00:26:59.326 --> 00:27:01.369
"Bye, then."

00:27:01.453 --> 00:27:02.704
What?

00:27:03.288 --> 00:27:04.122
What? Give it to me.

00:27:06.833 --> 00:27:08.168
Where… Geez.

00:27:48.666 --> 00:27:49.834
Seriously.

00:27:50.752 --> 00:27:52.212
I think he ran away.

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:54.589
<i>The number you've dialed…</i>

00:27:54.672 --> 00:27:56.299
I can't believe I agree with Myeong-u.

00:27:56.383 --> 00:27:58.385
Something doesn't feel right.

00:27:58.968 --> 00:28:00.136
He said he went recruiting.

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:03.598
But why isn't he picking up?

00:28:03.681 --> 00:28:04.808
Someone's not picking up?

00:28:05.809 --> 00:28:06.935
- Who isn't?
- Pardon?

00:28:12.232 --> 00:28:15.610
One, two… Six. That's all?

00:28:15.693 --> 00:28:18.405
Last time, your captain went missing.
This time, your coach.

00:28:19.364 --> 00:28:21.241
All training should be carried out

00:28:21.324 --> 00:28:23.910
under the supervision
of a head coach or a coach.

00:28:23.993 --> 00:28:26.913
It's you guys again.
You're breaking the rules again.

00:28:26.996 --> 00:28:27.914
This is serious.

00:28:27.997 --> 00:28:31.376
It'll look serious
on the school report too.

00:28:31.459 --> 00:28:33.920
Well, Coach… is in the nurse's office.

00:28:36.339 --> 00:28:37.924
You're that guy.

00:28:38.007 --> 00:28:40.218
The one studying
to be a police officer. Right?

00:28:40.802 --> 00:28:41.678
Yes, sir.

00:28:41.761 --> 00:28:45.306
Someone who wants to become a cop

00:28:46.599 --> 00:28:47.767
wouldn't lie, would they?

00:28:51.688 --> 00:28:52.605
I'll go and check.

00:28:52.689 --> 00:28:53.815
- Pardon?
- Wait.

00:28:53.898 --> 00:28:55.316
Come on.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.110
- I mean…
- What?

00:29:03.575 --> 00:29:04.909
Are you out of your mind?

00:29:04.993 --> 00:29:06.536
- What now?
- I don't know.

00:29:06.619 --> 00:29:08.580
I was worried about my school report.

00:29:08.663 --> 00:29:10.498
- You're crazy.
- Should I knock him out?

00:29:11.332 --> 00:29:12.834
Hey.

00:29:14.836 --> 00:29:16.838
I'll take his hammer and…

00:29:19.257 --> 00:29:20.884
NURSE'S OFFICE

00:29:22.427 --> 00:29:23.261
What is it?

00:29:25.096 --> 00:29:28.099
I think Coach has COVID-19.

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.561
His throat must hurt.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.314
Yes.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.817
- You might get it from him--
- He isn't here, is he?

00:29:37.901 --> 00:29:40.111
Yes, he is.

00:29:40.695 --> 00:29:41.905
Well…

00:29:41.988 --> 00:29:43.490
Move.

00:29:45.325 --> 00:29:47.869
- Why are you here?
- What's going on?

00:29:47.952 --> 00:29:51.998
Ms. Yang, they're saying Ga-ram is here

00:29:52.665 --> 00:29:54.167
with COVID. Is that true?

00:30:01.049 --> 00:30:04.010
Yes. That might be true.

00:30:14.521 --> 00:30:15.647
Step aside so I can check.

00:30:16.356 --> 00:30:19.400
Your team's doping samples are in here,

00:30:19.484 --> 00:30:21.361
so you can't come in.

00:30:21.444 --> 00:30:22.779
That's nonsense.

00:30:22.862 --> 00:30:25.573
- It's just a preliminary test.
- A test is a test.

00:30:27.075 --> 00:30:28.451
What about her?

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.913
That was why I was driving her out too.

00:30:33.665 --> 00:30:35.291
Is this all true? Really?

00:30:41.714 --> 00:30:42.549
Yes, it's true.

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:51.057
I swear I won't touch the samples.

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:52.934
Let me just see if he's here.

00:30:53.977 --> 00:30:56.396
I'll report you
to the anti-doping agency for trespassing.

00:30:56.479 --> 00:30:57.730
- What?
- What!

00:30:57.814 --> 00:30:59.190
- What?
- What?

00:30:59.274 --> 00:31:01.860
- What?
- Get going.

00:31:01.943 --> 00:31:03.444
- Really?
- Really.

00:31:03.528 --> 00:31:04.863
- What?
- What!

00:31:04.946 --> 00:31:06.573
- What?
- Seriously.

00:31:09.742 --> 00:31:12.036
Geez.

00:31:14.163 --> 00:31:16.040
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:31:16.124 --> 00:31:16.958
Darn it.

00:31:19.085 --> 00:31:22.505
- Geez.
- I was this close to knocking him out.

00:31:22.589 --> 00:31:23.840
Coach Bae.

00:31:25.133 --> 00:31:26.593
Thank you so much.

00:31:26.676 --> 00:31:27.510
Thank you.

00:31:27.594 --> 00:31:29.762
I helped you this time,

00:31:29.846 --> 00:31:31.347
but I won't do it twice.

00:31:32.515 --> 00:31:34.934
- Bye.
- You're so pretty.

00:31:35.018 --> 00:31:37.687
She's so grumpy.

00:31:38.271 --> 00:31:40.607
So where is Ga-ram right now?

00:31:56.581 --> 00:31:57.415
I found it.

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:03.171
UNG'S DINER

00:32:08.801 --> 00:32:10.178
Is anybody here?

00:32:12.221 --> 00:32:14.098
Welcome. Are you here to eat?

00:32:14.182 --> 00:32:16.017
No, actually…

00:32:23.316 --> 00:32:25.234
You're Rhino, aren't you?

00:32:27.987 --> 00:32:29.155
Hold on.

00:32:29.238 --> 00:32:31.324
I saw the family background on the form,

00:32:31.407 --> 00:32:32.992
but I couldn't believe it.

00:32:33.076 --> 00:32:34.535
I thought the applicant's father

00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:38.581
had the same name as the rugby legend
known as the Rhino of the '90s.

00:32:38.665 --> 00:32:39.707
What did you say?

00:32:40.458 --> 00:32:41.292
Apply for what?

00:32:42.001 --> 00:32:43.378
Right.

00:32:45.171 --> 00:32:48.758
Please sign here.

HANYANG HIGH APPLICATION 2025

00:32:52.261 --> 00:32:53.096
SPECIAL ADMISSION

00:32:53.179 --> 00:32:55.014
SPORT: RUGBY,
NAME: MUN UNG

00:32:55.098 --> 00:32:56.474
GUARDIAN: MUN CHEOL-YEONG

00:32:58.017 --> 00:32:59.352
That's good too,

00:32:59.435 --> 00:33:01.229
but can you do it here first?

00:33:01.729 --> 00:33:05.858
Can you write, "Ju Ga-ram, good luck.
Congratulations on your comeback."?

00:33:07.902 --> 00:33:08.945
Ju Ga-ram?

00:33:09.529 --> 00:33:10.363
That juicer?

00:33:11.406 --> 00:33:13.658
- Do you know me?
- Get lost.

00:33:13.741 --> 00:33:15.368
I'm a fan, you're our senior.

00:33:17.286 --> 00:33:18.538
Are you all right?

00:33:19.664 --> 00:33:20.581
Let go of him!

00:33:25.837 --> 00:33:26.671
Are you okay?

00:33:29.382 --> 00:33:30.675
We'll pay the money back.

00:33:30.758 --> 00:33:32.844
Why do you keep harassing us?

00:33:42.353 --> 00:33:44.272
It's you. Mun Ung!

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:47.025
What are you doing?

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.944
Look how firm your skeletal muscles are.

00:33:50.028 --> 00:33:52.363
- Wow!
- What's with you? Seriously.

00:33:53.656 --> 00:33:55.700
- For goodness' sake.
- Father.

00:33:55.783 --> 00:33:57.827
- Wow!
- Father.

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:00.371
Father.

00:34:02.498 --> 00:34:04.751
HANYANG HIGH APPLICATION 2025

00:34:05.918 --> 00:34:07.587
HANYANG HIGH RUGBY COACH
JU GA-RAM

00:34:22.769 --> 00:34:27.023
So you want to recruit Ung
to Hanyang's Rugby Team. Is that it?

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:28.524
Yes.

00:34:30.985 --> 00:34:33.154
Do you even know what rugby is?

00:34:38.826 --> 00:34:42.121
Rugby is a very pure, passionate,
and humane sport.

00:34:42.205 --> 00:34:45.875
The bond between people
is the essence of this sport.

00:34:46.584 --> 00:34:50.463
You might say,
"Isn't it an unpopular sport?"

00:34:50.546 --> 00:34:52.632
but I'd argue it's an unrecognized sport.

00:34:52.715 --> 00:34:54.258
It's unrecognized for now,

00:34:54.342 --> 00:34:56.803
but it's slowly yet surely progressing.

00:34:58.846 --> 00:35:01.474
You can get accepted
into prestigious colleges through rugby.

00:35:01.557 --> 00:35:05.353
The number of pro teams
are increasing too.

00:35:21.202 --> 00:35:23.704
I saw this coming.
I have plenty more ready.

00:35:24.539 --> 00:35:25.581
Here.

00:35:27.041 --> 00:35:28.543
Ung, do you want to go there?

00:35:34.882 --> 00:35:35.716
No.

00:35:37.552 --> 00:35:39.929
See? Now, get going.

00:35:40.721 --> 00:35:41.931
Does he mean it?

00:35:42.014 --> 00:35:43.891
We have nothing more to say. Go!

00:35:45.935 --> 00:35:47.186
You're our senior!

00:35:50.523 --> 00:35:52.692
Your senior? Me?

00:35:52.775 --> 00:35:55.695
Well, since you've screwed up your life
playing rugby too,

00:35:55.778 --> 00:35:57.238
I guess you can call me that.

00:35:58.865 --> 00:36:00.283
Did you see how I was?

00:36:02.702 --> 00:36:06.956
You know very well
why I ended up like this. Right?

00:36:08.875 --> 00:36:09.876
That's why

00:36:10.751 --> 00:36:13.296
I don't want my son
to walk the same path as me.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.006
Go away!

00:36:23.264 --> 00:36:24.265
Father!

00:37:06.891 --> 00:37:07.767
I'm so sorry.

00:37:09.518 --> 00:37:11.103
You don't have to be.

00:37:13.856 --> 00:37:16.651
But aren't you the one? The…

00:37:16.734 --> 00:37:18.110
Yes.

00:37:18.194 --> 00:37:22.531
Ju Ga-ram, who used illegal substances
and screwed up his life.

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:27.453
If so, can I get a handshake?

00:37:30.122 --> 00:37:31.624
- What?
- Well…

00:37:32.333 --> 00:37:34.335
I watched the Asian Cup Final.

00:37:35.294 --> 00:37:38.297
I watched it without telling my father.
You were awesome.

00:37:38.965 --> 00:37:41.092
I was, indeed.

00:37:42.468 --> 00:37:43.386
All right.

00:37:47.056 --> 00:37:48.683
Hey, Ung.

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:51.519
Do you really not want to play rugby?

00:37:59.151 --> 00:38:00.695
UNG'S DINER

00:38:01.612 --> 00:38:03.698
I submitted the application just for fun.

00:38:07.076 --> 00:38:09.036
I have a delivery to make.

00:38:11.038 --> 00:38:11.914
Bye, then.

00:38:20.548 --> 00:38:24.010
If that's the case,
I can't give up after all.

00:38:29.098 --> 00:38:31.100
- Hello.
- It's you, Ung.

00:38:31.183 --> 00:38:32.518
- Hi.
- Nice work.

00:38:32.601 --> 00:38:34.437
- Gosh, what a load.
- Hello.

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:35.938
Goodness, isn't it heavy?

00:38:36.022 --> 00:38:37.481
It's all right.

00:38:37.565 --> 00:38:40.401
Geez, you'll break your neck.

00:38:40.985 --> 00:38:42.486
Why did you carry them all at once?

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:43.446
Come on, ma'am.

00:38:44.488 --> 00:38:45.656
- Thank you.
- See you.

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:46.615
- Thanks.
- Okay.

00:38:46.699 --> 00:38:48.451
Hello, sir.

00:38:48.534 --> 00:38:50.494
- Thank you.
- I'll pay on the weekend.

00:38:50.578 --> 00:38:51.829
Okay.

00:38:51.912 --> 00:38:53.247
Hey, you're here, Ung.

00:38:53.331 --> 00:38:54.373
Enjoy.

00:38:54.457 --> 00:38:55.416
- Bye.
- See you.

00:38:55.499 --> 00:38:56.375
Okay.

00:39:26.155 --> 00:39:29.742
Auntie Suk-ja gave us some fruit.
Should I slice some?

00:39:36.624 --> 00:39:39.168
Or this will be ready after a quick boil.

00:39:39.752 --> 00:39:40.795
Would you like some?

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.048
Have a seat.

00:39:56.685 --> 00:39:57.937
You'll have a hangover.

00:40:01.524 --> 00:40:03.067
Why did you apply to that school?

00:40:05.361 --> 00:40:07.488
There must be a reason. Tell me.

00:40:08.739 --> 00:40:10.658
- It was just…
- What?

00:40:13.786 --> 00:40:15.788
I just wanted to get tested.

00:40:15.871 --> 00:40:16.705
And then?

00:40:18.165 --> 00:40:23.003
If you passed the test and got in,
what were you going to do?

00:40:26.924 --> 00:40:28.843
Geez, Ung.

00:40:28.926 --> 00:40:32.721
You see it every day, don't you?

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:38.352
You see just how badly
I ruined my life by playing sports.

00:40:41.355 --> 00:40:45.276
Playing sports is like gambling.

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:49.655
One wrong move and you're out.

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:53.909
Just tell me you want
to learn something else, anything.

00:40:53.993 --> 00:40:57.663
Didn't I tell you?
I'll even sell the diner to support you.

00:40:57.746 --> 00:40:58.789
It's not like that.

00:41:00.332 --> 00:41:01.208
Father.

00:41:03.919 --> 00:41:05.254
I'm not going to play sports.

00:41:30.779 --> 00:41:33.157
MUN CHEOL-YEONG

00:41:46.921 --> 00:41:48.839
FROM BEING A HERO TO BROKE AND DISABLED

00:41:48.923 --> 00:41:50.424
MUN, AT THE END OF THE ROPE

00:41:57.139 --> 00:41:59.600
CHRONIC INJURY STOPS
RUGBY LEGEND MUN

00:41:59.683 --> 00:42:01.769
MUN LOSES A SUIT TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY

00:42:01.852 --> 00:42:04.063
MUN'S KNEE LIGAMENT RUPTURES,
A RED LIGHT ON HIS CAREER

00:42:04.146 --> 00:42:06.357
WITH 5% OF HIS LIGAMENT LEFT
DREAMS AND FUTURE FADE

00:42:17.034 --> 00:42:19.245
One, two, three, four.

00:42:19.328 --> 00:42:21.997
One, two, three, four.

00:42:22.081 --> 00:42:26.961
U-20 RUGBY NATIONAL TEAM

00:42:27.545 --> 00:42:29.088
- One, two,
- Louder.

00:42:29.171 --> 00:42:32.758
…three, four. One, two, three, four.

00:42:32.841 --> 00:42:34.552
One, two, three, four.

00:42:34.635 --> 00:42:38.764
- One.
- Two, three.

00:42:38.847 --> 00:42:41.600
SPECIALIZING IN KOREAN FOOD
GROUP ORDERS ARE WELCOME

00:42:46.981 --> 00:42:48.649
We have all 35. I've counted.

00:42:48.732 --> 00:42:51.068
Okay. Let's go.

00:42:51.151 --> 00:42:52.069
Okay.

00:43:14.383 --> 00:43:15.301
Why are you here?

00:43:17.052 --> 00:43:19.680
I'm the one who ordered the lunch boxes.

00:43:22.141 --> 00:43:25.561
The Junior Rugby National Team
does its off-season training here.

00:43:26.687 --> 00:43:29.231
As their senior,
I ought to buy them lunch.

00:43:30.357 --> 00:43:33.068
Is that it? We should give it to them
while it's still hot.

00:43:33.986 --> 00:43:36.822
If it goes cold,
it'll be harder to digest.

00:43:38.574 --> 00:43:42.077
If they get an upset stomach,
it might even affect their training.

00:43:44.455 --> 00:43:45.289
Go ahead.

00:43:46.707 --> 00:43:47.541
Okay.

00:43:51.253 --> 00:43:53.881
Goodness. It smells good.

00:44:08.312 --> 00:44:10.105
- U-20!
- Go!

00:44:14.777 --> 00:44:16.362
Let's go!

00:44:23.786 --> 00:44:25.496
Find your spot.

00:44:26.664 --> 00:44:27.915
You have to dash.

00:44:27.998 --> 00:44:29.249
Find your spot.

00:45:04.118 --> 00:45:06.703
Aren't you Mun Cheol-yeong?

00:45:06.787 --> 00:45:08.956
No. I don't know him.

00:45:55.043 --> 00:45:57.171
Run!

00:45:58.046 --> 00:46:00.090
- Stop him.
- Stop him.

00:46:02.885 --> 00:46:05.012
Sorry. Can you throw us the ball?

00:46:15.272 --> 00:46:16.398
Use both hands.

00:46:18.817 --> 00:46:20.277
Throw it with both hands.

00:46:22.279 --> 00:46:23.530
You're a lefty, right?

00:46:25.032 --> 00:46:27.451
Put your left hand
on the back of the ball,

00:46:28.243 --> 00:46:29.953
and grab the front with your right hand.

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:35.250
- Like this?
- Yes.

00:46:36.251 --> 00:46:38.795
Kick off the ground with your legs

00:46:39.421 --> 00:46:42.132
while naturally stretching your arms
forward like this.

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:47.221
That's it.

00:46:48.222 --> 00:46:49.056
Try throwing it.

00:47:09.576 --> 00:47:10.536
You're good.

00:47:22.256 --> 00:47:23.590
A special admission?

00:47:29.888 --> 00:47:31.807
Is there such a thing at the school?

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:34.893
It's a way to recruit a player

00:47:34.977 --> 00:47:37.312
to fill up a vacancy caused by an injury.

00:47:37.396 --> 00:47:38.272
What's the process?

00:47:38.355 --> 00:47:42.401
After passing a physical ability test
such as running and long jump,

00:47:42.484 --> 00:47:47.197
they can join
if there's a coach who wants them.

00:47:47.281 --> 00:47:48.574
What he's saying is

00:47:48.657 --> 00:47:53.495
if Ga-ram brings one player
that can pass the skill test,

00:47:53.579 --> 00:47:55.372
they will have enough players.

00:47:55.455 --> 00:47:59.251
This could delay the disbandment.

00:48:01.461 --> 00:48:02.671
What do we do then?

00:48:02.754 --> 00:48:05.591
I promised Seol-hyeon
that I'd upgrade the Shooting Team

00:48:05.674 --> 00:48:08.719
with state-of-the-art equipment
in the second semester.

00:48:09.886 --> 00:48:13.307
Does this mean
it'll be impossible to disband them?

00:48:25.861 --> 00:48:26.695
Cheol-yeong.

00:48:30.282 --> 00:48:31.199
Run.

00:49:04.399 --> 00:49:05.442
We're on our way.

00:49:09.655 --> 00:49:10.656
Father.

00:49:11.323 --> 00:49:12.407
What happened?

00:49:14.201 --> 00:49:15.160
How's your leg?

00:49:15.243 --> 00:49:16.620
How is it?

00:49:16.703 --> 00:49:17.788
Is it numb or anything?

00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:19.831
It's all right.

00:49:19.915 --> 00:49:21.541
What about anywhere else?

00:49:21.625 --> 00:49:22.876
Your neck and shoulders?

00:49:22.959 --> 00:49:25.754
Are you Mr. Mun Cheol-yeong's guardian?

00:49:25.837 --> 00:49:28.256
Yes. Was there an accident?

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:30.842
It wasn't a serious one.

00:49:30.926 --> 00:49:34.846
While driving, he didn't see the curve

00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:36.807
and crashed into a pile

00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:40.268
- of fertilizer…
- Were you with him on the rugby field?

00:49:50.112 --> 00:49:51.738
- Yes.
- Ung.

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:54.574
You won't do it, right?

00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:59.454
He didn't see the construction site ahead.

00:49:59.538 --> 00:50:00.414
Answer me.

00:50:01.957 --> 00:50:03.041
No, right?

00:50:09.005 --> 00:50:10.507
- Ung, you!
- Father.

00:50:14.136 --> 00:50:15.137
I…

00:50:17.723 --> 00:50:19.224
I'm holding myself back…

00:50:21.935 --> 00:50:23.937
with everything I have.

00:50:27.315 --> 00:50:28.859
So please,

00:50:31.319 --> 00:50:32.904
stop asking.

00:50:42.497 --> 00:50:43.623
He wasn't badly hurt.

00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:47.919
Just minor abrasion. Yes.

00:50:48.628 --> 00:50:49.629
Father.

00:50:49.713 --> 00:50:52.382
What is your relationship to the patient?

00:50:52.466 --> 00:50:54.050
- I'm his fellow…
- Stop harassing us.

00:50:54.134 --> 00:50:55.260
Father.

00:50:55.343 --> 00:50:59.765
Leave me and my son alone, will you?

00:50:59.848 --> 00:51:00.974
What are you doing?

00:51:01.057 --> 00:51:03.143
- What are you doing?
- You jerk!

00:51:03.226 --> 00:51:04.186
Sir.

00:51:04.269 --> 00:51:06.605
- Stop.
- Who are you to bother us?

00:51:06.688 --> 00:51:07.689
Father!

00:51:08.732 --> 00:51:10.108
Let go of me!

00:51:10.192 --> 00:51:11.026
I told you to leave!

00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:13.028
- Stop it!
- I told you to leave.

00:51:13.111 --> 00:51:14.154
Let go of me.

00:51:14.237 --> 00:51:17.407
Didn't I tell you to leave?

00:51:17.491 --> 00:51:18.825
Stop it. Please!

00:51:18.909 --> 00:51:20.869
Leave us alone, will you?

00:51:20.952 --> 00:51:21.953
Let go of me, you punk!

00:51:22.454 --> 00:51:25.624
Who are you to be stirring us up!

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:35.342
Who do you think you are?

00:51:36.176 --> 00:51:38.470
I told you to leave us alone.

00:51:39.721 --> 00:51:41.681
Leave me alone.

00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:44.184
Just leave me alone!

00:51:44.267 --> 00:51:46.603
Stop it!

00:51:52.984 --> 00:51:55.278
Can't you leave me alone?

00:51:56.488 --> 00:51:57.614
Leave me…

00:52:08.667 --> 00:52:09.960
POLICE STATION

00:52:10.043 --> 00:52:11.169
It hurts.

00:52:21.054 --> 00:52:22.931
Sir.

00:52:23.014 --> 00:52:24.933
- Geez.
- Apologize and let's settle it.

00:52:29.855 --> 00:52:32.232
What's the settlement condition?
Hospital bills?

00:52:32.315 --> 00:52:33.149
No.

00:52:33.233 --> 00:52:35.610
Then what?
You won't get much from a trial.

00:52:38.154 --> 00:52:39.489
I'll apologize for him.

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:43.118
- My father--
- You did it on purpose, didn't you?

00:52:43.201 --> 00:52:44.327
Having us deliver there?

00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:47.372
Yes!

00:52:48.039 --> 00:52:48.915
You're right.

00:52:48.999 --> 00:52:50.250
I did it on purpose!

00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:56.548
I thought of a condition.

00:52:56.631 --> 00:52:57.674
What is it?

00:52:57.757 --> 00:52:58.884
A walk.

00:52:59.718 --> 00:53:00.760
A what?

00:53:00.844 --> 00:53:04.389
Go on a walk with me, Mr. Mun.

00:53:11.354 --> 00:53:12.188
Father.

00:53:13.189 --> 00:53:14.733
Father, please!

00:53:17.819 --> 00:53:18.862
Go home first.

00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:21.948
I have to do this.

00:53:47.641 --> 00:53:49.184
Say it.

00:53:51.853 --> 00:53:54.856
Don't you think it's a shame
to waste Ung's talent?

00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.027
You know firsthand.

00:53:59.986 --> 00:54:02.530
It's the talent that took us both down.

00:54:04.991 --> 00:54:08.912
You have no conscience
if you blame it on talent.

00:54:09.537 --> 00:54:10.372
What?

00:54:12.791 --> 00:54:13.667
Look at me.

00:54:16.461 --> 00:54:21.174
I can say in good conscience
that I ended up like this

00:54:21.257 --> 00:54:23.093
because I was greedy.

00:54:28.974 --> 00:54:29.975
I regret…

00:54:32.644 --> 00:54:34.688
the moment I ever laid my hands
on those substances.

00:54:36.398 --> 00:54:37.273
That day,

00:54:39.776 --> 00:54:41.236
I should have trusted myself more.

00:54:42.904 --> 00:54:46.366
Or I should have trusted
my teammates more.

00:54:48.076 --> 00:54:49.744
Because of my greed,

00:54:50.787 --> 00:54:52.872
I didn't trust anything

00:54:52.956 --> 00:54:55.000
and ended up like this.

00:55:02.007 --> 00:55:04.467
I used to watch all your matches
when I was young.

00:55:05.301 --> 00:55:07.637
When you were on the field,

00:55:08.221 --> 00:55:10.098
it felt like we couldn't lose.

00:55:10.807 --> 00:55:13.560
You scored and defended all by yourself.

00:55:17.022 --> 00:55:17.939
But Mr. Mun,

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:21.693
you can't play rugby alone.

00:55:24.529 --> 00:55:26.114
You and I

00:55:27.282 --> 00:55:28.658
played rugby the wrong way.

00:55:30.785 --> 00:55:33.455
That is why we ended up like this.

00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:39.085
So don't blame it all on rugby.

00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:44.215
Both your knee injury
and my downfall were our fault,

00:55:44.299 --> 00:55:45.800
not rugby's.

00:55:46.885 --> 00:55:51.139
So stop hating rugby.

00:55:54.559 --> 00:55:56.853
Why did you come back?

00:55:59.355 --> 00:56:01.024
You know why.

00:56:02.942 --> 00:56:05.153
Hiding a medal you couldn't throw away,

00:56:06.321 --> 00:56:08.281
or returning when no one welcomes you.

00:56:09.199 --> 00:56:12.368
They're all for the same reason.

00:56:15.288 --> 00:56:16.164
Still,

00:56:17.373 --> 00:56:20.835
I want my son to live a life
that's different from mine.

00:56:22.754 --> 00:56:25.048
Do you think Ung's having a good life now?

00:56:26.049 --> 00:56:29.177
He's a high-school dropout
and a 19-year-old delivery guy.

00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:31.930
Is that the life you want for your son?

00:56:32.597 --> 00:56:37.644
You should ask 19-year-old Ung
what he wants for his life.

00:56:37.727 --> 00:56:40.522
- Don't you want to know?
- What if he wants to play rugby?

00:56:40.605 --> 00:56:42.148
Then let him!

00:56:42.732 --> 00:56:45.151
Let him play real rugby,
not like how we did.

00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:54.786
I believe that's the only thing
we can offer him,

00:56:55.912 --> 00:56:59.415
as people
who have experienced failures ourselves.

00:57:48.590 --> 00:57:51.301
<i>Do you think Ung's having a good life now?</i>

00:57:51.384 --> 00:57:54.971
He's a high-school dropout
and a 19-year-old delivery guy.

00:57:55.054 --> 00:57:57.640
Is that the life you want for your son?

00:58:51.986 --> 00:58:52.820
Hold on.

00:58:57.075 --> 00:58:57.909
How do I look?

00:59:00.703 --> 00:59:02.789
- What?
- Me.

00:59:02.872 --> 00:59:05.416
Am I not cool anymore
now that I got beat up?

00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:09.420
It wasn't your looks
that were cool anyway.

00:59:13.007 --> 00:59:14.175
Will you be sad when I leave?

00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:20.098
- No.
- Really?

00:59:27.272 --> 00:59:29.440
Here. Come with me.

00:59:29.941 --> 00:59:31.985
Do you see the time here? Don't be late.

00:59:32.068 --> 00:59:33.695
We must get there before the ceremony.

00:59:34.612 --> 00:59:35.488
I can't go.

00:59:36.406 --> 00:59:37.532
Really?

00:59:37.615 --> 00:59:38.992
Well, think about it.

00:59:52.255 --> 00:59:54.132
HIRING: EARLY MORNING DELIVERYMAN

01:00:06.519 --> 01:00:07.937
Why do you need an employee?

01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:10.523
I'll do it.

01:00:17.363 --> 01:00:18.573
You can stop now.

01:00:18.656 --> 01:00:20.658
- I'm not going to go.
- Why not?

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:24.203
I have to be here to shop groceries

01:00:24.912 --> 01:00:26.539
- and make deliveries.
- Mun Ung!

01:00:27.915 --> 01:00:29.876
Do you see me as disabled too?

01:00:30.668 --> 01:00:32.420
Why would you say that?

01:00:32.503 --> 01:00:33.546
Why?

01:00:39.385 --> 01:00:40.511
Dad, please!

01:00:45.391 --> 01:00:46.643
Why are you doing this?

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:52.857
I'm sorry.

01:00:56.986 --> 01:00:58.071
You wanted to go.

01:00:59.697 --> 01:01:00.573
I know.

01:01:01.616 --> 01:01:02.450
Ung.

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.411
I'm sorry.

01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:11.918
I held you back
just because it didn't work out for me.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.263
Hurry, your coach is waiting.

01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:57.505
UISAN BUS TERMINAL

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:02.885
UISAN-SEOUL

01:02:06.347 --> 01:02:08.015
This is the last time you'll be late.

01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:10.852
Coach.

01:02:13.354 --> 01:02:16.357
What now? I thought we had to get there
before the ceremony.

01:02:16.441 --> 01:02:18.443
They aren't many buses here.

01:02:18.526 --> 01:02:20.653
Don't worry. It's me, Ju Ga-ram.

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.114
He should be here by now.

01:02:38.045 --> 01:02:38.880
I'm not late, am I?

01:02:38.963 --> 01:02:41.424
- It'll be a close one.
- Hop in.

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:46.971
- What is all this?
- Welcome to the party.

01:02:47.054 --> 01:02:49.891
- Where have you been?
- Let's go!

01:02:53.853 --> 01:02:55.313
Ung, get in.

01:02:56.522 --> 01:03:03.488
2025 HANYANG HIGH
SECOND SEMESTER OPENING CEREMONY

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:35.770
Stay still. You're getting on my nerves.

01:03:37.271 --> 01:03:38.940
Cut me some slack today.

01:03:39.023 --> 01:03:40.942
I doubt you're more nervous than me.

01:03:41.025 --> 01:03:45.696
Sorry. You know how sensitive U-jin is.
By the way, where is your coach?

01:03:56.290 --> 01:03:58.084
I don't see the rugby coach.

01:03:59.168 --> 01:04:02.922
He must have run away
because he couldn't recruit a player.

01:04:04.715 --> 01:04:09.303
You're probably losing face
for bringing Ga-ram here.

01:04:09.387 --> 01:04:13.266
The ceremony hasn't begun yet.

01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:15.685
In sports, every second counts. Right?

01:04:37.665 --> 01:04:41.419
Now, we will begin the 2025

01:04:41.502 --> 01:04:42.837
second semester's--

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:43.921
Hold on!

01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:26.464
Our player is here.

01:05:27.423 --> 01:05:28.424
- He's here.
- He's here.

01:05:28.507 --> 01:05:29.717
- He came.
- What?

01:05:32.303 --> 01:05:33.846
RUGBY TEAM

01:05:39.685 --> 01:05:40.519
Really?

01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:41.729
Darn it.

01:05:44.857 --> 01:05:46.442
Is it someone's birthday?

01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:06.629
Move.

01:06:07.296 --> 01:06:09.131
- Nice.
- We have a player.

01:06:50.881 --> 01:06:52.008
What do we do then?

01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:53.259
EPILOGUE

01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:55.845
Does this mean
it'll be impossible to disband them?

01:06:56.512 --> 01:06:58.389
As of now, it seems so.

01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:02.810
But we have one day.

01:07:05.354 --> 01:07:09.775
The last change to special admissions
was five years ago.

01:07:10.359 --> 01:07:11.819
The old admission methods had…

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:51.984
THE WINNING TRY

01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:53.652
Each team will hold a tryout.

01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:55.780
<i>Ga-ram might try to outsmart us,</i>

01:07:55.863 --> 01:07:59.283
<i>so we picked the hardest events</i>
<i>among the technical sports.</i>

01:07:59.366 --> 01:08:01.077
<i>Have you got a plan?</i>

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:04.955
If you keep going without giving up,
you'll find a way.

01:08:05.039 --> 01:08:06.415
Don't you know the rugby spirit?

01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:09.877
I plan to give you some tasks

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:12.838
<i>such as keeping an eye on Coach Ju</i>
<i>and seeing what he's up to.</i>

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:14.256
<i>Can't you help me just this once?</i>

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:17.676
<i>- What is this?</i>
<i>- Our strategy.</i>

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.637
Your team's match is already over.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.472
No, it hasn't even begun yet.

01:08:21.555 --> 01:08:25.351
<i>You'll see. I'll show you that potential.</i>

01:08:31.023 --> 01:08:33.025
