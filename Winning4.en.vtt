WEBVTT

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:43.960
THE WINNING TRY

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.295
TWENTY YEARS AGO

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:46.838
2005 SPECIAL ADMISSION TRYOUTS

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:47.922
Ready.

00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:52.969
Jeong-hyo.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:58.433
I heard you brought him here.
Are you recruiting him as a new shooter?

00:00:58.516 --> 00:00:59.726
Not exactly.

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.228
When I saw him run,
I knew he'd do well anywhere.

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:05.023
I heard he beat a second-year in judo.

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:06.191
TRACK AND FIELD COACH

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:10.361
- Did he learn to play sports somewhere?
- Nothing professionally, I heard.

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:13.615
The judo coach is already
threatening everyone he called dibs.

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:15.033
Ready.

00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.919
I'm going to have to buy
the judo coach a drink.

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:27.629
He's a runner, not a judo player.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.467
He'll make a clean sweep of the medals
with three months of training.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.637
Ju Ga-ram, he's all mine.

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:40.016
Geez.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:47.899
THE WINNING TRY

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.613
EPISODE 4

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:57.408
Now, we will begin the 2025

00:01:57.492 --> 00:01:58.618
second semester's--

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:00.120
Hold on!

00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:17.554
Our player is here.

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:20.098
- He's here.
- He's here.

00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:21.349
- He came.
- What?

00:02:21.432 --> 00:02:22.642
RUGBY TEAM

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.867
Darn it.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:49.878
We have a player.

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:14.944
There has been a change
in the special admission process

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:16.404
starting this semester.

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.205
<i>Each team will hold a tryout.</i>

00:03:27.498 --> 00:03:30.919
Any coach who wants an athlete
can participate.

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:34.505
From there, he has to pass
at least half of the tryouts.

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:39.344
Then he'll be admitted to the school
and have a chance to choose a team

00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:41.512
among the events he has passed.

00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:47.644
We changed the process five years ago
because no one could get in this way.

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:49.145
Someone did get in.

00:03:58.154 --> 00:04:00.406
It's an order
from the Office of Education.

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:05.453
He can't get admitted to the school
if he doesn't want to try out.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:15.255
SPECIAL ADMISSION TRYOUTS

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:17.340
- Look.
- Hey, Rugby.

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:20.677
MUN UNG: 1ST-YEAR
RUGBY, FENCING, ARCHERY

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.179
The Rugby Team is done for.

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:24.889
Shouldn't they just give up?

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:26.015
- True.
- Right?

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.977
- Are you out of your minds?
- Do you want another beating?

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:31.938
Man.

00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:35.733
CATEGORY: RUGBY, FENCING, ARCHERY

00:04:39.153 --> 00:04:41.072
Geez.

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:44.534
Has he ever played sports before, Coach?

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:46.953
Not professionally, I assume.

00:04:47.036 --> 00:04:49.330
His body is so perfect, though.

00:04:50.581 --> 00:04:52.125
Exactly.

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:56.921
He's 183 cm, weighs 78 kg,
and runs 100m in the high 11s.

00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:59.674
We have yet to check his big three lifts.

00:04:59.757 --> 00:05:04.387
But he has strong shoulders and arms
from making deliveries for years.

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:09.225
See how it bounces my fingers off?
He has great core strength too.

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:14.897
- We're not that different.
- Let's say we let him win in rugby,

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.858
but fencing and archery
are technical sports.

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:20.320
We will find a way.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.157
Ga-ram might try to outsmart us,

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.827
so we picked the hardest events
among the technical sports.

00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:29.620
Good.

00:05:29.704 --> 00:05:33.750
A natural can sometimes
pull a miracle in basic sports,

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:36.210
like when a newbie beats a professional.

00:05:37.086 --> 00:05:39.672
Still, don't let your guard down
and be prepared.

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:40.923
- Okay.
- Yes.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:43.676
May I ask why you excluded shooting?

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.721
Of the technical sports,
shooting is the most difficult one.

00:05:49.348 --> 00:05:53.227
Is it going to be all right?
Ms. Kang seemed very angry.

00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:57.398
I'll take care of her myself.

00:05:58.149 --> 00:05:59.942
Take care of what?

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:02.528
You can get going.

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:03.821
- Okay.
- Yes.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.202
What are you trying to pull?

00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:11.079
You even brought
the Office of Education in.

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:15.875
Please consider it the first step
in the school's development.

00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.960
Is this development for the students?

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:19.796
Or is it for you?

00:06:22.381 --> 00:06:24.592
I understand how you feel.

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:27.720
You want to take care
of every single student.

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:31.808
But of the school's graduates,

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:35.895
less than 10% have become
professional athletes.

00:06:35.978 --> 00:06:37.814
Those who don't make it as pros

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:41.359
try to become PE teachers
by going to college,

00:06:41.442 --> 00:06:42.860
but that's not easy, either.

00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:45.446
Maybe 5% succeed at best.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.409
Then do you know
what the remaining 85% are doing

00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:52.286
to make a living?

00:06:53.955 --> 00:06:55.623
I heard someone say

00:06:56.624 --> 00:07:00.878
that half of the club bouncers in Gangnam
are from PE high schools.

00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:02.046
Vice Principal!

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.172
Am I being too blunt?

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:07.260
Isn't it the cruel reality
we want to ignore?

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:10.888
What does it mean to be a good teacher?

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:14.934
Someone who inspires hopes and dreams
saying, "Do whatever you want to do"?

00:07:15.017 --> 00:07:18.146
Or someone who helps students identify

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:20.815
which paths
are actually feasible for them?

00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:23.359
A school,

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:24.819
especially a PE high school,

00:07:25.486 --> 00:07:28.322
isn't some fantasy land
for finding dreams.

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:31.701
School is where athletes
learn to face reality.

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:34.287
This is a vocational school.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.333
Your romantic idea…

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.545
is an unrealistic fantasy.

00:07:43.754 --> 00:07:44.964
Dream all you want,

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:47.800
but don't drag the students into it.

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:23.252
- Did you hear everything?
- The school isn't soundproofed well.

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:30.384
Geez.

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:34.597
Why are you so down?

00:08:35.556 --> 00:08:37.433
Because what the vice principal said…

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:40.728
isn't totally wrong.

00:08:42.813 --> 00:08:47.485
The teams he wants to disband don't have
enough professional teams to advance to,

00:08:47.568 --> 00:08:50.071
and the colleges have limited quotas.

00:08:50.154 --> 00:08:52.782
True. Even in rugby,

00:08:53.407 --> 00:08:56.536
there are only a handful
of professional teams.

00:08:59.747 --> 00:09:01.082
How many of these students

00:09:01.165 --> 00:09:04.335
will be able to become
professional athletes?

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:14.679
Was I never a good teacher?

00:09:18.182 --> 00:09:19.225
Should I…

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.478
have been more cold-hearted?

00:09:25.856 --> 00:09:26.732
Ms. Kang.

00:09:27.358 --> 00:09:30.570
Do you remember that…

00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:31.988
that thing?

00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:33.072
What?

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:38.411
I didn't start playing rugby
to become an athlete.

00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:40.997
<i>Ju Ga-ram.</i>

00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:45.209
Take a seat.

00:09:46.377 --> 00:09:49.589
Have you made up your mind?
The track and field coach wants you.

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:51.424
He did.

00:09:52.633 --> 00:09:53.884
But…

00:09:58.556 --> 00:09:59.640
How about rugby?

00:10:01.225 --> 00:10:02.101
Rugby?

00:10:02.184 --> 00:10:07.648
In rugby, you can't pass forward.
You can only pass to the side or backward.

00:10:08.482 --> 00:10:09.900
In other words,

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:13.696
someone has to protect your side
at all times.

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:16.574
It looks tough on the outside,

00:10:16.657 --> 00:10:19.785
but in fact, it's the kindest sport.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:22.663
You won't be lonely.

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:33.090
<i>It was 17-year-old Ju Ga-ram</i>
<i>who chose to play rugby.</i>

00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:37.011
You and Mr. Seong seem to think

00:10:37.845 --> 00:10:41.891
you're responsible
for the students' futures.

00:10:46.854 --> 00:10:49.815
They run and roll on the ground

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.484
because they choose to do so.

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:01.327
Ms. Kang.

00:11:02.995 --> 00:11:03.913
Give them a chance

00:11:03.996 --> 00:11:07.458
to decide their lives for themselves.

00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:23.140
HANYANG RUGBY

00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:29.355
Higher.

00:11:31.774 --> 00:11:32.817
Ju-yang, go higher.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:33.859
More?

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:35.361
Stop.

00:11:35.444 --> 00:11:38.406
Now.

00:11:38.489 --> 00:11:40.449
- Look at the protractor.
- You're here, Coach.

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:42.284
- Coach.
- Already hazing the new guy?

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:43.619
It's not just a hazing.

00:11:43.702 --> 00:11:45.746
They say flexibility is key in fencing.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:46.664
Right.

00:11:46.747 --> 00:11:48.290
Save me, Coach.

00:11:48.874 --> 00:11:50.000
Help me.

00:11:50.084 --> 00:11:52.086
Coach.

00:11:55.047 --> 00:11:56.006
DAY 1, DAY 2, DAY 3

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:57.341
Break time.

00:11:58.175 --> 00:11:59.301
Geez. This is hard.

00:11:59.885 --> 00:12:00.970
Okay. Moving on.

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:03.305
The next step. Let's go.

00:12:04.473 --> 00:12:06.016
Now, we use this…

00:12:06.767 --> 00:12:07.643
Breathe.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.314
VINEGAR

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:13.607
Why the vinegar?

00:12:14.191 --> 00:12:15.609
It's good for flexibility.

00:12:15.693 --> 00:12:18.154
Open up.

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:20.614
It looks tasty.

00:12:22.658 --> 00:12:24.702
- Did you guys plan this out?
- Yes.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:29.039
He'll only have a chance
if he sticks to a tight schedule.

00:12:29.623 --> 00:12:30.875
It looks good.

00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.877
- Are you serious?
- Yes. It's great.

00:12:35.045 --> 00:12:37.506
But one thing. Let's see.

00:12:40.634 --> 00:12:41.927
Just a second.

00:12:45.848 --> 00:12:48.476
Give him some time to eat.

00:12:49.393 --> 00:12:50.311
For three hours?

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.523
Make sure he gets more sleep
so he doesn't get injured.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.526
Then it's perfect.

00:12:59.278 --> 00:13:01.280
Isn't it too loose?

00:13:01.363 --> 00:13:02.490
What if he loses?

00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:05.868
Our strengths are clear.

00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:09.121
We just need to find out
their weaknesses now.

00:13:22.426 --> 00:13:23.344
That's good.

00:13:56.377 --> 00:13:58.087
What are you doing? Isn't it hot?

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:01.215
Darn it.

00:14:02.091 --> 00:14:03.801
You'll hurt yourself.

00:14:03.884 --> 00:14:06.053
Geez. I'm so sick of this.

00:14:08.138 --> 00:14:09.723
Are you really going to do it, Captain?

00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:11.976
Yes. I guess I am.

00:14:12.059 --> 00:14:14.895
Is that even necessary?
Even a first-year could beat him.

00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:17.398
Coach said I have to crush him
without losing a point.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.568
- For real?
- Of course. You're Park Il-hwan.

00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:22.736
The result is obvious.
Isn't it a waste of time?

00:14:24.238 --> 00:14:26.073
Geez. You splashed everywhere.

00:14:26.156 --> 00:14:30.160
Kids these days can't even aim.
For goodness' sake.

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:35.624
Park Il-hwan.

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:47.678
<i>Prets</i>. <i>Allez.</i>

00:15:08.282 --> 00:15:09.199
Coach.

00:15:09.867 --> 00:15:11.493
- Could you please take a look?
- Sure.

00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:21.879
Who are you?

00:15:31.972 --> 00:15:32.973
En garde!

00:15:35.809 --> 00:15:36.644
What?

00:15:41.023 --> 00:15:42.733
Where did you get these?

00:15:42.816 --> 00:15:44.777
They all belong to Park Il-hwan.

00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:48.614
Il-hwan is our opponent.

00:15:48.697 --> 00:15:49.573
Geez.

00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:53.285
- He's the fencing captain.
- Aren't they taking it too far?

00:15:53.369 --> 00:15:55.204
How could they play their ace?

00:15:55.287 --> 00:15:58.540
When did they ever play fair?

00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:00.084
You two.

00:16:00.167 --> 00:16:03.295
Can you summarize his weaknesses
with the training log?

00:16:03.379 --> 00:16:04.838
Yes, we can.

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:07.800
How's Ung's basic training going?

00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:13.889
EN GARDE, MARCHE, ROMPRE, FENTE

00:16:17.226 --> 00:16:19.228
Wait. How can he do that in one day?

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.897
It's thanks to my superb plan.

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:24.733
Even though he's a fast learner,
there's a limit.

00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:26.777
Especially against Il-hwan,

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:27.987
he has zero chance.

00:16:28.862 --> 00:16:30.322
And there's archery too.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:36.120
If you keep going without giving up,
you'll find a way.

00:16:36.203 --> 00:16:37.788
Don't you know the rugby spirit?

00:16:41.625 --> 00:16:43.002
<i>Fente.</i>

00:16:43.085 --> 00:16:44.461
Good.

00:16:44.962 --> 00:16:47.548
I heard Ga-ram
is poking around the school.

00:16:47.631 --> 00:16:52.386
Yes, especially around the Fencing Team
and the Archery Team.

00:16:52.469 --> 00:16:54.680
One bad apple can spoil the barrel.

00:16:54.763 --> 00:16:56.640
Pay attention

00:16:56.724 --> 00:17:00.185
so that other teams won't be carried away
by Ga-ram and his team.

00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:01.979
Okay.

00:17:02.062 --> 00:17:04.523
Vice Principal, may I say something?

00:17:05.899 --> 00:17:06.817
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:12.156
The Rugby Team's budget isn't that small.

00:17:12.239 --> 00:17:14.658
When the team disbands,

00:17:14.742 --> 00:17:17.703
we can put the remaining budget
to good use.

00:17:17.786 --> 00:17:22.541
The coaches who cooperate well
will have their contracts renewed--

00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:24.710
- Coach Jeon.
- Yes.

00:17:25.294 --> 00:17:27.379
We'll talk about that later.

00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:28.505
Sure.

00:17:31.258 --> 00:17:33.635
- Let's do this.
- Yes.

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:34.887
You are dismissed.

00:17:35.554 --> 00:17:36.555
Thank you.

00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:40.392
Shooting Team, please stay.

00:17:43.479 --> 00:17:44.396
Please sit, Coach Bae.

00:18:02.289 --> 00:18:03.540
It's a coaching contract.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.294
I see that you had signed
a short-term contract every year.

00:18:08.212 --> 00:18:10.130
When I become the principal next year,

00:18:10.214 --> 00:18:12.382
I'd like to offer you
a three-year contract.

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:14.885
What do you say?

00:18:15.636 --> 00:18:16.929
I'd appreciate that.

00:18:17.012 --> 00:18:20.432
You do understand
that a coach's job includes

00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:22.643
administrative tasks as well as teaching?

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:24.144
Yes, I do.

00:18:24.228 --> 00:18:27.564
I plan to give you some tasks

00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:28.982
such as…

00:18:30.484 --> 00:18:33.821
keeping an eye on Coach Ju
and seeing what he's up to.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.577
I heard you two have been close
for a long time.

00:18:43.747 --> 00:18:45.040
Can you do it?

00:18:50.212 --> 00:18:54.258
HANYANG HIGH
FIXED-TERM EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT

00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:29.918
- That's…
- Geez.

00:19:31.044 --> 00:19:32.212
Where did it go?

00:19:38.093 --> 00:19:39.052
My hopes were too high.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.015
- A few days ago…
- It's his first time.

00:19:43.807 --> 00:19:46.393
It's all right.

00:19:48.729 --> 00:19:51.023
Let's find someone to teach him.

00:19:51.106 --> 00:19:53.025
We just need someone
with archery experience.

00:19:53.108 --> 00:19:54.818
It can be the guy next door
for all I care.

00:19:54.902 --> 00:19:57.571
It could be your middle
or elementary school friends,

00:19:57.654 --> 00:19:59.364
pull all the strings you have--

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:03.994
I…

00:20:04.661 --> 00:20:05.495
know someone.

00:20:14.713 --> 00:20:15.672
Sorry.

00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:17.341
It was 9.7 at 11 o'clock.

00:20:17.424 --> 00:20:19.426
You seem distracted,
so I'll check it myself.

00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:29.478
It's 10.4. That was good.

00:20:34.775 --> 00:20:37.402
COACH JEON NAK-GYUN

00:20:38.153 --> 00:20:40.280
- Yes, Coach.
- <i>Hey, I-ji.</i>

00:20:40.364 --> 00:20:42.491
Come pick me up. I'm drunk.

00:20:42.574 --> 00:20:43.867
Right, it's…

00:20:43.951 --> 00:20:46.745
<i>the skewer place I'm always at.</i>

00:20:46.828 --> 00:20:47.663
<i>Hurry.</i>

00:20:48.664 --> 00:20:52.668
Coach, U-jin is training right now,
so I can't leave the shooting range.

00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:55.420
You are of no help to her.

00:20:55.504 --> 00:20:57.839
You'd only distract her.
Hurry and come here.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.431
<i>The number you've dialed…</i>

00:21:06.515 --> 00:21:07.891
You can go.

00:21:09.351 --> 00:21:11.436
I focus better alone.

00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:14.940
Don't overdo it.

00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:19.152
Wrap it up soon.

00:21:19.236 --> 00:21:20.320
Okay.

00:21:36.378 --> 00:21:37.212
What was that?

00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:43.719
- Why'd you do that?
- Sorry.

00:21:44.511 --> 00:21:46.346
But can you do it?

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:47.431
I have to try.

00:21:47.514 --> 00:21:50.309
I'll persuade U-jin by any means.

00:21:50.392 --> 00:21:51.310
Coach,

00:21:51.393 --> 00:21:52.644
you stop Coach Bae.

00:21:57.024 --> 00:21:58.233
Slowly!

00:22:29.306 --> 00:22:31.183
Outsiders aren't allowed in.

00:22:38.231 --> 00:22:39.357
What is it?

00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:43.278
Just say it.
It's probably nonsense anyway.

00:22:43.361 --> 00:22:44.488
Well…

00:22:46.406 --> 00:22:48.241
Hello. I'm Mun Ung.

00:22:49.576 --> 00:22:50.786
Nice to meet you.

00:22:51.328 --> 00:22:56.917
What does the Rugby Team's rookie
want with the shooting captain?

00:22:58.043 --> 00:23:00.962
Actually…

00:23:08.804 --> 00:23:12.057
I quit archery four years ago,
and I don't remember a thing.

00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:15.393
Even if I do, why do I have to help you?

00:23:16.436 --> 00:23:17.896
Do you remember

00:23:17.979 --> 00:23:20.607
that we sat together
on the first day of elementary school?

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.567
When you didn't bring your supplies,

00:23:23.235 --> 00:23:25.904
I lent them to you, got scolded
by the teacher, and my mom--

00:23:25.987 --> 00:23:27.531
That won't do it.

00:23:31.034 --> 00:23:33.245
Would you please help me?

00:23:33.328 --> 00:23:36.832
I really want to play rugby.

00:23:39.417 --> 00:23:43.380
Well, you're definitely born
to be an athlete.

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:44.965
Right?

00:23:45.048 --> 00:23:47.926
He's so talented and full of passion.

00:23:48.009 --> 00:23:49.136
How can you not help?

00:23:49.636 --> 00:23:53.348
As an athlete in a different sport,
you shouldn't do that.

00:23:53.431 --> 00:23:55.225
I don't have enough time
for my own training.

00:23:56.852 --> 00:24:00.147
I don't care about passion or talents
in other sports.

00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:10.157
Seok-jun.

00:24:12.325 --> 00:24:15.662
I'm going to tell people
you had a crush on him.

00:24:16.413 --> 00:24:17.998
Will you stop the nonsense and go away?

00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:36.099
Can't you help me just this once? Please.

00:24:36.183 --> 00:24:38.602
I'll do anything. Okay?

00:24:38.685 --> 00:24:40.812
I'll really do anything.

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.291
Just once after the training.

00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:06.671
- Take it or leave it.
- Yes, that sounds good.

00:25:07.672 --> 00:25:08.506
Right?

00:25:09.257 --> 00:25:10.926
- Your answer?
- Yes.

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:24.981
Have you carefully read the contract
Mr. Seong gave you?

00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:27.901
As a coaching contract,

00:25:28.985 --> 00:25:31.154
three years is an amazing offer.
You should sign it.

00:25:32.072 --> 00:25:36.826
You have to think carefully.

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:41.081
You can't be a player-coach
for a long time.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.585
Are you listening?
I thought you were wearing earplugs.

00:25:47.128 --> 00:25:50.882
Are you participating in the tournaments
in the second half again?

00:25:51.716 --> 00:25:53.343
Yes, I am.

00:25:53.426 --> 00:25:55.345
I-ji. You…

00:25:56.846 --> 00:25:59.391
You really have to make a decision now.

00:25:59.474 --> 00:26:01.768
This is your life, isn't it?

00:26:01.851 --> 00:26:02.978
Let's be honest.

00:26:03.061 --> 00:26:04.854
As a player,

00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:09.359
you're beyond decline. You're done.

00:26:10.402 --> 00:26:11.361
What? Why?

00:26:11.444 --> 00:26:13.780
This son of a bitch
keeps blocking my path.

00:26:14.489 --> 00:26:17.075
What? Who did you honk at?

00:26:17.158 --> 00:26:19.536
Since it's late, it's hard to drive.

00:26:19.619 --> 00:26:20.662
I'll focus now.

00:26:24.708 --> 00:26:26.042
TTOBONGEE CHICKEN

00:26:26.126 --> 00:26:27.836
I ended up like this

00:26:29.045 --> 00:26:30.463
all because of Ga-ram.

00:26:30.547 --> 00:26:31.923
I know.

00:26:32.007 --> 00:26:35.218
If he hadn't caused a problem,
I wouldn't have given up on my tryout.

00:26:35.302 --> 00:26:36.553
Of course.

00:26:36.636 --> 00:26:39.431
Then I'd be in Team Korea
playing in the World Championship.

00:26:39.514 --> 00:26:41.099
With my condition back then, a medal?

00:26:41.182 --> 00:26:42.600
I could have won one easily.

00:26:43.184 --> 00:26:45.645
- Definitely.
- Then he dares to show up again?

00:26:46.479 --> 00:26:49.024
And put me in this shitty situation?

00:26:49.649 --> 00:26:50.859
What?

00:26:50.942 --> 00:26:53.862
That one's new. What happened?

00:26:54.487 --> 00:26:56.448
I was offered a renewal contract,

00:26:57.115 --> 00:26:58.992
already signed by the vice principal.

00:26:59.075 --> 00:27:00.744
If I sign it, it's a done deal.

00:27:00.827 --> 00:27:03.038
That's good news.

00:27:03.121 --> 00:27:04.748
You were worried about next year.

00:27:05.332 --> 00:27:06.958
Let's party. It's on me.

00:27:08.043 --> 00:27:11.588
Bong-bong, let's have
the soy chicken feet with chilis.

00:27:12.172 --> 00:27:13.673
Throw lots of chilis in.

00:27:14.716 --> 00:27:15.759
Okay?

00:27:15.842 --> 00:27:20.347
The problem is Ga-ram has to leave
for me to stay in the school.

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:24.100
What does Ga-ram leaving have to do

00:27:25.018 --> 00:27:26.144
with your contract?

00:27:28.688 --> 00:27:29.731
I don't know.

00:27:30.482 --> 00:27:32.025
Ga-ram is making me

00:27:32.108 --> 00:27:35.445
into someone who looks for
others' weaknesses just to attack them.

00:27:35.528 --> 00:27:39.240
When an athlete finds others' weaknesses
and attacks them,

00:27:39.324 --> 00:27:42.577
they're being smart, not nasty.

00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:45.497
Geez. Ga-ram is no stranger, is he?

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:48.249
- Shut up, traitor.
- Traitor…

00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:51.086
Are you happy to play rugby
by Ga-ram's side? Are you?

00:27:52.087 --> 00:27:53.922
While we're at it, listen, I-ji.

00:27:54.005 --> 00:27:58.009
Ga-ram might have an issue
he can't talk about.

00:27:58.093 --> 00:27:59.761
Sometimes in life,

00:27:59.844 --> 00:28:02.597
- an uncontrollable issue--
- Uncontrollable, my ass.

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.641
Everyone has their own issue,

00:28:04.724 --> 00:28:07.102
but not everyone crosses the line.

00:28:07.185 --> 00:28:08.645
But Ga-ram crossed it.

00:28:10.188 --> 00:28:11.773
Where are the chilis?

00:28:11.856 --> 00:28:14.818
Are you being thrifty?
Go and slice some more.

00:28:25.745 --> 00:28:29.958
<i>The sweat we shed</i>

00:28:30.041 --> 00:28:33.878
<i>Fills up the Hangang River</i>

00:28:34.921 --> 00:28:38.842
<i>The chant we shout together</i>

00:28:38.925 --> 00:28:42.178
<i>Wakes up our passion</i>

00:28:43.388 --> 00:28:46.474
<i>Raise your torch</i>

00:28:46.975 --> 00:28:50.937
<i>Until the new day breaks</i>

00:28:52.772 --> 00:28:56.609
<i>We run toward the golden sky</i>

00:29:08.663 --> 00:29:10.874
Was it always this bright?
It's always this bright.

00:29:11.666 --> 00:29:13.042
Quiet. Do you want to get busted?

00:29:14.294 --> 00:29:15.503
You stand over here.

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:27.932
Hold the grip with your left hand.
Spread your legs shoulder-width apart.

00:29:28.892 --> 00:29:29.976
Place your feet parallel.

00:29:30.059 --> 00:29:31.728
Place the bow on your foot.

00:29:31.811 --> 00:29:35.732
<i>Mission clear. We're at the archery range.</i>
<i>How is it going over there?</i>

00:29:38.151 --> 00:29:40.320
Use your three right fingers.
Straighten your hand.

00:29:44.532 --> 00:29:45.909
You surprised me.

00:29:45.992 --> 00:29:48.244
What do you think? It was awful.

00:29:52.457 --> 00:29:54.250
Well done, though. Thanks to you…

00:29:54.334 --> 00:29:56.252
Raise your arm. Lower your shoulder.

00:30:04.552 --> 00:30:05.762
Now pull.

00:30:11.684 --> 00:30:14.854
Why did U-jin change
from archery to shooting?

00:30:14.938 --> 00:30:16.397
Well, it was because--

00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:17.816
Because it left marks on my face.

00:30:18.817 --> 00:30:20.985
- What?
- When you draw the bow,

00:30:21.069 --> 00:30:22.654
it leaves marks on your lips and chin.

00:30:23.488 --> 00:30:24.823
It might turn into wrinkles.

00:30:24.906 --> 00:30:27.033
I don't like outdoor UV rays either.

00:30:29.327 --> 00:30:30.620
How cool.

00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:32.539
Yeah, right.

00:30:32.622 --> 00:30:34.082
Straighten your right hand.

00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:37.210
Lower your chin.
Push your left arm as if there's a wall.

00:30:37.794 --> 00:30:38.920
Relax your fingers.

00:30:43.049 --> 00:30:44.175
Lower your chin.

00:30:48.346 --> 00:30:49.556
Level your elbow.

00:30:59.065 --> 00:31:00.108
Straighten your body.

00:31:31.556 --> 00:31:33.975
Geez. What's wrong with you?

00:31:34.058 --> 00:31:35.560
Hold still.

00:31:36.895 --> 00:31:39.230
Seriously. Come on!

00:31:39.814 --> 00:31:41.190
- Come here.
- No, thank you.

00:31:41.274 --> 00:31:42.692
- Give me a hug.
- No.

00:31:42.775 --> 00:31:44.027
- Come.
- Geez.

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:45.153
Coach.

00:31:50.325 --> 00:31:51.326
You're here.

00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:53.161
What are you, kids?

00:31:53.745 --> 00:31:56.414
- What is this?
- Our strategy.

00:32:20.021 --> 00:32:20.939
Coach,

00:32:21.606 --> 00:32:25.526
what do sprinklers at night
have to do with archery?

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:27.111
They'll make the arrows shake.

00:32:28.279 --> 00:32:29.906
Creating variables.

00:32:30.907 --> 00:32:32.158
Nice plan.

00:32:33.159 --> 00:32:34.535
What variables?

00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:37.789
The Archery Team trains to handle
environmental factors

00:32:38.373 --> 00:32:39.791
<i>such as wind or rain.</i>

00:32:39.874 --> 00:32:40.959
Shoot.

00:32:45.213 --> 00:32:46.422
Relax your shoulders.

00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:52.011
Hold them straight.

00:32:52.095 --> 00:32:54.263
Does rain ever soar upward
from the ground?

00:32:55.014 --> 00:32:57.934
<i>Rain never soars upward from the ground.</i>

00:32:59.352 --> 00:33:01.646
If he can shoot calmly
when the water soars,

00:33:01.729 --> 00:33:03.564
he'll be a step ahead of them.

00:33:03.648 --> 00:33:06.818
The variable called water
will reduce the technical differences.

00:33:06.901 --> 00:33:11.030
In that case,
it becomes a competition of physicality.

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:43.271
He got it.

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:47.400
He shot the target.

00:33:53.781 --> 00:33:54.782
MOM

00:33:58.119 --> 00:33:59.579
Hey, U-jin.

00:34:00.163 --> 00:34:01.748
U-jin, please keep…

00:34:01.831 --> 00:34:03.082
our secret.

00:34:05.585 --> 00:34:06.919
SPECIAL ADMISSION TRYOUTS DAY

00:34:07.003 --> 00:34:08.713
<i>Okay. Good luck.</i>

00:34:10.798 --> 00:34:11.966
You can do it.

00:34:17.513 --> 00:34:18.347
Hello.

00:34:21.225 --> 00:34:22.769
I guess you're well prepared.

00:34:23.811 --> 00:34:24.896
Well, yes.

00:34:27.148 --> 00:34:28.357
Let's do this.

00:34:29.817 --> 00:34:31.069
I wonder what your strategy is.

00:34:44.624 --> 00:34:45.625
Rugby!

00:34:46.375 --> 00:34:47.668
Let's go!

00:34:52.298 --> 00:34:53.841
Break our defense.

00:34:53.925 --> 00:34:55.176
Do you see the line over there?

00:34:55.259 --> 00:34:57.929
Just touch the ball on the ground
past the line.

00:34:58.012 --> 00:34:59.514
- Can you do it?
- Yes.

00:34:59.597 --> 00:35:00.765
Don't be nervous.

00:35:00.848 --> 00:35:01.724
- Okay?
- Okay.

00:35:02.308 --> 00:35:03.935
- Good luck.
- Let's get started.

00:35:04.018 --> 00:35:05.144
Let's do this.

00:35:08.314 --> 00:35:10.525
- Okay. Let's do this.
- Let's go, Ung.

00:35:11.776 --> 00:35:13.236
Go for it!

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:02.034
Didn't Seong-jun really fall
for the first feint?

00:36:02.118 --> 00:36:03.202
Is he really a newbie?

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.882
ROUND 1
RUGBY: WIN

00:36:21.971 --> 00:36:25.016
Il-hwan will make a quick dash
when he spots a chance.

00:36:25.099 --> 00:36:28.269
Look at his feet. Increase the gap
to make him feel rushed.

00:36:28.352 --> 00:36:29.937
That's when you strike, okay?

00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:31.314
Okay.

00:36:33.816 --> 00:36:34.901
He's ready.

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:48.706
You know the rules?

00:36:49.498 --> 00:36:52.043
Three bouts, three minutes each.

00:36:52.126 --> 00:36:54.962
The match is over
when one scores 15 points.

00:36:55.046 --> 00:36:57.965
- You can attack the whole body.
- Okay.

00:37:02.929 --> 00:37:04.096
- You have to win.
- Breathe.

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:05.681
- Let's play rugby!
- You can do it.

00:37:05.765 --> 00:37:07.433
Good. You're doing good.

00:37:09.268 --> 00:37:11.270
Salute. En garde.

00:37:13.564 --> 00:37:14.774
<i>Prets. Allez.</i>

00:37:17.151 --> 00:37:19.153
- He scored.
- Nice.

00:37:19.237 --> 00:37:20.154
<i>Halte!</i>

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:25.576
- It's okay.
- It's just a point.

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.328
- It's all right.
- Go!

00:37:27.411 --> 00:37:28.996
Take it slow. Relax.

00:37:31.457 --> 00:37:33.417
It's all right.
Remember what you've practiced.

00:37:34.502 --> 00:37:35.878
En garde.

00:37:35.962 --> 00:37:37.755
<i>Prets. Allez.</i>

00:37:40.466 --> 00:37:43.719
Push him. Close the distance.

00:37:43.803 --> 00:37:46.389
- Go forward.
- Let's go forward.

00:37:52.103 --> 00:37:53.562
It's all right.

00:37:56.315 --> 00:37:57.149
<i>Allez.</i>

00:37:58.985 --> 00:38:00.319
Thrust.

00:38:04.657 --> 00:38:06.075
Press him.

00:38:19.297 --> 00:38:20.131
<i>Allez.</i>

00:38:33.811 --> 00:38:35.229
- What?
- What's he doing?

00:38:35.313 --> 00:38:37.732
I understand. He's cute.

00:38:38.733 --> 00:38:41.277
He's dragging by keeping a distance.
We only have a few seconds.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:44.155
Boo! Hey, Il-hwan!
Don't you have pride as a fencer?

00:38:44.989 --> 00:38:46.949
Hey, sit.

00:38:47.033 --> 00:38:48.951
- What are you going to do about it?
- Boo!

00:38:49.035 --> 00:38:49.994
Why do we have to sit?

00:38:50.077 --> 00:38:52.163
He's cutting him some slack
because he's bad.

00:38:52.246 --> 00:38:53.831
- So what?
- Hey.

00:39:18.522 --> 00:39:20.691
Ung, it's okay.

00:39:20.775 --> 00:39:22.526
- It's okay.
- You're doing good.

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:23.694
Good job.

00:39:23.778 --> 00:39:25.071
It's okay. You're doing fine.

00:39:25.905 --> 00:39:26.739
Here.

00:39:29.825 --> 00:39:31.577
- I saw it.
- What?

00:39:34.413 --> 00:39:35.414
His sword.

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:37.208
I can see it now.

00:39:41.754 --> 00:39:44.840
I promise that I'll score
at least one point.

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.638
En garde.

00:39:50.721 --> 00:39:52.139
<i>Prets. Allez.</i>

00:40:02.316 --> 00:40:03.609
- He scored!
- Nice.

00:40:03.692 --> 00:40:05.903
- Is he going to score?
- Can he?

00:40:05.986 --> 00:40:07.154
How is this possible?

00:40:21.877 --> 00:40:23.087
What?

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:24.046
What's going on?

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:25.631
The light didn't turn on.

00:40:36.016 --> 00:40:37.268
What in the world?

00:40:40.813 --> 00:40:44.942
ROUND 2
FENCING: LOSE

00:40:46.485 --> 00:40:47.361
Please.

00:40:47.445 --> 00:40:50.448
It's not like he won a gold medal.

00:40:53.576 --> 00:40:56.412
- Good job.
- Ung, well done.

00:40:56.495 --> 00:40:59.039
- You're so cool.
- You did awesome.

00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:00.916
Hey. The game isn't over yet.

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:05.754
I'm sorry.

00:41:05.838 --> 00:41:08.841
Don't be. You did a great job.

00:41:08.924 --> 00:41:13.637
Strength and focus until the end,
without giving up.

00:41:13.721 --> 00:41:15.681
That was great. Good job.

00:41:16.432 --> 00:41:18.225
The real match begins now.

00:41:18.893 --> 00:41:22.021
Just remember
what we trained yesterday, Ung.

00:41:22.104 --> 00:41:23.481
Then you can surely win it.

00:41:25.441 --> 00:41:27.401
Is he gifted or what?

00:41:27.485 --> 00:41:29.153
He should do fencing, not rugby.

00:41:29.236 --> 00:41:32.072
- He still lost, though.
- It's wild he scored against Il-hwan.

00:41:32.156 --> 00:41:34.158
He's a National Sports Festival
silver medalist.

00:41:34.241 --> 00:41:36.619
At this pace,
he might win the archery match.

00:41:36.702 --> 00:41:38.454
- He actually might.
- Seriously.

00:41:38.537 --> 00:41:42.374
FINAL ROUND

00:41:43.792 --> 00:41:44.668
What now?

00:41:45.669 --> 00:41:47.963
- I've created variables.
- What?

00:41:48.756 --> 00:41:51.342
Archery is all about the variables,
isn't it?

00:41:55.679 --> 00:41:56.972
I don't see the archery coach.

00:41:57.056 --> 00:41:57.890
- What?
- I think?

00:41:57.973 --> 00:41:59.725
The archers aren't here, either.

00:42:00.768 --> 00:42:02.311
What? Why aren't they here?

00:42:08.692 --> 00:42:09.652
Hold on.

00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:14.365
Wait.

00:42:23.707 --> 00:42:26.835
We'll cancel today's archery match.

00:42:31.674 --> 00:42:33.509
Wait, why?

00:42:33.592 --> 00:42:36.554
The whole team got food poisoning.

00:42:38.931 --> 00:42:39.807
Oh, no.

00:42:40.391 --> 00:42:43.519
We can't help but have another match.

00:42:43.602 --> 00:42:47.273
Then we'll discuss
which sport he'll try out for first--

00:42:47.356 --> 00:42:48.857
We can play by the rules.

00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:54.446
Is there any team that wants a player?

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:55.614
We do.

00:42:56.198 --> 00:42:57.866
We, the Shooting Team, will participate.

00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:58.784
What?

00:43:01.453 --> 00:43:02.955
We have the Shooting Team.

00:43:04.123 --> 00:43:06.375
Is there any other team who wants him?

00:43:15.426 --> 00:43:16.719
I guess not.

00:43:17.386 --> 00:43:21.307
Then the shooting tryout will decide
his admission.

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:22.766
This is foul play.

00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:25.060
How can he play such a technical sport
without training?

00:43:25.936 --> 00:43:26.979
Will one hour be enough?

00:43:28.147 --> 00:43:29.898
- Vice Principal.
- We can't help it.

00:43:29.982 --> 00:43:31.650
That's the rule.

00:43:32.484 --> 00:43:35.487
We can't wait
until the whole Archery Team recovers.

00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:38.574
Or…

00:43:40.784 --> 00:43:41.702
will you…

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.788
just withdraw?

00:44:07.853 --> 00:44:08.771
Hey, U-jin.

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:18.072
- Was it you?
- What?

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:20.324
Did you tell them?

00:44:21.617 --> 00:44:22.701
<i>U-jin.</i>

00:44:22.785 --> 00:44:23.786
THREE HOURS AGO

00:44:23.869 --> 00:44:24.912
Yes?

00:44:24.995 --> 00:44:26.455
There will be a tryout later.

00:44:26.538 --> 00:44:27.581
You do it.

00:44:27.665 --> 00:44:28.999
- A tryout?
- Yes.

00:44:29.083 --> 00:44:32.086
You know, the special admission
for the new kid Ga-ram brought in.

00:44:32.169 --> 00:44:35.214
Wasn't it decided as fencing and archery?

00:44:35.297 --> 00:44:38.801
No need to worry about the details.
Show us your best.

00:44:39.468 --> 00:44:40.886
What are you going to do about it?

00:44:45.057 --> 00:44:47.184
- I'm competing against him too.
- What?

00:44:49.603 --> 00:44:51.021
Please lose, just this once.

00:44:54.817 --> 00:44:55.692
Why should I?

00:44:56.693 --> 00:44:58.070
Could you just help us?

00:44:58.987 --> 00:45:00.906
Winning won't do you any good.

00:45:00.989 --> 00:45:02.408
Why not?

00:45:03.158 --> 00:45:06.412
They'll upgrade our whole facility
once your team is gone.

00:45:08.497 --> 00:45:09.873
You're so mean.

00:45:11.375 --> 00:45:14.670
- Why do you have to be so selfish?
- What are you, a child?

00:45:19.758 --> 00:45:20.592
Stop whining.

00:45:24.179 --> 00:45:26.056
I want to play rugby.

00:45:29.852 --> 00:45:32.771
Let me live my life
as rugby player, Yoon Seong-jun,

00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:37.943
not just as soccer player
Yoon Seok-jun's twin brother.

00:45:45.367 --> 00:45:48.078
I wouldn't have time for this
if I were you.

00:45:48.162 --> 00:45:50.164
- Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
- What?

00:45:50.247 --> 00:45:52.875
Aren't you ashamed
to pull such a cheap trick

00:45:52.958 --> 00:45:54.251
on the students?

00:45:54.334 --> 00:45:55.627
Ga-ram.

00:45:55.711 --> 00:45:56.628
Watch your mouth.

00:45:56.712 --> 00:45:59.631
Why do I need to be ashamed?

00:46:00.716 --> 00:46:03.927
I'm doing what needs to be done
for the school.

00:46:04.011 --> 00:46:06.930
And is that discouraging
high school students' dreams?

00:46:07.014 --> 00:46:09.683
Those dreams aren't free.

00:46:10.392 --> 00:46:11.935
We have a limited budget.

00:46:12.019 --> 00:46:17.441
We aren't well-off enough
to support dreams that have no potential.

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:20.194
The result is obvious.

00:46:22.237 --> 00:46:24.406
Why do you eat
when you'll poop it out anyway?

00:46:25.699 --> 00:46:28.577
Why do you want to be a principal
when you'll retire anyway?

00:46:29.369 --> 00:46:30.954
Are you kidding me?

00:46:31.038 --> 00:46:32.873
Everyone lives knowing that they'll die.

00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:35.000
Every player plays,
knowing the game will end.

00:46:35.083 --> 00:46:36.877
But only the ones

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.171
who play until the end
know the result of the game.

00:46:39.755 --> 00:46:44.968
Our job as adults is to give these kids
a chance to play until the end.

00:46:45.886 --> 00:46:47.638
It's not to push them out of the stadium

00:46:47.721 --> 00:46:51.350
while talking about their potential before
the starting whistle has even blown.

00:46:51.433 --> 00:46:53.560
Your team's match is already over.

00:46:54.895 --> 00:46:56.271
The results are out.

00:47:00.192 --> 00:47:02.528
You lost already.

00:47:03.779 --> 00:47:04.780
No.

00:47:06.031 --> 00:47:07.491
It hasn't even begun yet.

00:47:08.325 --> 00:47:09.576
You'll see.

00:47:10.327 --> 00:47:14.164
I'll show you that potential.

00:47:15.707 --> 00:47:17.668
Sure. Good luck.

00:47:18.252 --> 00:47:19.461
To do so,

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:22.589
you'll have to pass
the shooting tryout first.

00:47:36.478 --> 00:47:39.856
Okay, breathe in and raise the gun.

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:41.733
Good. Put it down.

00:47:42.484 --> 00:47:44.152
Try it again.

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:46.905
Breathing is crucial.

00:47:46.989 --> 00:47:50.450
Hold it up while breathing in.

00:47:51.118 --> 00:47:52.452
Aim.

00:47:52.995 --> 00:47:53.829
Coach.

00:47:55.956 --> 00:47:56.999
I'm sorry.

00:48:00.669 --> 00:48:03.171
I think U-jin told them
about our archery strategy.

00:48:06.258 --> 00:48:09.720
That must be why the vice principal
changed the tryout event.

00:48:16.518 --> 00:48:17.603
It's my fault.

00:48:19.855 --> 00:48:22.357
I don't think that's the case, Seong-jun.

00:48:22.441 --> 00:48:23.775
Come here.

00:48:23.859 --> 00:48:24.943
Gather around.

00:48:25.819 --> 00:48:26.903
Okay.

00:48:26.987 --> 00:48:28.530
Let's huddle.

00:48:34.953 --> 00:48:37.080
Rugby Team, smile.

00:48:37.873 --> 00:48:40.417
Come on. Smile.

00:48:41.585 --> 00:48:45.255
The Rugby Team will be fine.

00:48:45.339 --> 00:48:46.590
Because…

00:48:47.841 --> 00:48:49.551
you've got me, Ju Ga-ram.

00:48:50.218 --> 00:48:51.219
Don't give up.

00:48:52.054 --> 00:48:54.306
We will definitely win.

00:48:56.516 --> 00:48:57.476
Let's chant.

00:48:57.976 --> 00:48:58.810
Hanyang!

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:01.480
Louder!

00:49:01.563 --> 00:49:04.066
Hanyang!

00:49:04.149 --> 00:49:06.360
Hanyang!

00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:08.945
Hanyang!

00:49:09.029 --> 00:49:10.989
Hanyang!

00:49:14.034 --> 00:49:15.160
Hey, Dad!

00:49:15.243 --> 00:49:16.370
You're here.

00:49:17.746 --> 00:49:19.039
- You're here, sir.
- Dad!

00:49:19.581 --> 00:49:20.582
Hello.

00:49:20.666 --> 00:49:22.834
Scooch over and make some room.

00:49:27.756 --> 00:49:29.466
How did you make the time to come?

00:49:30.217 --> 00:49:33.970
I heard the tryout has changed
from archery to shooting.

00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:37.766
Was this your plan all along?

00:49:38.433 --> 00:49:39.267
- Yes.
- Geez.

00:49:40.227 --> 00:49:41.937
You're so meticulous.

00:49:45.273 --> 00:49:47.526
But it's not Seol-hyeon who's playing.

00:49:47.609 --> 00:49:51.113
It was too minuscule for her
to participate in a match like this,

00:49:51.196 --> 00:49:52.489
so I had U-jin do it.

00:49:59.246 --> 00:50:00.622
It must be time.

00:50:20.392 --> 00:50:21.685
Let's go.

00:50:32.779 --> 00:50:33.947
Good luck.

00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:35.991
Ung.

00:50:36.825 --> 00:50:37.826
Ung.

00:50:39.536 --> 00:50:41.121
It's okay to lose. Okay?

00:50:41.747 --> 00:50:42.789
It's okay to lose.

00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:48.170
Regardless of the outcome,
I will find a way.

00:50:48.253 --> 00:50:51.047
Just do your best. Got it?

00:50:57.679 --> 00:50:59.014
- Go, Ung!
- Let's go!

00:50:59.097 --> 00:51:01.683
- You can do it.
- You've got this.

00:51:01.767 --> 00:51:03.268
You can do it.

00:51:03.351 --> 00:51:05.061
Gosh. They are loud.

00:51:05.145 --> 00:51:06.146
Ga-ram.

00:51:09.691 --> 00:51:11.067
Have you got a plan?

00:51:11.735 --> 00:51:13.570
I'm looking for a way

00:51:13.653 --> 00:51:16.782
to get him into another school
and transfer him back here.

00:51:16.865 --> 00:51:18.617
I'll find a way no matter what.

00:51:19.493 --> 00:51:20.952
I'll never give up, Ms. Kang.

00:51:23.997 --> 00:51:25.332
Okay, silence.

00:51:29.169 --> 00:51:31.838
- Go.
- We will begin the shooting tryout,

00:51:32.506 --> 00:51:34.925
Round Three
of the special admission tryout.

00:51:35.717 --> 00:51:37.803
Mun Ung, begin shooting.

00:52:02.452 --> 00:52:04.371
- I knew it.
- He can't do it.

00:52:04.454 --> 00:52:06.081
No. It's only the first shot.

00:52:06.164 --> 00:52:07.374
It's basically zero points.

00:52:07.457 --> 00:52:08.500
He did hit the target.

00:52:11.253 --> 00:52:12.963
No, you never know.

00:52:24.683 --> 00:52:26.226
TOTAL: 3 POINTS

00:52:29.354 --> 00:52:32.148
- I told you.
- It's over.

00:52:32.232 --> 00:52:33.900
It's over.

00:52:35.777 --> 00:52:37.070
You're doing great.

00:52:37.153 --> 00:52:38.154
Go, Ung!

00:52:39.239 --> 00:52:40.490
It's not over yet.

00:52:53.044 --> 00:52:54.129
TOTAL: 5 POINTS

00:53:13.189 --> 00:53:15.025
TOTAL: 7 POINTS

00:53:15.984 --> 00:53:18.320
- It's over.
- It's over.

00:53:19.654 --> 00:53:21.323
She can outscore him by one shot.

00:53:24.159 --> 00:53:26.202
The Rugby Team is certain to be disbanded.

00:53:26.286 --> 00:53:29.247
I'll push ahead
with the reorganization plan right away,

00:53:29.331 --> 00:53:30.665
as I mentioned before.

00:53:30.749 --> 00:53:31.875
Good.

00:53:32.584 --> 00:53:35.670
I trust you to win 30 golds
in the National Sports Festival.

00:53:37.005 --> 00:53:38.006
Yes.

00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:42.010
- Good job.
- Well done.

00:53:42.093 --> 00:53:43.887
- You did well.
- Good job.

00:53:45.805 --> 00:53:46.848
You did great.

00:53:46.932 --> 00:53:48.516
Okay? Well done.

00:53:56.650 --> 00:53:57.609
Seo U-jin.

00:53:57.692 --> 00:53:58.902
Begin shooting.

00:54:01.363 --> 00:54:03.531
Focus and shoot precisely, U-jin.

00:54:04.574 --> 00:54:05.867
Do you know what I mean?

00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:08.620
Will you answer…

00:54:08.703 --> 00:54:10.997
Geez. You surprised me. What?

00:54:12.082 --> 00:54:13.458
- What?
- What?

00:54:14.084 --> 00:54:15.001
What's going on?

00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:20.173
What's going on?

00:54:22.676 --> 00:54:24.469
TOTAL: 0 POINTS

00:54:28.723 --> 00:54:29.808
Is she doing it on purpose?

00:54:43.321 --> 00:54:45.073
TOTAL: 0 POINTS

00:54:48.785 --> 00:54:49.619
Hey, Ung.

00:54:50.578 --> 00:54:52.038
Congratulations on your admission.

00:54:54.916 --> 00:54:56.710
- He won.
- He won.

00:54:56.793 --> 00:54:58.253
- He won.
- He won.

00:55:01.923 --> 00:55:04.009
ROUND 3
SHOOTING: WIN

00:55:37.083 --> 00:55:38.084
U-jin.

00:55:46.634 --> 00:55:47.719
Why did you do that?

00:55:47.802 --> 00:55:48.720
What about you?

00:55:49.304 --> 00:55:51.931
- Why did you say it was okay to lose?
- What?

00:55:53.016 --> 00:55:53.850
Well.

00:55:54.809 --> 00:55:56.186
Because it's okay to lose.

00:55:56.269 --> 00:55:58.396
It's never okay for any athlete to lose.

00:56:00.106 --> 00:56:01.483
Then why did you lose?

00:56:06.529 --> 00:56:08.239
You tell me.

00:56:09.616 --> 00:56:11.576
Because I don't know why at the moment.

00:56:17.082 --> 00:56:17.916
Hey, it's U-jin.

00:56:17.999 --> 00:56:20.085
- There's U-jin.
- I see her.

00:56:21.586 --> 00:56:22.921
Is she running away?

00:56:23.755 --> 00:56:24.798
Where are you going?

00:56:27.509 --> 00:56:28.676
Where are you going?

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:32.931
I did everything

00:56:34.015 --> 00:56:35.767
trusting your words, Mr. Seong.

00:56:36.559 --> 00:56:38.686
What is this?

00:56:40.021 --> 00:56:40.897
My apologies.

00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:42.482
I'll find a way--

00:56:43.399 --> 00:56:44.317
Forget it.

00:56:45.944 --> 00:56:49.322
There's a lot of talk at the office
about the change in the admission process.

00:56:49.405 --> 00:56:52.867
Suppose the Rugby Team doesn't achieve
good results again this year.

00:56:52.951 --> 00:56:55.328
In that case, it won't have
enough players next year,

00:56:55.411 --> 00:56:57.080
which will automatically disband it.

00:56:57.163 --> 00:56:59.582
Let's think about a soft landing.

00:57:02.001 --> 00:57:07.298
If the Rugby Team somehow wins
at this National Sports Festival--

00:57:07.382 --> 00:57:11.636
That's why you have to try harder,
so something like this won't happen again.

00:57:14.806 --> 00:57:16.391
Bye.

00:57:17.517 --> 00:57:18.726
Until next time.

00:57:21.646 --> 00:57:23.314
What happened?

00:57:24.107 --> 00:57:25.608
I'm not sure.

00:57:25.692 --> 00:57:28.236
This is driving me crazy. Darn it.

00:57:28.319 --> 00:57:30.238
By the looks of it,

00:57:30.321 --> 00:57:32.991
you two don't know what exactly happened.

00:57:33.074 --> 00:57:35.743
I'll look into why U-jin did it
right away.

00:57:36.369 --> 00:57:38.204
U-jin caused this mess.

00:57:38.288 --> 00:57:39.998
But Ga-ram must be the reason.

00:57:44.794 --> 00:57:47.088
Right, Coach Bae.

00:57:47.839 --> 00:57:48.673
Yes.

00:57:48.756 --> 00:57:51.259
I'll call off the contract deal.

00:57:51.926 --> 00:57:54.387
I can't leave my athletes to a coach

00:57:54.471 --> 00:57:56.639
who can't even fulfill a task
like this, can I?

00:57:58.641 --> 00:57:59.476
I got it.

00:58:00.935 --> 00:58:03.062
Are you going to leave without eating?

00:58:08.651 --> 00:58:12.405
<i>Fills up the Hangang River</i>

<i>The chant we shout together</i>
<i>Wakes up our passion</i>

<i>Hanyang Physical Education High School</i>

NURSE'S OFFICE

00:59:53.506 --> 00:59:56.134
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:08.062
Ga-ram.

01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:53.191
THE WINNING TRY

01:01:17.465 --> 01:01:20.343
THE WINNING TRY

01:01:20.426 --> 01:01:22.136
Rugby Team, let's practice.

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:24.222
The Track and Field Team
has the field all day.

01:01:24.305 --> 01:01:25.640
<i>We need a proper field.</i>

01:01:25.723 --> 01:01:27.058
<i>I thought we were training.</i>

01:01:27.141 --> 01:01:28.476
<i>This is training too.</i>

01:01:28.559 --> 01:01:30.311
Run as fast as you can!

01:01:30.395 --> 01:01:32.355
When you play by relying on each other,

01:01:32.438 --> 01:01:34.524
it creates synergy.

01:01:34.607 --> 01:01:36.192
Synergy.

01:01:36.275 --> 01:01:37.652
<i>We have a practice match.</i>

01:01:37.735 --> 01:01:39.028
- <i>It's against…</i>
- <i>A pro team?</i>

01:01:40.571 --> 01:01:43.533
- Say that again.
- I can't let you guys ruin my life.

01:01:43.616 --> 01:01:45.702
I have to give it my all in this tryout.

01:01:45.785 --> 01:01:47.537
<i>This is my last chance.</i>

01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:50.164
<i>A disease doesn't discriminate.</i>

01:01:50.248 --> 01:01:51.999
<i>Even a slight delay can be fatal.</i>

01:01:57.630 --> 01:01:59.632
