00:00:00.413 --> 00:00:02.757
This is where you will get the answer.

00:00:02.773 --> 00:00:04.525
Commission for what?

00:00:04.983 --> 00:00:06.853
A commission for making her disappear!

00:00:06.877 --> 00:00:10.117
She was being a snob and wearing black gloves.

00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:12.741
It wasn’t Pi.

00:00:12.983 --> 00:00:14.389
I can remember now,

00:00:15.323 --> 00:00:16.389
who it was.

00:00:29.643 --> 00:00:33.165
(Humans are not afraid of committing a sin.)

00:00:34.293 --> 00:00:35.549
After the job is done,

00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:37.613
you need to pay the rest of the fee.

00:00:39.473 --> 00:00:41.997
(But we are afraid of paying for our sin.)

00:00:44.197 --> 00:00:45.597
Chatfah.

00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:47.677
Chatfah?

00:00:53.463 --> 00:00:54.429
We've got to go.

00:00:56.153 --> 00:00:57.429
What about Pi?

00:00:57.477 --> 00:00:58.893
Someone will help her.

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:00.525
We can’t let them catch you right now.

00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:03.357
Come on.

00:01:19.353 --> 00:01:20.285
Look.

00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:23.229
In this area, this is the only place.

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:24.197
Let’s go.

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:46.021
You can’t go in.

00:01:46.943 --> 00:01:48.197
But my sister is in there.

00:01:48.213 --> 00:01:49.629
The police are working in the building.

00:01:54.213 --> 00:01:57.181
[Chat’s phone is found here.]
[I’ll go check it first.]

00:01:59.373 --> 00:02:00.517
We don’t let anyone go in.

00:02:03.313 --> 00:02:04.205
What the heck!

00:02:05.633 --> 00:02:08.189
(No matter what we have been taught.)

00:02:08.973 --> 00:02:10.245
(But in the end,)

00:02:10.613 --> 00:02:16.829
(the only thing that is passed on to us
is the survival instinct.)

00:02:23.313 --> 00:02:27.661
(That’s why we need
to stay calm and composed.)

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:28.541
Bua.

00:02:30.823 --> 00:02:31.837
Chompoo.

00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:34.123
(The reason is, if we mess up one day,)

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:42.381
(we will be calm enough
to figure out how to get off the hook.)

00:03:53.113 --> 00:03:54.149
Inspector.

00:03:54.663 --> 00:03:56.237
Don’t say anything.

00:03:58.083 --> 00:04:00.397
I’ve worked hard on the case.

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:01.277
I know.

00:04:01.713 --> 00:04:03.381
But we received a tip that

00:04:03.973 --> 00:04:06.437
you are involved with one of the suspects.

00:04:06.623 --> 00:04:11.133
You know that this is a high-profile case.

00:04:11.673 --> 00:04:14.589
I think it’d be better for you
to step away from the case.

00:04:15.353 --> 00:04:17.197
Before things get out of hand.

00:04:17.237 --> 00:04:20.437
And I have to impose disciplinary action on you.

00:04:22.433 --> 00:04:23.517
I got it, Inspector.

00:04:49.513 --> 00:04:51.061
Picha is in a hospital.

00:04:53.833 --> 00:04:56.061
Team B found her unconscious
in the abandoned house

00:04:56.109 --> 00:04:57.381
where the phone’s signal was tracked.

00:04:59.193 --> 00:05:00.701
How did she get there?

00:05:01.093 --> 00:05:03.093
Only the members of the team know about this.

00:05:03.661 --> 00:05:05.663
I think you would want to know it.

00:05:07.033 --> 00:05:08.397
Why are you telling me?

00:05:09.757 --> 00:05:11.753
Because I know you would want to visit her.

00:05:13.673 --> 00:05:15.365
Actually, I’m not telling you anything.

00:05:17.213 --> 00:05:20.989
I’m reading a report and
you accidentally see the name of the hospital.

00:05:28.883 --> 00:05:29.829
Thanks.

00:05:39.833 --> 00:05:40.789
Chompoo.

00:05:42.989 --> 00:05:44.933
Picha was discharged from the ER.

00:05:45.243 --> 00:05:46.805
The doctor said she only passed out.

00:05:47.283 --> 00:05:49.597
When she wakes up,
they’ll transfer her to an inpatient room.

00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:02.709
Doing okay?

00:06:04.713 --> 00:06:05.861
Yes.

00:06:05.893 --> 00:06:07.381
The doctor said her condition is not serious.

00:06:10.433 --> 00:06:11.877
I’m talking about you.

00:06:12.197 --> 00:06:13.153
Are you okay?

00:06:15.693 --> 00:06:16.541
Yes.

00:06:28.833 --> 00:06:32.405
Chompoo, did you see who attacked Picha?

00:06:37.243 --> 00:06:38.197
Bua.

00:06:41.793 --> 00:06:44.581
I saw Bua running out of the house with a man.

00:06:55.323 --> 00:06:58.269
I backed up data from Chatfah’s phone.

00:06:58.853 --> 00:07:00.365
It’s downloading.

00:07:01.103 --> 00:07:04.789
I wiped our fingerprints from her phone.

00:07:05.233 --> 00:07:08.141
Even if the police find it,
they cannot trace it to us.

00:07:10.581 --> 00:07:11.205
Hey.

00:07:12.713 --> 00:07:13.645
What are you thinking?

00:07:14.061 --> 00:07:16.063
Why did Chat do this?

00:07:18.323 --> 00:07:19.893
Are you sure…

00:07:20.633 --> 00:07:23.533
the woman who met with the hitman
was Chatfah?

00:07:29.717 --> 00:07:31.713
Then…

00:07:32.701 --> 00:07:34.703
there’s only one reason.

00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:38.965
Chatfah wanted to disappear.

00:07:40.063 --> 00:07:41.365
Yes.

00:07:42.683 --> 00:07:43.885
Then what?

00:07:44.643 --> 00:07:47.077
Why did she do that?

00:07:47.483 --> 00:07:48.837
What is she going to do next?

00:07:53.043 --> 00:07:55.389
I think we might find the answer in there.

00:07:56.513 --> 00:08:00.685
There must be something
that she hid and never told anyone.

00:08:01.243 --> 00:08:03.829
She might be fooled by someone.

00:08:04.743 --> 00:08:06.013
She was fooled?

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:09.085
There’s no way she was fooled.

00:08:10.473 --> 00:08:12.813
Stop thinking so highly of her.

00:08:14.673 --> 00:08:15.365
Why?

00:08:16.005 --> 00:08:18.003
Why do you love her this much?

00:08:19.913 --> 00:08:22.365
Is it because she saved your life?

00:08:22.381 --> 00:08:24.021
That’s why you love her?

00:08:26.303 --> 00:08:29.629
My sister is not as innocent as you think.

00:08:30.661 --> 00:08:33.013
Everything that she did was for her own benefit.

00:08:33.069 --> 00:08:34.485
You are her sister.

00:08:35.893 --> 00:08:37.605
You are her family.

00:08:40.493 --> 00:08:44.445
You are only the few people in this world
who can help her.

00:08:46.273 --> 00:08:47.549
Why do you think poorly of her?

00:08:47.581 --> 00:08:49.181
Because I’m her sister.

00:08:49.813 --> 00:08:53.829
That’s why I know what she is capable of.

00:08:55.393 --> 00:08:56.421
What would you know?

00:09:00.653 --> 00:09:02.421
Now, I get it,

00:09:03.303 --> 00:09:05.325
why Chatfah wanted to disappear.

00:09:06.513 --> 00:09:08.093
Because she has a sister like you.

00:09:08.963 --> 00:09:10.325
It means she has no one.

00:09:14.693 --> 00:09:18.309
Your family is not a family.

00:09:19.473 --> 00:09:22.093
All of you only care about yourself.

00:09:39.713 --> 00:09:41.101
Does it mean that

00:09:41.423 --> 00:09:44.989
Bua is not in danger after her disappearance?

00:09:46.373 --> 00:09:47.181
I…

00:09:47.603 --> 00:09:49.021
I’m not sure.

00:09:50.813 --> 00:09:53.541
I don’t know why she was there.

00:09:54.413 --> 00:09:59.605
I don’t want to believe
that Bua and that man attacked Pi.

00:10:02.913 --> 00:10:05.821
But I don’t get why she was there.

00:10:05.845 --> 00:10:06.917
Calm down.

00:10:08.181 --> 00:10:10.183
We don’t have any evidence to support it.

00:10:10.983 --> 00:10:13.213
I was dismissed from the investigation team.

00:10:13.753 --> 00:10:15.381
I don’t have any updates on the case.

00:10:17.661 --> 00:10:19.663
Then what are you doing here?

00:10:28.393 --> 00:10:30.285
The patient is sent to an inpatient room.

00:10:30.713 --> 00:10:32.253
You can visit her now.

00:10:54.803 --> 00:10:57.293
We searched the crime scene.

00:10:57.793 --> 00:10:59.629
No traces of forced entry were found.

00:11:00.053 --> 00:11:01.757
Neither are the traces of a struggle.

00:11:02.433 --> 00:11:05.973
We believe that he was shot by his wife.

00:11:07.613 --> 00:11:09.613
Nothing was missing from the crime scene.

00:11:14.063 --> 00:11:16.381
What about my dad’s golden watch?

00:11:18.843 --> 00:11:20.581
The pocket watch?

00:11:21.993 --> 00:11:25.213
My dad told me to get it cleaned.

00:11:25.533 --> 00:11:28.141
I put it back on the desk in his workroom.

00:11:28.189 --> 00:11:31.461
I was looking for it, but I couldn’t find it.

00:11:31.485 --> 00:11:32.917
It was not in the box either.

00:11:52.433 --> 00:11:54.693
If that’s what you think of her,

00:11:55.193 --> 00:11:57.965
you are as dangerous to her as her attacker.

00:12:19.633 --> 00:12:20.285
Pi.

00:12:21.003 --> 00:12:23.197
I’m sorry that I went there too late.

00:12:24.173 --> 00:12:25.293
I hope you’ll be alright.

00:12:26.153 --> 00:12:28.797
I’ll stay with her tonight.

00:12:29.513 --> 00:12:30.701
I’m worried about her.

00:12:31.323 --> 00:12:32.861
I don’t feel good about this.

00:12:42.033 --> 00:12:44.429
I can stay with her.

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:48.325
Captain Chain told me what happened.

00:12:48.357 --> 00:12:50.323
I rushed here because I’m worried about her.

00:12:51.353 --> 00:12:53.141
Thanks, Parn, for worrying about her.

00:12:53.453 --> 00:12:56.261
But I don’t want to bother you.

00:12:57.833 --> 00:13:00.021
Chom, we only have each other now.

00:13:01.893 --> 00:13:05.629
We are the Bupphachindas.

00:13:11.513 --> 00:13:12.253
Hello.

00:13:14.303 --> 00:13:15.525
I’m sorry, Miss Chomchai.

00:13:15.543 --> 00:13:17.013
It’s okay, Captain.

00:13:17.045 --> 00:13:18.663
I’ll take care of it.

00:13:36.153 --> 00:13:37.125
Aunty Chom.

00:13:37.993 --> 00:13:39.541
I’ll help you carry it.

00:13:39.573 --> 00:13:41.101
You are acting strangely today.

00:13:41.125 --> 00:13:44.221
Did you also get hit in the head like Picha?

00:13:44.623 --> 00:13:45.893
No, Aunty.

00:13:45.933 --> 00:13:48.093
I thought you might feel tired.

00:13:48.117 --> 00:13:49.173
So I want to help.

00:13:49.213 --> 00:13:51.245
It’s okay, Miss Chom.

00:13:51.261 --> 00:13:52.885
I can do it.

00:13:55.053 --> 00:13:58.053
You’ve been with our family for a long time.

00:13:58.093 --> 00:13:59.981
I never saw you leave the house.

00:14:00.483 --> 00:14:02.085
This is probably the first time I've seen it.

00:14:02.117 --> 00:14:04.661
I don’t like going out.

00:14:05.073 --> 00:14:06.501
It’s unfamiliar to me.

00:14:07.933 --> 00:14:09.701
I’ve lived with your family for a long time.

00:14:09.741 --> 00:14:11.381
I love and stay loyal to your family.

00:14:11.413 --> 00:14:13.893
The house became my home.

00:14:13.941 --> 00:14:18.541
Do you also think
the belongings in the house are yours?

00:14:22.543 --> 00:14:24.013
I know…

00:14:25.663 --> 00:14:28.069
you have something that doesn’t belong to you.

00:14:29.353 --> 00:14:32.325
Isn’t this considered a theft?

00:14:32.833 --> 00:14:34.429
I can fire you for that.

00:14:35.603 --> 00:14:39.925
If that thing is yours, then you’re right.

00:14:40.433 --> 00:14:44.741
But does what I have belong to you?

00:14:45.873 --> 00:14:48.389
I don’t think it’s yours.

00:14:48.621 --> 00:14:52.349
How did you know that it went missing?

00:14:54.653 --> 00:14:57.477
You can report it to the police if you want.

00:14:58.073 --> 00:15:02.221
But what do you want me to tell the police
where I found it?

00:15:02.723 --> 00:15:05.821
If I tell them that I found it under your bed,

00:15:06.233 --> 00:15:08.861
you might get into trouble.

00:15:12.313 --> 00:15:13.781
How much do you want?

00:15:14.993 --> 00:15:18.421
You should ask me what I want.

00:15:19.063 --> 00:15:23.989
I’m sick of the lies in your family.

00:15:25.283 --> 00:15:26.421
My family?

00:15:27.033 --> 00:15:29.629
My family has been taking good care of you.

00:15:29.943 --> 00:15:31.221
Are you sure about that?

00:15:32.713 --> 00:15:35.381
I don’t want to talk about this anymore.

00:15:35.757 --> 00:15:37.753
I have many things to do.

00:15:38.153 --> 00:15:41.197
I’ll put it this way.

00:15:41.701 --> 00:15:43.703
What I want is not something you can give.

00:15:44.963 --> 00:15:46.053
Wait.

00:15:46.423 --> 00:15:47.925
You’ve been living with us for a long time.

00:15:48.323 --> 00:15:49.845
You were close to my dad.

00:15:49.869 --> 00:15:51.429
He trusted you the most.

00:15:51.469 --> 00:15:52.805
How can you do this to me?

00:15:52.837 --> 00:15:57.333
How could you and Mr. Nathat do that?

00:15:58.433 --> 00:16:01.141
He’s your sister’s fiancé.

00:16:02.053 --> 00:16:06.301
We all have our own reasons.

00:16:07.393 --> 00:16:10.477
The only thing we have in common is

00:16:10.953 --> 00:16:13.181
that we do everything for our own benefit.

00:16:36.233 --> 00:16:37.973
I found your booze in the cabinet.

00:16:38.633 --> 00:16:39.709
Can I drink it?

00:16:40.693 --> 00:16:41.773
But you are drinking it.

00:16:50.553 --> 00:16:51.749
Do you want to drink with me?

00:16:52.813 --> 00:16:54.813
Are you telling me to drink my own booze?

00:17:01.903 --> 00:17:02.549
Here.

00:17:09.143 --> 00:17:10.797
I’ve been thinking.

00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:13.517
What you said is true.

00:17:14.453 --> 00:17:19.085
I have never been a good sister to Chat.

00:17:22.543 --> 00:17:23.701
It’s not surprising…

00:17:24.173 --> 00:17:26.909
that she would hire someone
to orchestrate her disappearance.

00:17:38.353 --> 00:17:40.557
My family is weird.

00:17:42.913 --> 00:17:45.349
We were taught

00:17:45.863 --> 00:17:48.421
that we need to prove that we are worthy of it.

00:17:50.313 --> 00:17:51.789
But actually,

00:17:51.837 --> 00:17:53.793
we should have received it unconditionally.

00:17:54.353 --> 00:17:55.229
What is it?

00:17:58.353 --> 00:17:59.493
Love.

00:18:03.993 --> 00:18:07.549
We were taught to be good people,

00:18:08.593 --> 00:18:11.053
if we want to receive love.

00:18:13.873 --> 00:18:16.501
We needed to be daughters
that our parents could be proud of.

00:18:17.413 --> 00:18:19.037
The daughters who deserved their love.

00:18:19.893 --> 00:18:21.997
The daughters who were worthy.

00:18:24.553 --> 00:18:26.253
But in fact,

00:18:26.277 --> 00:18:29.653
love should be a fundamental part of a family.

00:18:35.653 --> 00:18:37.213
They used love as leverage.

00:18:38.913 --> 00:18:41.429
So we would be obedient to them.

00:18:43.433 --> 00:18:44.725
They used hope…

00:18:45.743 --> 00:18:47.917
to turn us against each other.

00:18:50.421 --> 00:18:52.423
The more hope we got.

00:18:54.423 --> 00:18:56.869
The more we unknowingly hurt each other.

00:19:01.183 --> 00:19:02.981
But the truth is…

00:19:03.553 --> 00:19:06.661
our family should have been our safe zone.

00:19:07.543 --> 00:19:10.421
They should have loved us unconditionally.

00:19:30.261 --> 00:19:32.423
Anyone can be a parent.

00:19:33.653 --> 00:19:36.541
But not everyone can be a good parent.

00:19:37.763 --> 00:19:44.821
What you should do is
not pass on this wound and pain to others.

00:19:49.043 --> 00:19:50.581
As a daughter…

00:19:52.023 --> 00:19:53.213
and a sister,

00:19:54.513 --> 00:19:56.117
I think you’re doing your job well.

00:20:17.553 --> 00:20:18.909
Your glass is empty.

00:20:19.973 --> 00:20:21.253
I’ll get it refilled.

00:20:46.813 --> 00:20:48.333
Pi, you are awake.

00:20:49.663 --> 00:20:51.117
Chat, you are back.

00:20:52.277 --> 00:20:53.477
I’m back.

00:20:54.373 --> 00:20:55.997
Where have you been?

00:20:56.503 --> 00:20:58.317
Everyone was looking for you.

00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:03.109
We only miss someone…

00:21:05.637 --> 00:21:07.633
when they are away.

00:21:08.429 --> 00:21:09.869
It’s strange.

00:21:09.917 --> 00:21:11.593
When I was around,

00:21:12.141 --> 00:21:14.143
You guys always made a fuss.

00:21:15.653 --> 00:21:17.349
What are you talking about?

00:21:17.933 --> 00:21:19.933
I’m happy that you are back.

00:21:22.613 --> 00:21:24.813
I’m really glad that you are back.

00:21:26.263 --> 00:21:29.805
Pi, aren’t you mad that I betrayed you?

00:21:30.553 --> 00:21:31.597
No.

00:21:31.973 --> 00:21:33.277
I’m not mad at you anymore.

00:21:33.933 --> 00:21:36.781
It’s not a big deal, compared to your safety.

00:21:39.023 --> 00:21:42.701
Now I realized
our family is the most important thing.

00:21:44.117 --> 00:21:47.309
All I want is for you and Bua to return safely.

00:21:57.333 --> 00:21:59.333
Are you acting fake?

00:22:01.803 --> 00:22:03.381
Think carefully.

00:22:03.913 --> 00:22:07.709
What is the cause of everything that happened?

00:22:12.313 --> 00:22:14.173
How did it start?

00:22:15.143 --> 00:22:17.405
If you figure it out,

00:22:17.773 --> 00:22:19.773
you will stop acting fake.

00:22:21.237 --> 00:22:23.233
Because the truth is…

00:22:24.873 --> 00:22:28.829
we always put ourselves first.

00:22:43.113 --> 00:22:43.829
Picha.

00:22:45.023 --> 00:22:45.733
Picha.

00:22:46.273 --> 00:22:47.253
You are awake.

00:22:52.513 --> 00:22:53.757
I…

00:22:53.781 --> 00:22:55.753
You don’t need to say anything.

00:22:56.193 --> 00:22:57.605
You should rest.

00:22:57.645 --> 00:22:58.821
Tomorrow morning,

00:22:58.861 --> 00:23:00.823
police will come here to interview you.

00:23:06.913 --> 00:23:07.669
No.

00:23:08.163 --> 00:23:09.461
I have to say it.

00:23:10.103 --> 00:23:11.733
I have to tell someone.

00:23:13.673 --> 00:23:15.965
My family has too many secrets.

00:23:18.433 --> 00:23:20.101
I’ll tell you everything.

00:24:20.477 --> 00:24:22.473
This whole family is full of liars.

00:24:31.233 --> 00:24:33.421
If this ring falls into the hands of the police,

00:24:34.273 --> 00:24:37.605
your daughter will be in big trouble, Mr. Asok.

00:25:13.957 --> 00:25:14.837
Aunty Chom.

00:25:17.263 --> 00:25:19.645
Miss Chompoo, when did you get here?

00:25:19.685 --> 00:25:21.285
Why didn’t you tell me?

00:25:22.713 --> 00:25:24.021
I just got here.

00:25:24.061 --> 00:25:26.157
I came to get Pi’s clothes.

00:25:26.557 --> 00:25:28.553
Do you really need to come here to get them?

00:25:29.629 --> 00:25:30.421
Yes.

00:25:32.645 --> 00:25:34.141
I've got to go.

00:25:35.673 --> 00:25:37.925
Where are her clothes?

00:25:42.333 --> 00:25:45.333
I just remember
that she doesn’t need them yet.

00:25:45.593 --> 00:25:49.245
Does lying run in your family?

00:25:49.277 --> 00:25:52.189
Mr. Asok, Mrs. Pimol,

00:25:52.229 --> 00:25:53.405
and Miss Chompoo all do it.

00:25:54.757 --> 00:25:55.773
Aunty Chom!

00:25:56.033 --> 00:25:58.613
You take someone else’s belongings.

00:25:58.653 --> 00:26:00.973
Although I’m just a house helper,

00:26:01.021 --> 00:26:03.605
I don’t think you should do it.

00:26:05.603 --> 00:26:06.493
So what?

00:26:07.393 --> 00:26:09.813
It’s actually mine.

00:26:09.853 --> 00:26:11.349
It was in my room.

00:26:11.389 --> 00:26:13.325
You are the one who took it.

00:26:13.633 --> 00:26:16.373
But it’s Nathat’s engagement ring.

00:26:16.733 --> 00:26:19.653
How could it be in your room?

00:26:20.703 --> 00:26:21.973
Tell me.

00:26:22.663 --> 00:26:24.797
Admit it.

00:26:24.829 --> 00:26:27.629
You had an affair with Chat’s fiancé.

00:26:30.453 --> 00:26:32.821
Are you out of your mind?

00:26:32.853 --> 00:26:35.869
So what if I was his lover?

00:26:35.917 --> 00:26:37.205
What would you do about it?

00:26:37.523 --> 00:26:40.253
I can’t do anything to you.

00:26:40.293 --> 00:26:43.869
Even a bigger scandal can’t do anything to you.

00:26:44.203 --> 00:26:48.013
You are the hardest one to handle.

00:26:49.557 --> 00:26:52.837
But Nathat is not like you.

00:26:53.563 --> 00:26:56.141
If I tell the police about it,

00:26:56.181 --> 00:26:59.093
It will be a turn of events.

00:27:00.353 --> 00:27:03.389
Are you out of your mind?

00:27:03.413 --> 00:27:05.765
Do you miss Dad so much
that you become delusional?

00:27:06.293 --> 00:27:08.293
You are the crazy one!

00:27:08.325 --> 00:27:10.157
Among the members of your family,

00:27:10.181 --> 00:27:11.997
I hate you the most.

00:27:12.713 --> 00:27:14.029
You, crazy bitch.

00:27:14.663 --> 00:27:15.973
No, you are the crazy bitch.

00:27:15.997 --> 00:27:17.093
Where are you going?

00:27:20.133 --> 00:27:21.485
You, witch!

00:27:30.557 --> 00:27:31.597
Bitch.

00:27:36.709 --> 00:27:37.557
Bitch.

00:27:39.349 --> 00:27:40.837
Bitch, let me go.

00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:45.581
You, crazy bitch.

00:27:56.263 --> 00:27:57.805
What took you so long?

00:27:57.829 --> 00:27:58.981
Did you get the ring?

00:27:59.013 --> 00:27:59.885
Yes.

00:28:00.153 --> 00:28:00.573
Let’s go.

00:28:00.605 --> 00:28:01.501
Wait.

00:28:04.033 --> 00:28:06.461
Bitch, you are fired.

00:28:20.853 --> 00:28:21.973
Be gentle.

00:28:26.913 --> 00:28:27.893
Damn!

00:28:28.605 --> 00:28:30.603
I know that she is weird.

00:28:30.973 --> 00:28:32.373
But I never thought she was a psycho.

00:28:34.093 --> 00:28:36.493
How did I live with her for many years?

00:28:37.223 --> 00:28:38.101
You’re right.

00:28:38.133 --> 00:28:39.381
She is so creepy.

00:28:41.273 --> 00:28:41.965
Hey.

00:28:42.873 --> 00:28:45.653
Is it possible that Chatfah was stabbed…

00:28:46.563 --> 00:28:48.141
by her?

00:28:50.353 --> 00:28:51.213
No.

00:28:51.473 --> 00:28:52.717
I need to tell the police about this.

00:28:52.749 --> 00:28:54.003
You can’t do that.

00:28:55.381 --> 00:28:57.383
What if they ask you about the ring?

00:28:57.973 --> 00:28:59.469
It will trace back to Nathat.

00:28:59.501 --> 00:29:00.269
Right?

00:29:02.349 --> 00:29:04.353
Then all I can do is fire her?

00:29:04.381 --> 00:29:06.141
She tried to kill me.

00:29:08.405 --> 00:29:10.403
I’m not saying that
you should let her get away with it.

00:29:11.197 --> 00:29:12.069
But…

00:29:12.983 --> 00:29:14.261
I want you to think carefully.

00:29:16.513 --> 00:29:20.141
What are you going to tell the police
about Nathat?

00:29:26.173 --> 00:29:27.197
I don’t know.

00:29:28.773 --> 00:29:31.005
Things are getting out of hand.

00:29:31.243 --> 00:29:33.629
It started with covering up a lie.

00:29:34.461 --> 00:29:36.463
Now, it spirals to a dozen lies.

00:29:37.653 --> 00:29:39.653
I don’t want to create another problem

00:29:40.433 --> 00:29:41.581
I want to fix it.

00:29:43.333 --> 00:29:44.877
But some of the problems

00:29:45.763 --> 00:29:47.485
you aren’t the only one who started it.

00:29:58.509 --> 00:30:00.513
Thank you for coming to see me.

00:30:02.253 --> 00:30:03.429
It’s your request.

00:30:03.461 --> 00:30:04.797
Of course, I have to come.

00:30:09.993 --> 00:30:11.157
I found it.

00:30:12.763 --> 00:30:14.397
The only evidence…

00:30:15.223 --> 00:30:17.221
proving that you were at the house that night.

00:30:24.393 --> 00:30:25.421
I’m sorry.

00:30:26.933 --> 00:30:28.597
But I can’t return it to you.

00:30:29.933 --> 00:30:30.885
Why?

00:30:34.163 --> 00:30:35.493
Like I told you.

00:30:37.043 --> 00:30:38.845
I trust no one.

00:30:39.893 --> 00:30:41.669
But I want you to trust me.

00:30:43.673 --> 00:30:46.341
I will do my best to keep this secret,

00:30:49.093 --> 00:30:50.789
if you do what I tell you.

00:30:53.773 --> 00:30:54.661
Chom.

00:30:56.093 --> 00:30:57.973
Are you blackmailing me?

00:30:59.353 --> 00:31:00.933
You can see it that way.

00:31:02.633 --> 00:31:04.405
But I’ll call it…

00:31:05.873 --> 00:31:08.261
our mutual benefits.

00:31:15.885 --> 00:31:16.621
Fine.

00:31:19.033 --> 00:31:20.277
What do you want me to do?

00:31:24.033 --> 00:31:25.437
Protect me.

00:31:32.243 --> 00:31:33.853
There’s a secret…

00:31:33.877 --> 00:31:36.717
that no one in my family dares to talk about.

00:31:38.433 --> 00:31:39.149
Secret?

00:31:40.093 --> 00:31:41.125
What secret?

00:31:47.863 --> 00:31:50.285
Why did my mom shoot my dad?

00:31:55.103 --> 00:31:56.981
Then she shot herself.

00:32:01.083 --> 00:32:03.389
We are all curious about it.

00:32:04.553 --> 00:32:05.869
But none of us talks about it.

00:32:05.893 --> 00:32:07.501
Because we are afraid to know the answer.

00:32:09.183 --> 00:32:10.597
Except Chatfah.

00:32:11.821 --> 00:32:15.237
She was the only one
who had been trying to find the truth.

00:32:17.523 --> 00:32:18.621
On that night,

00:32:19.033 --> 00:32:21.621
she also asked us this question.

00:32:23.623 --> 00:32:26.069
In exchange, she would share
a part of her inheritance with us.

00:32:30.413 --> 00:32:33.573
My family always lies to each other
like it’s normal.

00:32:35.353 --> 00:32:36.685
For our survival,

00:32:37.603 --> 00:32:38.861
we put ourselves first.

00:32:40.413 --> 00:32:43.205
We choose to hide problems,
rather than fixing them.

00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:49.117
That’s what our parents taught us.

00:32:51.913 --> 00:32:54.021
Lying our way out of it,

00:32:56.743 --> 00:32:58.669
that’s what we need to do.

00:33:03.393 --> 00:33:05.381
We didn’t tell Mom that we would come home.

00:33:05.421 --> 00:33:06.509
Do you think she will be home?

00:33:09.773 --> 00:33:11.773
Mom is home.

00:33:11.829 --> 00:33:13.221
Let’s prank her.

00:33:13.261 --> 00:33:14.053
Keep quiet.

00:33:36.437 --> 00:33:38.433
Why didn’t you tell me
that you’re coming home?

00:33:39.723 --> 00:33:41.397
We went to the gym.

00:33:41.413 --> 00:33:43.221
We stopped by to take a shower.

00:33:47.383 --> 00:33:48.773
This is Mr. Chad.

00:33:49.533 --> 00:33:53.333
He was the chief engineer at our farm.

00:33:53.381 --> 00:33:54.669
He moved to America.

00:33:54.693 --> 00:33:55.805
But now, he has moved back.

00:34:02.853 --> 00:34:03.845
Hello.

00:34:05.469 --> 00:34:07.473
Hello. Nice to meet you.

00:34:08.233 --> 00:34:10.805
I think I should go.

00:34:10.821 --> 00:34:13.133
I’ll come to meet Mr. Asok another time.

00:34:16.073 --> 00:34:17.437
I’ll walk you out.

00:34:26.393 --> 00:34:27.909
Did you see what I saw?

00:34:28.823 --> 00:34:31.397
Is it what I think?

00:34:31.793 --> 00:34:33.421
It can’t be anything else.

00:34:33.461 --> 00:34:36.485
We were not two-year-old kids
who don’t know what that is.

00:34:39.233 --> 00:34:40.805
But that’s our mom.

00:34:41.363 --> 00:34:43.205
Because she is our mom.

00:34:44.143 --> 00:34:44.965
Bua.

00:34:46.073 --> 00:34:46.909
Why are you so quiet?

00:34:46.941 --> 00:34:48.021
Are you thinking what I’m thinking?

00:34:49.913 --> 00:34:50.821
Think what?

00:34:50.861 --> 00:34:52.061
I’m not thinking anything.

00:34:53.413 --> 00:34:54.757
You’re not thinking anything?

00:34:54.781 --> 00:34:55.797
How could you do that?

00:34:58.083 --> 00:34:59.549
It was nothing.

00:35:00.713 --> 00:35:02.349
He just moved back from the U.S.

00:35:02.389 --> 00:35:04.621
He’s probably still used to
the Western way of greeting.

00:35:06.103 --> 00:35:08.757
Which Westerns greet others by…

00:35:11.853 --> 00:35:12.829
The way he did.

00:35:13.713 --> 00:35:14.861
I ask you for real.

00:35:18.357 --> 00:35:19.869
We didn’t see anything.

00:35:20.823 --> 00:35:22.477
Stop talking about this.

00:35:30.473 --> 00:35:33.861
An engineer at a flower farm
was killed in an accident.

00:35:46.149 --> 00:35:47.003
This is not true.

00:35:49.393 --> 00:35:50.573
No.

00:35:50.605 --> 00:35:52.485
This is not true.

00:35:52.509 --> 00:35:54.621
This is not true.

00:35:55.773 --> 00:35:57.773
Mom, what happened?

00:35:59.273 --> 00:36:00.869
It cannot end like this.

00:36:01.701 --> 00:36:03.703
It cannot end like this.

00:36:03.733 --> 00:36:05.933
Mom, what are you talking about?

00:36:07.093 --> 00:36:08.733
It’s not an accident.

00:36:11.833 --> 00:36:13.213
Your dad.

00:36:13.973 --> 00:36:15.637
Your dad killed him.

00:36:18.473 --> 00:36:19.229
Mom.

00:36:19.693 --> 00:36:20.925
What happened?

00:36:28.833 --> 00:36:30.621
I’ll make him pay for it.

00:36:31.233 --> 00:36:32.885
I’ll make him pay for it.

00:36:35.781 --> 00:36:40.829
That incident is probably
the beginning of these tragedies.

00:36:42.793 --> 00:36:43.757
No.

00:36:45.143 --> 00:36:47.445
Something else might happen before that.

00:36:48.803 --> 00:36:50.413
But I don’t know about it.

00:36:55.023 --> 00:36:57.757
Do you know who he was?

00:36:58.597 --> 00:37:00.593
This is all I know.

00:37:02.333 --> 00:37:04.061
If you investigate it,

00:37:04.943 --> 00:37:06.781
you may get new information.

00:37:07.893 --> 00:37:09.629
Are you saying…

00:37:10.333 --> 00:37:13.341
your mom killed your dad because of this?

00:37:17.693 --> 00:37:19.221
But I still don’t get it.

00:37:21.003 --> 00:37:23.997
Why does Chatfah think someone else killed your mom?

00:37:24.543 --> 00:37:26.733
She probably knew the whole truth.

00:37:29.873 --> 00:37:32.605
I think Chatfah suspected that…

00:37:33.797 --> 00:37:35.793
among her three sisters,

00:37:37.903 --> 00:37:39.029
Bua,

00:37:39.973 --> 00:37:41.109
Chom,

00:37:41.753 --> 00:37:43.221
and I,

00:37:46.253 --> 00:37:52.045
who told Dad about Mom’s affair partner?

00:37:56.243 --> 00:37:59.045
Someone told Dad this secret.

00:38:00.433 --> 00:38:03.485
Then Mom decided to kill Dad.

00:38:03.517 --> 00:38:05.677
Because her affair partner was dead.

00:38:07.573 --> 00:38:09.965
It must be one of us.

00:38:26.023 --> 00:38:27.477
Thank you for today.

00:38:31.703 --> 00:38:33.149
For everything.

00:38:35.153 --> 00:38:35.973
I…

00:38:53.433 --> 00:38:54.957
You owe me again.

00:38:56.983 --> 00:38:58.253
What do you mean?

00:39:00.593 --> 00:39:02.405
I destroyed all the evidence for you.

00:39:03.433 --> 00:39:04.485
So…

00:39:05.533 --> 00:39:08.853
your life is now in my hands.

00:39:13.103 --> 00:39:14.733
You can’t leave me.

00:39:17.543 --> 00:39:19.213
This is the only way…

00:39:19.509 --> 00:39:21.333
to keep you with me.

00:39:23.473 --> 00:39:24.445
Nathat.

00:39:26.303 --> 00:39:27.621
He can’t do this.

00:39:29.363 --> 00:39:31.229
No one can.

00:39:53.013 --> 00:39:54.589
DON’T FORGET
A MEETING WITH UNCLE KAJORN.

00:40:32.685 --> 00:40:33.365
Hey.

00:40:34.613 --> 00:40:35.605
I know…

00:40:36.343 --> 00:40:39.005
you will find that in Chatfah’s phone.

00:40:40.353 --> 00:40:41.661
But I can explain it.

00:40:43.193 --> 00:40:44.405
Then explain it.

00:40:45.963 --> 00:40:46.773
Hey.

00:40:48.553 --> 00:40:50.725
Can you put the gun down first?

00:40:51.443 --> 00:40:52.373
No.

00:40:54.353 --> 00:40:56.565
I trust you way too much.

00:40:57.873 --> 00:41:02.533
You know that
I know a lot about you and your sisters.

00:41:03.103 --> 00:41:04.029
Right?

00:41:05.701 --> 00:41:06.677
Yes.

00:41:07.673 --> 00:41:10.021
But I never thought
you knew that much about us.

00:41:12.573 --> 00:41:14.045
What about Uncle Kajorn?

00:41:14.833 --> 00:41:16.485
Why did you go to meet him?

00:41:17.863 --> 00:41:19.621
Please put the gun down. Okay?

00:41:19.653 --> 00:41:20.501
No.

00:41:22.113 --> 00:41:23.333
If you put the gun down,

00:41:24.085 --> 00:41:26.083
I promise I will tell you everything.

00:41:26.117 --> 00:41:26.805
Please.

00:41:41.273 --> 00:41:43.069
Then let’s start with this.

00:41:49.673 --> 00:41:51.661
My dad’s watch.

00:41:51.685 --> 00:41:53.533
Why do you have it?

00:41:57.633 --> 00:42:00.021
My dad loved this watch.

00:42:00.637 --> 00:42:02.633
On the day he was killed,

00:42:03.353 --> 00:42:04.637
we all searched the whole house.

00:42:04.653 --> 00:42:05.893
But we couldn’t find it.

00:42:05.933 --> 00:42:07.365
Why do you have it?

00:42:07.397 --> 00:42:08.213
Okay.

00:42:09.083 --> 00:42:09.757
Answer me.

00:42:09.773 --> 00:42:10.397
Hold on.

00:42:12.393 --> 00:42:13.669
I promise…

00:42:14.485 --> 00:42:16.213
I’ll tell you everything.

00:42:17.073 --> 00:42:18.813
But you need to calm down.

00:42:19.553 --> 00:42:20.613
Please.

00:42:21.513 --> 00:42:22.797
Put the gun down.

00:42:23.533 --> 00:42:24.773
We can talk.

00:42:24.805 --> 00:42:26.165
Explain it.

00:42:27.543 --> 00:42:31.549
Then I’ll decide whether I should calm down.

00:42:33.623 --> 00:42:37.373
Chatfah sent this watch to me.

00:42:43.373 --> 00:42:44.861
Mom.

00:43:07.133 --> 00:43:09.917
(It’s scary to pay for our sins.)

00:43:10.953 --> 00:43:13.885
(So we try to do good deeds
as much as possible.)

00:43:14.653 --> 00:43:15.869
Does it mean…

00:43:17.083 --> 00:43:19.197
Chat was there when it happened?

00:43:29.125 --> 00:43:29.989
Why?

00:43:34.273 --> 00:43:36.789
Why did she pretend like she knew nothing?

00:43:42.853 --> 00:43:44.285
(So we can get away with it?)

00:43:45.713 --> 00:43:45.981
Stop.

00:43:46.013 --> 00:43:46.853
Let me go.

00:43:47.053 --> 00:43:48.853
(But I think it’s too late.)

00:43:49.053 --> 00:43:49.965
Calm down.

00:43:50.005 --> 00:43:51.653
Stop acting crazy! So we can talk.

00:43:51.685 --> 00:43:53.005
Talk about what?

00:43:53.363 --> 00:43:55.365
How can I believe anything you say?

00:43:55.405 --> 00:43:57.493
You have lied to me so many times.

00:43:57.757 --> 00:43:58.813
Okay.

00:44:00.589 --> 00:44:01.949
I’ll let you go.

00:44:02.783 --> 00:44:04.477
Then I’ll explain everything.

00:44:05.393 --> 00:44:07.029
I won’t hide anything from you.

00:44:08.293 --> 00:44:09.213
Okay?

00:44:24.445 --> 00:44:26.443
(My solution is…)

00:44:27.903 --> 00:44:30.029
(I need to live a long life.)

00:44:30.803 --> 00:44:34.205
(This way, I can postpone
paying for my sins for a while.)

00:44:34.981 --> 00:44:36.983
Then let’s start with this one.

00:44:40.383 --> 00:44:42.501
Who exactly are you?

00:44:47.003 --> 00:44:48.021
Tell me.

00:44:48.693 --> 00:44:50.421
Tell me who you are.

00:44:55.743 --> 00:44:58.477
I have no one I can trust.

00:44:58.509 --> 00:44:59.677
Then believe in yourself.

00:45:00.013 --> 00:45:02.557
Let’s end your family’s curse here.

00:45:02.581 --> 00:45:03.837
What do I need to do?

00:45:04.013 --> 00:45:07.029
I’ll help you find the truth.

00:45:07.803 --> 00:45:09.613
Who sent the flower basket to me?

00:45:09.903 --> 00:45:10.933
Was it this woman?

00:45:10.973 --> 00:45:12.485
I think so.

00:45:13.513 --> 00:45:15.725
I’m taking you with me.
