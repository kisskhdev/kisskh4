=This show deals with the sensitive topic of euthanasia, which may cause discomfort for some viewers. Additionally, the characters, events,
places, and groups depicted are purely fictional and bear no relation to reality. The child actors and animals were filmed under safe conditions.=.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.290
From now on

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.896
the three of us will do this together.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.440
Yeah, that's right.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.270
Ena, nice to meet you.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:25.820
Nice to meet you, yeah.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.540
Nice to meet you.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.416
Yes, we welcome any
group as long as it's all-female.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.440
Welcome.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.570
Before starting this work, let
me clarify the standards for you all.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:39.870
First

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.220
the client must have opinions
from three or more doctors

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.420
diagnosed as untreatable.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.940
Then,

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.670
they must be in a state of
unbearable physical disability.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.196
Lastly,

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.520
the pain must be beyond
the control of any medication.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.180
These are the standards.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:59.870
Got it?

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.920
Yes.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.346
Okay, understood.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.416
As the only male here, I
made a special preparation.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.440
Here.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.170
Alright.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.970
Okay.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.515
In the future

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:18.116
we will mix Buffalone into
this and provide it to the client.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.140
Here.

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.890
Of course, we haven't
added it yet, no worries.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.370
Alright.

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:35.789
We.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.470
Let's do our best together

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.420
=Dr. Death Mary=

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.030
=Episode 2=

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.329
=No Unauthorized Access=.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.166
She was fine before the performance.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.970
But suddenly when she got on stage...

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.670
Maybe it was due to nerves.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.540
Let me check your eyes.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.640
Is there a problem.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.170
Let's do an examination.
Please wait outside.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.840
We'll inform you once it's done.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.040
Okay.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.417
Dilated pupils

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:17.180
=Mydriasis: An abnormal expansion of the
pupils due to illness, medication, or injury=.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.480
We'll have to wait for the test results to be
sure, but it looks like an overdose of sedatives.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.490
Are you awake? You're in a hospital.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.060
Do you remember fainting
during the performance?

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.300
Did you take any medication beforehand?

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.740
I'll handle this.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:44.940
Alright.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.290
Yume.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.120
I know you did it due to anxiety, but
you can't just take medicine recklessly.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.290
Can you tell me what you took?

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.520
The test result will reveal it anyway.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.270
Just tell me.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.790
Is my mom here too?

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.146
She's probably in the waiting
room outside. Should I call her?

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.740
Don't tell my mom.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.320
I thought.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.140
It's medicine that helps calm emotions.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.820
What kind of medicine?

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.820
Buflon.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.270
Found it in your home warehouse.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.410
Picked it up accidentally.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.366
Does Caiyan know too?

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.890
She saw the medicine with me.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.940
Although she doesn't know I took it.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.370
I actually have stage fright.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.640
Please don't tell my mom. If she finds out,

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.240
she'll send me to a
foreign boarding school.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.040
This must be told.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.840
The test results will be out, can't lie.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.620
Patient's symptoms must be confidential.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.570
Aren't you a doctor?

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.546
You really sound like a lawyer.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.570
Although I'm not clear
on what the medicine is,

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.620
if my mom finds out, she
definitely won't let it go.

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.240
My mom is a very capable lawyer.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.470
You know what capable means, right?

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.220
You, me, Caiyan,

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.520
we'll all have headaches.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.176
=Seoul Police Department
Special Investigation Team=

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.146
=Suspects Woo Sojeong, Choi Dahyeon, Choi Ye-na=-
Woo Sojeong and Choi Dahyeon were college classmates.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.850
How did Choi Ye-na get involved with them?

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.402
It's Choi Ye-na's mother passed away
in a traffic accident when she was young.

00:06:07.426 --> 00:06:08.680
=Drug Serial Murder Case=.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.590
Lived with her alcoholic
father and twin brother.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.292
Brother Choi Gyeonsu has
cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease.

00:06:15.316 --> 00:06:23.316
=Cystic Fibrosis [Cystic Fibrosis]: A hereditary systemic disease
primarily causing extensive dysfunction of exocrine glands=.

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.896
The father was extremely abusive.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.396
- So the siblings were basically dependent on each other.
- Where did Choi Yongjun go?

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.420
Who are you?

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.990
Where did Choi Yongjun go?

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.096
- I'm asking who you are.
- Daring to get sick.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.496
You can't get sick without money.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.616
Let's talk outside. Go out and talk.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.640
Move aside.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.270
What are you doing?

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.920
Who is Choi Yongjun?

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.740
Don't come near me. I'll really kill you.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.020
Move aside.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.016
Her father left home seven years
ago and completely lost contact.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.040
Move aside.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.320
Later, her brother Choi Kyungsoo
was repeatedly hospitalized.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.316
Choi Ena served as his caregiver.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.490
She practically lived in the hospital.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.490
During that time, she developed a
close relationship with Woo Sojeong.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.516
Now she has graduated from university.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.840
She works as a nurse at Bunseong Hospital.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.570
She's in a lot of debt from high-interest
loans because of her brother's medical bills.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:14.980
=Choi Ena=

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.350
=Inmate colleague Kim Sigyeon=-
Bavlon's supplier Kim Sigyeon.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.840
Brother, it's time to eat.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.796
After Choi Daehyun started using drugs,

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.716
he was imprisoned for a medical incident.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.090
He was in the same cell.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.116
At the time, he was just
a small-time offender.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:32.270
Later, he controlled the distribution
network in Cambodia and became a big shot.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:33.916
- Thanks.
- Mmm.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.640
He must have someone backing him up.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.090
I don't know who's protecting him.

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.970
The special investigation team has been chasing
him for years, but they haven't caught a trace.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.040
Does Jin Suchan know that the drugs he
provided are being used for euthanasia?

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.266
Not sure.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.946
But considering Jin Suchan's level,
the volume of Bafloon is too small.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.940
He might not notice.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.670
Besides, he usually has his
subordinates handle the trades.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.540
However, once we start investigating,

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.990
The pressure will increase, it's just
a matter of time before he notices.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.640
If he knows his drugs are being
used for such dangerous things,

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.440
He won't spare Yu Sojeong.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.320
We need to catch her before
Jin Suchan makes a move.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:12.740
Yes.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.596
Considering the method of euthanasia,

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.616
Someone like Choi Daehyun,
who's had medical incidents,

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.716
=Choi Daehyun, Choi Yena=.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.470
Or the inexperienced nurse Choi
Yena, they're probably just assisting.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.016
The key is Yu Sojeong.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.566
She's not in it for the money,
she's driven by a fanatical belief.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.216
=Yu Sojeong=.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.840
First, check if Choi Daehyun
is involved with drugs again.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.390
That might lead to problems later...

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.789
Do you think our current investigation
methods are legally sound?

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.320
By the way,

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.900
What's the autopsy result
for athlete Choi Kangyoon?

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.040
It's coming out soon.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.160
So athlete Choi Kangyoon's wife is
currently in the investigation room.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.170
Get the materials ready.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:53.570
If we want to catch Yu Sojeong.

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:55.570
That woman's cooperation is crucial

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.120
= Suspects: Yoo Soo-jin,
Choi Da-hyeon, Choi Yena =.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.320
Name is Jo Soo-young, a boy.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.590
In late-stage colon
cancer, still in high school.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.170
You'll see in the file, he's already
been diagnosed with little time left.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:22.816
Where are your parents?

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.620
Did the family agree to our consultation?

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.670
It was the child who initially brought it up.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.040
Mother went missing after the divorce.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.090
Father was easier to
convince than expected.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.630
He mentioned there's
about half a month left.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:38.840
Time is pressing.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.220
As soon as I heard about this.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:51.770
I thought of my uncle.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.570
Though I've never met him.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.070
But my grandma always says.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:59.870
When I just started high school.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.370
My uncle died of colon
cancer in less than half a month.

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:07.190
So we must pay attention to health.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:10.240
I got so tired of hearing it.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:15.420
And that lousy gene ended
up being passed down to me.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.170
So you had already considered.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.340
If you were to get sick, you'd
undergo this kind of consultation?

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:31.216
Who would think about such
a bizarre thing in advance?

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.400
Especially when I'm so young.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.470
The doctor said.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.420
Half a month left.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.820
It's not time to settle matters.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.560
But a warning that during this time.

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:51.270
I will experience things like before.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.690
A completely different level of pain.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.240
So I want to die quickly.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:02.030
I'm already unwilling to face death.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.370
I don't want to suffer like that anymore.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.420
You know Yu So-jin from
Fenseong General Hospital, right?

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:17.340
Yes, she's an emergency department doctor.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.920
I first went to that
hospital through the ER.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.640
That's probably when I met her.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.266
But what's her connection
to my husband's death?

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:31.370
Did you ever see any private communication
between your husband and Yu So-jin?

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:36.016
Any notes or text messages between them?

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.946
Or did your husband ever have a
flip phone you hadn't seen before?

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:40.470
If you find anything suspicious.

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:43.420
You can apply for a warrant to investigate.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.340
I'm sorry if this makes you uncomfortable.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:04.440
Are you suspecting I'm hiding something?

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.440
I'll be frank.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:11.640
At the moment, we're not suspecting you.

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:12.670
We.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.390
Are focusing our attention on Yu So-jin

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:19.040
because she's been involved
in similar incidents before.

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.220
I don't know

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:35.190
how close my husband was with that woman.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.640
What kind of relationship they had.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.370
I see.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.890
But unfortunately

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:48.720
if we can't find enough
evidence to implicate Yu So-jin

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.320
then

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:54.890
you might also be considered a suspect.

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.820
So please try to remember anything you can.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.170
Hmm, has it been done?

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.520
Okay.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.070
The autopsy results are out.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.980
I'll go confirm the results.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.230
The patient seems unaware
of what it means to be dying.

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:36.990
His father looks devastated with guilt.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.730
But he already promised Zhao Xianyu, right?

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.460
Yes, but he might prioritize Xiuying.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.016
Yeah, Xiuying hasn't
even had time to worry.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.790
It's unbelievable such a
thing happens at a young age.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.260
By the way, if you have time,
check with Xiuying's mom.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:56.196
Based on the information from her dad,

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.140
there might be clues.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:00.836
Isn't finding people online your specialty?

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.576
I'm great at that kind of thing.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.926
Though time is a bit tight,

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:04.950
I can give it a try.

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:07.790
Oh, there's also Bavlon.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.586
Father Yang has been moved to the hospital.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:11.886
Keeping him at home is
dangerous with children around.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.966
Well done, given what happened.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:15.016
We need to be careful.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.890
Is it hidden in the cabinet?

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.856
Yeah, it's locked and password-secured.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.006
I'll manage it temporarily.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.140
That's excellent.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:23.270
Yeah, well done.

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:28.360
Cause of death confirmed as asphyxiation.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.626
But it's a fact Bavlon was
found on the body, right?

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:33.820
Yes, the deceased did take it.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.220
But it's not a lethal dose.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:38.310
So, does this mean.

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.566
The investigation into Choi
Kang-yoon's death can't proceed, right?

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:43.920
Yes, this time is different.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.366
If it was Woo Soo-jin's doing.

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:47.110
She would have precisely measured the dose.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.070
Asphyxiation could also
be intentional murder.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.206
Just suspect the victim's
wife and start investigating.

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:55.330
We confirmed the
dashcam of Mr. Choi's wife.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.976
She found the body after returning
home from grocery shopping.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.560
And then immediately called the police.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.826
Considering the timeline, it's impossible.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:03.766
Could it be that the wife
killed her husband beforehand.

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:05.420
Then went grocery shopping?

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.086
We found out that while the
wife was at the supermarket

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.480
Mr. Choi had a phone call
with his daughter in Seoul.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:11.610
Okay, Ji-woo.

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:14.490
Go to kindergarten and have a good time.

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:16.410
Listen to your grandma.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:18.900
Live well.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:21.810
While the wife was in the supermarket

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.830
Mr. Choi was certainly alive.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:29.300
You'll see once you watch it.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.316
The forensic team believes
multiple organ failure

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:36.680
=Multiple organ failure: Refers to the condition where
multiple organs function poorly or lose function=.

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:35.540
Causing breathing difficulties
was the main cause of death.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.246
Unfortunately, in this
case of Mr. Choi's death.

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:43.110
It's very hard to link it to Woo Soo-jin.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.120
Release the person.

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:25.776
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.136
I was wrong. Sorry.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.630
Sorry.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.040
Who are you acting cute for?

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.020
Are you crazy?

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.816
Because the items sent to
Japan were seized by the police.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.710
So there's no choice but to accept.

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:03.396
Tell your guys under you.

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.470
We need to assess what those items are.

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:07.075
Just because the police give them to us.

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:08.766
Doesn't mean we should act
like beggars and take them.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:10.830
We shouldn't accept
everything without discernment.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.800
Okay, sorry.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.339
If you know it's wrong,
why do things you'll regret?

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:21.400
You are a representative, after all.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.180
Manage your subordinates properly.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:26.190
Bang.

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:27.766
Bang bang bang.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.056
What are you doing? Seriously, what?

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.270
What are you looking at?

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.410
What are you staring at?

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.080
How did you handle it with Dr. Choi?

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:44.426
He insisted he saw the seal
broken and diluted with water.

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:46.520
So I gave him a new bottle.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.780
Judging by how that guy
knew the item's condition,

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.200
It shouldn't end so simply.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.230
Feels like he let it go himself.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.370
Look at this kid.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.640
Who is he helping to let go?

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.320
He's doing illegal surgeries,
what could happen?

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:06.760
You fool.

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:09.956
Surgical Pavulon.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:12.676
When there's so much cheap
Propofol readily available.

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.700
At least Dr. Choi pays
for his meds on time.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.720
And he doesn't haggle over prices.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.960
From now on.

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:22.910
Don't deal with him anymore.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.166
How strong is your connection.

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:27.440
To care for a cellmate like this?

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:29.400
What's your relationship?

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:40.130
If he contacts you again, firmly refuse.

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:48.520
Absolutely do not sell my stuff to him.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Do you understand?

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.520
Thank you.

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.100
Dr. Yoo, you're here.

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:07.810
What are you doing here?

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:09.840
Wait for me.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.880
Hello.

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:17.270
Didn't you ask me to think
about what I really want to do?

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.420
I've thought it over carefully.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.500
I want to organize my surroundings.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:27.000
And I won't need these things soon

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.220
I want to share them
with those who need them.

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:32.860
It won't happen immediately.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.970
Plus, my friend needs to
find a suitable place for you.

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.580
We also need to adjust the
schedule with other patients.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:41.850
It might take some time.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:43.900
Okay.

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:46.970
Just agreeing is enough.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:49.360
For me to keep going.

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.950
As long as it's not too late.

00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:59.710
Thank you.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.200
Follow me -Okay.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.730
He couldn't breathe
because the tube was blocked

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:41.296
I've performed a tracheotomy.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.557
If you suction here,
breathing will be smoother.

00:20:42.581 --> 00:20:44.867
Suction: To draw out mucus or
blood to aid patient's breathing.

00:20:44.891 --> 00:20:46.330
Finally relieved.

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:50.850
Sir, you're okay now.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:20:59.620
Thank you, Dr. Yu.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.146
Without a resident doctor.

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:03.710
This kind of thing happens often.

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:06.226
The nuns were so flustered.

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:07.686
Today wasn't even the
day for volunteer work.

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:09.360
But I just called you anyway.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:12.100
I was coming over to bring you something.

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:16.070
Please accept it, it's a donation.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.040
You're doing it again.

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:23.380
I'll accept it gratefully.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.830
I'm doing this for my own peace of mind.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.476
It's my personal reason,
so don't feel burdened.

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.920
Really? Then I'll just nod
my head like this from now on.

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:33.950
Thanks.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.420
I'm off tomorrow.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:38.726
Since I'm here, I'll check
on other patients too.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.970
Great, that would be perfect.

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:42.950
But what should I do.

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.986
A guest is here downstairs to see me.

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:47.730
Don't worry, I'll figure it out myself

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.700
I should have helped you.

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:51.830
But I haven't seen this
friend in a long time either.

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:55.300
He lives in the nursery
where I used to work.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.720
It's been a long time since he visited me.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.630
I'm very happy.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.300
He's gotten more handsome.

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:04.750
Tall and good-looking.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.230
Is the person you're
talking about Hyun Woo?

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:12.630
Yes, it's Hyun Woo.

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:15.450
How do you know Hyun Woo?

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:20.550
He previously came to
our hospital for treatment.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.040
Really?

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.030
That's quite a coincidence.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.860
I'll be on my way then.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.240
But.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.370
Is Hyun Woo sick?

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:43.390
Just a minor illness.

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:46.090
You should hurry down,
he's waiting for you.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.280
Okay.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:48.830
Thank you

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:09.551
=Lee Ji-young, hello. I'm contacting you to confirm if you're the Lee
Ji-young I know Do you know Zhao Soo-young from the class of 2000?=.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.430
My eyes hurt so much.

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:15.946
Why is Soo-young's mom's name so common?

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:18.116
There are so many
people named Lee Ji-young.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.820
How am I supposed to find Soo-young's mom?

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:20.290
Why are you sitting here?

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:23.330
Does it hurt a lot?

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:26.500
No, it doesn't hurt now.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.400
When I was walking down,
my vision suddenly blurred.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.770
This happens a lot lately.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.960
It's because the tumor is
pressing on the optic nerve.

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:38.740
I heard the doctor say so.

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:40.390
My vision will keep getting worse.

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:42.350
You go ahead

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:43.950
I need a little more time to recover.

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:56.820
I'll go down with you.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.250
I know you don't like relying on others.

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:07.340
I'm quite similar to you.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.480
Come down with me.

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:40.840
Why do you

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:42.770
do this kind of thing.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.490
Helping people who are near death.

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:52.470
I believe people should have the right

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:56.570
to choose between life and death.

00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:59.140
Choosing death is not a crime.

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:07.370
We help them spend their last moments

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:11.570
where they want to be.

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:16.220
If you remember your happiest place

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:18.720
get in touch with me.

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:22.570
I will.

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.120
Wow this this.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:49.296
Bang bang bang bang -Don't do that.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.466
No no -Okay okay.

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:51.490
Don't open it.

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:57.490
But your father bought you
such an expensive motorcycle?

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.240
- Then your father...
- Ah.

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:02.720
Sorry sorry -No way.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.570
Seems like your father has
deep regrets towards you.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:11.620
You guys should have
a good talk and reconcile.

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:20.620
Hey.

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:24.770
This is my memorial picture.

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.940
Even though I was the one
who suggested taking it first.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.916
But who would want to wear a
school uniform for a memorial photo?

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.540
Yeah, your school's
uniform is indeed quite ugly.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:35.166
Some kids might transfer because
they don't want to wear that uniform.

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:36.190
Right?

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.696
If that's the case,

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.240
might as well use the student
ID photo as the memorial picture.

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:41.370
My father, well,

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:43.416
he insists on making
decisions about everything.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.066
Why didn't you say anything
when you were taking the photo?

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:46.850
Wanted to wear
something else for the photo.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:52.096
Once, I secretly rode a motorcycle

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:54.070
and broke my leg,
ending up in the hospital.

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:57.040
When my father arrived at the hospital,

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:04.520
Yeah, your father really
went overboard, didn't he?

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.296
He beat me up many times
for riding motorcycles before.

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:08.870
Now that I'm dying,

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:11.296
he suddenly bought me
such an expensive motorcycle.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.866
But you really like that bike,

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:14.270
that's why you took it out, right?

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:18.866
That motorcycle has always been my dream.

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:20.270
That's why I accepted it.

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:23.220
I really wanted to ride.

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:27.000
But after getting sick, even riding
a motorcycle isn't fun anymore.

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:30.040
So I got angrier.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:31.790
Why buy it for me only now?

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:34.590
Anyway, I can't ride it now.

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:36.820
So did you suddenly start
thinking about suicide?

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:38.496
Without discussing it with your father?

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.270
Didn't your father say to follow my wishes?

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.646
But you should at least inform him, right?

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:46.846
You just left like that.
How hurt he must be.

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:47.996
Can't you just let me

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.696
go peacefully?

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.001
Mister, do you have a good
relationship with your father?

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:55.840
Just agree with him.

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:05.516
I won't force you to
reconcile with your father.

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:07.196
But don't you have any regrets?

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:08.840
Nothing weighing on your mind

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.520
or things to settle?

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.190
Is it really okay to leave like this?

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.896
Though dying without ever dating a girl

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.817
is a bit regrettable.

00:29:17.841 --> 00:29:18.970
Wait, hold on.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:25.570
You have no experience at all?

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.340
Like kissing or...

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.016
So, up till now,

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:34.146
you've only used your mouth for
eating and talking, never anything else?

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:36.046
Though I do have someone I'd like to date.

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:38.470
- Aren't people your age different?
- Hey, hey.

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:39.716
Can't let him go.

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.496
He can't die. He said he's a virgin.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.546
How can we just send off a child like this?

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:44.046
I absolutely won't allow it.

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.847
His resentment is too deep.

00:29:44.871 --> 00:29:47.046
He'll appear in my dreams
the next day after death.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:48.490
So what can we do?

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.696
I don't even have time to confess anymore.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.020
How is there no time?

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.440
As long as you express your
feelings, you and that person now

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:56.570
can do anything except marriage.

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:59.090
That's not possible -Why not.

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:03.070
Women...

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:05.716
All have a maternal instinct.

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:06.740
She...

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:11.216
She was my college classmate.

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.316
She also stuck with me
because of her maternal instinct.

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:15.220
Almost...

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.146
Like a mother to me -Mother.

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:18.170
Just like my mom.

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:20.796
Hey, what are you planning to do.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:23.020
This matter should be left to the experts.

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:26.540
You go ahead.

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:27.397
Go where.

00:30:27.421 --> 00:30:29.796
Call that person right now.

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.566
Just tell them your current
situation without embellishing.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:33.940
Then say you like her.

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:35.920
And you want to see her before you die.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:39.997
Will she really come out.

00:30:40.021 --> 00:30:41.190
Don't doubt it.

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.646
Afterwards, if you feel
some curiosity as a man.

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:44.946
Contact me immediately.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:47.670
Whether you need medicine
or advice, I can help you.

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:49.620
Can't you come with me directly.

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:50.866
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:51.890
Let's go

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:19.070
=Zhao Xianyuan, I want to go somewhere with you,
doctor=- I want to go somewhere with you, doctor.

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.720
Before becoming an independent adult.

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:25.920
I lived at this care home.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.220
While living here.

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:32.090
Were you happy?

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.740
The first time I moved out of here.

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.120
I moved into a dormitory.

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:45.520
At night, I lay down hoping to fall asleep.

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:48.290
But it was too quiet all around.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.890
It felt strange.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.070
I was left all alone.

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:56.290
When I lived in the foster home

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:57.790
I wasn't lonely at all.

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:00.290
I started having such thoughts.

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:24.920
You remind me to think
of the happiest place.

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.220
I can't come up with an answer.

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:29.646
But as a child

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:32.940
I lived nearby with my parents.

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.716
It's about to be redeveloped.

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.090
There are many vacant houses

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:38.470
I think I could rent one for a month.

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:43.470
Do you want to hold it there?

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:52.666
Hey, hey, you should've
mentioned it earlier.

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:54.920
She might have evening classes.

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.070
Didn't I already say it?

00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:59.190
Hye-jung is different from me.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:02.870
She's excellent at studying and drawing.

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:07.070
Unlike me, she has many
things she wishes to do.

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:09.420
But it's not so easily achievable.

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:13.996
Perhaps when you argued with her before.

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:15.920
Did you make a big mistake?

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:18.740
Well, not really.

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:21.040
We've been friends since childhood.

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:24.190
She told me not to hang
out with those people.

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.690
That's where the conflict began.

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:28.066
She did the right thing.

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:29.916
No, you should just confess directly.

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:32.266
She definitely doesn't know I like her.

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:33.766
She must be speechless.

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:35.196
Suddenly confessing right before dying.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:37.440
Aren't you going to try
before deciding to die...

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:40.820
And leave?

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:42.190
Aren't you?

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:45.216
I'm well experienced in
unrequited love, so I understand.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.940
Soo-young, Soo-young.

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:49.196
Confessing is all about timing.

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.496
Timing is really important for confessing.

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.490
Uncle, you like that
doctor lady, don't you?

00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:57.730
I missed the chance to confess.

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:00.870
Ugh, seriously, why
do I tell you everything?

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:02.866
When does the evening class end?

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:04.266
I'm so sick of it, it's driving me crazy.

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:05.720
Honestly.

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:10.139
Talking about death in
front of a dying person.

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:18.016
Sorry, sorry.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.340
I was too reckless, sorry.

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:22.965
She came out.

00:34:22.989 --> 00:34:24.090
It's Hye-jing.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:25.989
Where?

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.266
Who is it, who is it?

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:28.167
Over there, there.

00:34:28.191 --> 00:34:29.690
The person pushing the wheelchair.

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:35.690
What?

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.040
Hey.

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:40.120
You.

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:43.370
You've got a great eye.

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:49.969
Since elementary school, Hye-jin has
been pushing that friend's wheelchair.

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:52.969
Pretty cool, right?

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:55.139
I totally agree.

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:56.190
Hey.

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:58.696
It's not that you lack ability.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.340
You just have high standards.

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:02.397
If that's the reason,

00:35:02.421 --> 00:35:05.240
I fully understand why
you've been single since birth.

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:10.796
So kind-hearted.

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:12.090
Where is she going?

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:13.570
Hey.

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.540
She just left.

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.716
Hey, hey, Soo-young.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.140
We need to stop her.

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.120
Soo-young.

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:22.540
Soo-young, Soo-young - Wait.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.820
Hey - Wait.

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:34.670
Don't you miss your mom?

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:37.090
You won't find her.

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.790
She hates dad so much, she's just hiding.

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.240
Do you want me to help look?

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:43.870
Forget it.

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:46.790
I separated when I was very
young, I don't remember her.

00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:25.230
This is the only place open at this hour.

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:27.406
I don't mind,

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:28.460
but Dr. Woo, you...

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:32.930
Come, please enjoy.

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:35.310
If it's not enough, just call me.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:36.660
Okay.

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:40.410
It's great, and the food is delicious.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.480
That's good.

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:49.460
This is the first time I've seen you smile.

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:51.430
Ah...

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:56.680
It's almost over when you least expect it.

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.330
I feel a lot more at ease now.

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:03.136
If your headache gets
worse, let me know anytime.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.260
Don't just endure it.

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:06.730
Okay.

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:12.080
I'm reviewing the information.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:15.210
From new drugs to clinical trials.

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:16.830
You've tried everything there is.

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:23.440
You've worked so hard to keep living.

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:26.650
Why suddenly consider euthanasia?

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:32.150
Because I've tried everything.

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:36.700
Even though I've tried,
nothing has changed.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.400
It's precisely because I've done it all.

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:45.190
That I can let go.

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.990
Thank you.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:01.800
Eat quickly.

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:20.546
Take a careful look.

00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:23.006
There should be meaningful
clinical trial results, right?

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:24.050
Give up.

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:27.620
You've seen all the data and
done everything you could.

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:30.630
Besides, didn't you agree
to help Zhao Hyun-woo?

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.070
Giving up shouldn't be his personal choice.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.480
It's because there's no other way.

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:37.960
Isn't it you who shouldn't give up?

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:46.200
I know you feel sorry for Zhao
Hyun-woo, so you're really concerned.

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:49.660
Just see him off.

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:18.060
His will to survive is
stronger than anyone else's.

00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:23.020
It's not the first time you
misunderstood a patient's intentions.

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:08.180
=Brain Tumor=.

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:10.026
Yes, Jo Hyun-woo.

00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:13.086
He underwent chemotherapy
and clinical trials with us.

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.030
You know the process.

00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:17.216
It didn't slow the progression.

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:19.360
The last treatment was
three months ago, right?

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:23.356
Wasn't there any new
therapy to try during this period?

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:24.740
Even one that's still in research.

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:30.936
=Name: Jo Hyun-woo=.

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.170
Stay for a month first.

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:34.300
Let me know if you
want to continue staying.

00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:36.170
You'll realize it's great after a while.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:36.900
That's fine, right?

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.160
Yeah.

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:46.266
- It's really delicious.
- Yeah.

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:47.716
Did you take leave
yesterday because of this?

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:49.650
Oh, yes.

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:52.870
This food has the perfect temperature.

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:54.836
I cooked it at home to ensure
you can eat before leaving work.

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.060
Timed it perfectly to bring it from home.

00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:57.660
Oh, by the way.

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.296
These sweet potatoes were bought
for me from Gangwon-do by Dr. Woo.

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:03.270
- Ah, thank you.
- Thanks for the treat.

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:06.010
Oh, it really reminds me of my childhood.

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:09.126
After eating the steamed
sweet potatoes from grandma.

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:12.700
If barley rice was cooked
that night, we'd mix it together.

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:13.750
Oh, by the way.

00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:15.136
It's almost lunchtime.

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.966
Let's go have barley rice together.

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:18.916
Sure -Okay

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:20.286
I'll treat.

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:22.120
Let's all go together -Alright.

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:25.050
I...

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:27.606
Don't tell me you're going
to say you won't join us.

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:29.880
I have some urgent
personal matters to handle.

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:37.786
I steamed so many sweet
potatoes, my arm's about to break.

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:39.430
Are you really going to do this?

00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:41.616
I want you to become the
head of emergency medicine.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.640
I want to be the head nurse.

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:45.156
If you don't cooperate like this,

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:47.690
we'll really be like pigs
during the monsoon season.

00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:49.310
Pigs during the monsoon season?

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:50.810
Didn't you watch the weather news?

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:52.546
Swept away by the monsoon waters.

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:56.650
Not knowing where we'll drift,
always flowing downstream like pigs.

00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:58.806
Pigs and dogs are different, short legs.

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:00.076
So they're not good at swimming.

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:02.770
They can only go with the flow downstream.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.230
Simply put,

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:08.300
if this continues, you and I

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:12.290
will not only fail to get promoted but
will be marginalized by the hospital.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.496
It's almost time for the personnel changes.

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:17.870
Please, help me for a few hours.

00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:19.410
Okay?

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:24.616
Hmm. Did you find the paper I asked for?

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.530
There's no paper, but
there's a clinical trial.

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:29.491
It's a study being conducted in the
United States seeking volunteers.

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:31.720
I think it seems quite feasible.

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:33.010
Really?

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:35.096
What experiment? When will it start?

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.996
Because of security
issues, I can't send emails.

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:39.706
If you drop by, I can show you
the information sent from over there.

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:42.720
Got it. I'm heading to
the research institute now.

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:44.460
What?

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:48.086
Sorry, I have an urgent
matter. Take your time eating.

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:48.777
Sorry.

00:42:48.801 --> 00:42:51.386
No, Dr. Yu -Dr. Yu.

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:52.410
No...

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:01.690
Hmm Where are you now?

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:04.890
I just signed the contract for the house.

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:07.000
Let me come over and find you.

00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:20.680
Where are we going now?

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:24.400
The person in charge of the clinical
trial you applied for is someone I know.

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:26.847
Sorry.

00:43:26.871 --> 00:43:29.880
I also got a call suddenly,
so I didn't have time to tell you.

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:33.280
America is recruiting
new clinical trial volunteers.

00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:34.806
Treatment expenses are free.

00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:37.240
I can cover your stay expenses in America.

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:38.916
So let's go listen together.

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:41.106
Do you want me to go through it again?

00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:42.820
This time it's feasible.

00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:45.096
The first trial yielded
meaningful results...

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.730
But it couldn't eliminate the
tumor and only harmed my body.

00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:50.400
The tumor is the only thing
unscathed in my entire body.

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:51.840
I know.

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:54.086
But all the efforts so far haven't
gone to waste, have they?

00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:55.830
- Let's try one last time...
- Stop talking.

00:43:58.590 --> 00:43:59.590
Stop talking.

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.766
You know very well how much I'm suffering.

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:05.840
How can you suggest that so easily?

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:11.740
I guess I misjudged you.

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:17.230
Stop the car - It's not.

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:32.750
I know you're hurting,
but please reconsider.

00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:34.640
You're just like the other doctors.

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:36.366
Saying you understand.

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:39.310
But you don't really care how much pain
or discomfort the patients are in.

00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:42.030
I'll sort out my life myself.

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:43.780
Let's end the consultation here.

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:47.890
You did all those clinical
trials just to survive.

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:50.766
Why suddenly give up everything now?

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:52.320
I used to really want to live.

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:54.590
But not anymore.

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:29.040
I bought some porridge.

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:31.320
Get up and eat a little.

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:33.060
I'm very sleepy.

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:35.220
I'll eat later.

00:46:39.010 --> 00:46:40.616
=Emergency Room=.

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:43.370
The call you made is not being answered.

00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:50.222
Dr. Yoo, it's a patient
from a traffic accident.

00:46:50.246 --> 00:46:51.906
=Traffic Accident=.

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:53.246
Another delivery motorcycle.

00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:54.307
Was already dead on arrival.

00:46:54.331 --> 00:46:55.936
=Dead on Arrival=- Performed
CPR for half an hour just in case.

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:58.260
=CPR=- But there was no change.

00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:30.670
Patient Kim Hyun-joon.

00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:34.490
Died at 20:32.

00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:39.450
When Jo Hyun-woo
entered the emergency room,

00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:42.950
the guardian listed was
the delivery company's boss.

00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:53.511
=Delicious Food from the Republic
of Korea - The Delivery Brothers=.

00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:57.446
He just called to say he's quitting.

00:47:57.470 --> 00:48:00.610
I have the address he filled
out when he started working.

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:02.910
Not sure if he still lives there.

00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:06.730
Oh, he disappeared without a word.

00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:08.530
I'll keep the room reserved for now.

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:10.900
Is there anything you need?

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:13.920
Come in.

00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:54.710
=Allergic Reaction=.

00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:56.980
Ah, I remember this person.

00:48:57.260 --> 00:48:59.110
He came because of a sudden fever.

00:48:59.330 --> 00:49:01.210
But he had an allergic reaction.

00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:03.836
- So he can't take antipyretic analgesics.
- =Antipyretic Analgesics=.

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:06.780
- He needs anti-inflammatory analgesics.
- =Anti-inflammatory Analgesics=.

00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:11.100
Few customers give such
detailed information, so I remember.

00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:14.810
You mean the person
delivering on a motorcycle, right?

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:15.980
Yes.

00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:18.240
That person just bought painkillers here.

00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:46.737
What did you eat?

00:49:46.761 --> 00:49:48.536
Today? Not much of anything
since I have no appetite.

00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:51.930
Come on, you should eat
something even without an appetite.

00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:54.930
Oh, hello!

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.536
Do you have something
to keep bangs in place?

00:49:58.560 --> 00:49:59.686
Something to prevent them from falling?

00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:00.710
Bangs?

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:02.190
Let me check. Ah,

00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:04.510
This one is the best seller.

00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:06.976
Oh, it's really nice.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.320
Is it a gift for your girlfriend?

00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:09.620
Oh, it's nice.

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:14.710
Come on again.

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:24.600
Even if you're uncomfortable, bear with it.

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:26.670
If you can't close your eyes.

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:29.940
It could lead to vision problems.

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:34.440
In that case.

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:36.580
After regaining consciousness.

00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:38.336
It won't cause vision loss.

00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:40.070
You'll be able to see comfortably.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.400
Okay, good night.

00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:51.900
See you tomorrow.

00:50:58.620 --> 00:50:59.620
Dr. Yu.

00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:04.190
Do you know how Hyun-Woo has been lately?

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:06.140
How he's been doing?

00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:10.820
Do you know he's sick?

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:19.240
It's not a terminal illness, right?

00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:23.240
It's a brain tumor.

00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:24.820
The situation isn't good.

00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:33.360
Being young, I thought he'd be okay.

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:39.730
Do you know where Hyun-Woo lives?

00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:42.130
I can't reach him now either.

00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:45.730
Please help me find out.

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.240
Living alone is dangerous for him.

00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:51.210
Okay, understood.

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:02.540
Help me calculate the overdue rent.

00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:05.180
Throw away what's inside.

00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:06.936
Ah, but really.

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:09.370
A few days late and there
would have been big trouble.

00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:11.846
It's obvious he's the one living here.

00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:13.640
Owing debts and running from collectors.

00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:16.160
Someone also came
looking for him not long ago.

00:52:16.450 --> 00:52:18.290
Exceptionally beautiful.

00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:20.136
A woman who's both beautiful and elegant.

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:21.740
How did she find a place like this.

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:24.010
Excuse me.

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:27.640
Is it this woman.

00:52:28.170 --> 00:52:29.830
Yes, that's right, it's her.

00:52:31.070 --> 00:52:32.110
Look, isn't she beautiful.

00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:34.600
Her face is indeed very beautiful.

00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:47.436
That's enough.

00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:48.460
Let go of me.

00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:50.567
Here, here, no.

00:52:50.591 --> 00:52:52.266
Move aside -There's nobody here.

00:52:52.290 --> 00:52:53.237
Hey, I'm talking to you.

00:52:53.261 --> 00:52:54.266
Don't do that, sir.

00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:55.666
This area is only for long-term
patients, hurry up and leave.

00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:57.166
Get out of my way.

00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:59.690
Take them all down -Leave now.

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:04.916
You can't come in here.

00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:05.940
Please leave.

00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:07.916
Where is that woman, where.

00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:08.837
Ah, really.

00:53:08.861 --> 00:53:10.770
You can't do this -Where did you hide her.

00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:13.270
Ah, really.

00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:14.830
You can't do this.

00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:17.310
Where is that woman.

00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:22.876
Ah, so she's here.

00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:23.966
Come over.

00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:25.946
Ah, let go of me -Come over.

00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:30.150
Honey, I'm sorry -Get over here.

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:31.640
You're finished.

00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:41.880
Doctor, mind your own business.

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:43.330
Get away from me.

00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:46.230
Dr. Yu, get out.

00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:47.880
Get out, hurry up.

00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:50.520
Get out - Let go of me.

00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:53.467
Hey.

00:53:53.491 --> 00:53:54.630
Let's go down together.

00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:56.630
Hey, hey.

00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:59.010
Let's all die today.

00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:00.870
A fight to the death.

00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:02.200
Let's all die.

00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:03.490
Let's all die today.

00:54:03.810 --> 00:54:05.000
You're dead today.

00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:07.940
Let go of me What the hell.

00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:10.360
Doctor, step aside.

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:15.846
Honey, I was wrong.

00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:18.156
Let's all die - Honey

00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:19.560
I was wrong.

00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:32.790
Come out - What are you doing.

00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:35.206
It's my wife, can't I hit her?

00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:36.906
Quiet down, quiet down - Seriously.

00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:38.266
Let's talk at the station.

00:54:38.290 --> 00:54:40.490
Quiet down - Got it.

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:44.050
Father, go to the police
station - Okay, I will go, alright

00:54:44.350 --> 00:54:45.990
I'll head over first, yeah.

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:52.170
Return to your rooms, it's okay.

00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:04.200
Are you working again?

00:55:05.350 --> 00:55:06.350
Yes.

00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:09.020
Because I need to earn money.

00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:14.860
I went to the place where you used to live.

00:55:18.330 --> 00:55:19.330
I moved.

00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:21.866
Because I'm spending more time lying down.

00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:23.840
So I felt it wasn't
necessary to live in Seoul.

00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:28.880
But I still wanted to
come and see this place.

00:55:32.070 --> 00:55:33.680
I'm sorry about last time.

00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:37.056
I decided to start treatment
again without your consent.

00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:38.730
That was my fault.

00:55:41.590 --> 00:55:42.840
No, it was me.

00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:46.080
Being too sensitive.

00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:49.406
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have snapped at you.

00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:50.470
Thank you for today.

00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:55.550
But.

00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:59.266
Don't interfere in such
dangerous things again.

00:55:59.290 --> 00:56:01.730
Will I have a next time?

00:56:03.550 --> 00:56:04.970
With this kind of thing,

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:08.630
people like me should step in.

00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:10.920
Because your hair looked uncomfortable.

00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:23.680
It's not anything expensive.

00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:26.180
It's just.

00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:28.626
I saw it on my way
delivering, so I bought this.

00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:30.630
Take it.

00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:32.650
Thank you.

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:43.960
Do you want

00:56:49.410 --> 00:56:50.410
to end like this?

00:56:52.530 --> 00:56:53.700
I still

00:56:55.490 --> 00:56:56.770
don't meet your standards, do I?

00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:59.810
No.

00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:05.030
You perfectly meet the
consultation standards.

00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:08.720
After diagnosis by more than three doctors.

00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:12.876
Diagnosed by more than three doctors.

00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:14.130
Declared untreatable.

00:57:15.930 --> 00:57:17.560
And enduring unbearable

00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:20.260
physical and mental agony.

00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:24.550
Pain that medication can't alleviate.

00:57:26.050 --> 00:57:27.100
But why the hesitation.

00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:29.490
Why hesitate.

00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:34.780
These data

00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:39.360
say you will die

00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:48.700
but I hope you live.

00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:54.760
I know very well these data reveal

00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:56.880
terrifying truths.

00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:03.570
Yet, I still hope you live on.

00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:19.557
Uh.

00:58:19.581 --> 00:58:20.590
Hey, Hyun-woo.

00:58:22.530 --> 00:58:23.656
Hey, Cho Hyun-woo.

00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:24.820
Ah, sorry.

00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:00.520
Cho Hyun-woo

00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:42.320
=Doctor of Death Mary=.

00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:44.436
Choi Kang-yoon's wife came to see me.

00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:44.927
What.

00:59:44.951 --> 00:59:47.900
Be careful for a while,
there's only one dose left.

00:59:48.210 --> 00:59:49.676
If she brings the medicine over.

00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:52.440
Ask first about the euthanasia procedure.

00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:55.246
Hyun-woo, who was hospitalised
in hospice care, is missing

00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:57.566
I just want to die today.

00:59:57.590 --> 01:00:00.040
Urgently need Bavron.

01:00:01.070 --> 01:00:03.486
I want to personally see Hyun-woo off.

01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:06.266
Right, you two need to
say your final goodbyes

01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:08.770
I'll make sure you get to
the place you want to be.

01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:11.450
What should we do first?
