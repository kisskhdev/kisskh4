WEBVTT

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.200
I, the heir of Davichmetha,
hereby withdraw.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.440
We'll proceed with
the final fencing match

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.560
between the two clans:

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.520
Assavadevathin and Bhuchongpisut.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.920
Now, you finally see

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.360
who rules and who serves.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.840
Get up,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.520
or you won't be able to beat Khanin.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.280
He hasn't come here at all,
Your Royal Highness.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.000
Maybe this was our chance
to bring about change.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.720
You must win the fencing match.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.120
I feel so much pressure.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.160
Good luck.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.200
You've got this.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.440
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.320
the Royal Fencing Competition

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.400
is about to begin in just a few moments.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.960
Our nation, Emmaly,
is known across the world

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.200
for the strength of its fencers.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.120
Many of our fencers have ranked

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.930
among the best in the world.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.000
And today, we are about to witness
the most historic match

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.800
Emmaly has seen in decades.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.400
It marks a duel
between the clans of Assavadevathin

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.240
and Bhuchongpisut.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.320
May both princes

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.960
take their positions, please.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.490
Allow me to briefly introduce
Prince Khanin.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.640
Prince Khanin Assavadevathin

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.520
has recently returned
from the United Kingdom,

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.560
yet he's shown a deep passion
for embracing the culture of Emmaly.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.680
On social media, he's been praised
as a symbol of change.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.200
Up next, I present
Prince Ramil Bhuchongpisut,

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.200
a familiar and well-respected figure
among the Emmalians.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.520
He possesses
both intelligence and skills.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.440
He is fond of all sports
and excels in every one of them.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.360
As you all know, to ensure
the safety and security of all,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.200
today's match is taking place
in a closed setting.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.800
The moment has arrived.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.800
The Royal Fencing Competition
between the two royal clans

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.340
officially begins now.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.160

Mr. Thatdanai asked me to tell you that

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.520
you need to breathe.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.280
Breathe in.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.680
Breathe out.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.600
Feeling better?

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.560
Good luck.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.440

Yes, Your Royal Highness.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.760
Please be informed that

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.320
the Bhuchongpisut clan
has requested a ten-minute timeout

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.360
as permitted by the rules.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.640
I have done my best, Father.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.560
Is that the best you can do?

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.200
If you lose,

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.080
you know what's coming, don't you?

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.440
The Bhuchongpisuts will fall,
all thanks to you.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.480
If there's nothing else,

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.000
I shall take my leave.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.960

00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.400

Allez.
(Go)

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.880
Is this really all
the top fencer of the club has got?

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.240
Who the hell are you?

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.120
Young Prince.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.600
Young Prince...

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.480
Who are you talking about?

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.480
Men and women stand as equals.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.800
Gender makes no difference.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.640
It's skill that truly matters.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.240
I am...

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.680
Khanin Assavadevathin.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.280
If you stay this way,

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.520
victory will never be yours.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.520
While one vanished...

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.360
With both of you
joining the Competition,

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.160
it should be quite exciting.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.840
To have finally found Khanin,

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.440
my grandson,

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.840
is a miracle beyond words.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.720
This is my grandson,

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.880
Khanin Assavadevathin.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:40.840

Winner, salute!

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.440
Congratulations, Brother.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.520
Thank you, Brother Ramil.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.600
On behalf of the people of Emmaly,

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.360
I offer my heartfelt congratulations
to you, Your Royal Highness.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.000
Let's go and congratulate Khanin, Father.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.560
Okay.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.360
Let's go.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.520
You're amazing, Your Royal Highness.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.480
You did it!

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.520
As we all know,

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.200
Prince Khanin's victory

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:24.040
secures another reign on the throne
for the Assavadevathin clan.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:45.640
Your Royal Highness,

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.320
Prince Rachata has requested...

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.960
your presence.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.600
Please proceed this way.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.760
You're a disgrace, Ramil.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.200
How dare you give me that look?

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:29.400
How dare you?

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.440
You can slap me again. I won't stop you.

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:37.840
Now you're provoking me?

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.080
Fine.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.440
No number of slaps

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.360
can change what happened today.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.520
I have...

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.960
already lost to Khanin.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:01.200
Watch that mouth of yours.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.440
Who do you think you are?

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.720
I am your son, Father!

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
All this time,

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.320
I only wished to be a good son,

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.400
a good prince...

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.160
I tried to be a good man
to the one I love.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.320
But you took everything from me.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.840
You have gone mad.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.480
Because I've lost everything!

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.240
Right now,

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.200
I have nothing left.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.200
I'm the one

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.960
who gave you everything.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.040
Oh, did you?

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.520
Father,

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.880
when I fell,

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:06.640
did you ever care if I was okay?

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.560
Why?

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.560
It was nothing serious.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.400
Did you expect me to baby you?

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.520
Forget it, Father.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.480
It doesn't matter anymore.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.800
We may still be father and son in name,

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.520
but from this day on,

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.400
I will no longer serve
under your command.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.200
You're not allowed to leave.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:53.840
Ramil!

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:55.720
Ramil!

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:57.880
Ramil!

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:55.960
Father,

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.640
Khanin is here to see you.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.480
Grandfather...

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.200
Khanin...

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.080
Father told me that

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.560
you had sent your apology.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.240
So I want you to know...

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.440
I accept your apology, Grandfather.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.560
You're Charan, right?

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.440
Charan,

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.120
from now on, I'll be your grandfather.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.600
Call me Grandfather.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.280
Grandfather...

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.760
Remember,

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:55.440
even if you have no one else,

00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.200
you'll always have me.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.120
Let us all proceed.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.080
Ramil...

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.240
As the King of Emmaly,

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.080
I hereby proclaim
the principles of my reign.

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.760
From this day forth,

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.320
I shall devote my life
to serving every citizen of Emmaly,

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:32.720
and strive to resolve all matters,
great or small,

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:37.920
for the lasting peace of my people.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.800
How do you envision the future of Emmaly

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.880
from this point onward,
Your Royal Highness?

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.320
His Majesty the King has recognized
the environmental issues

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:27.520
and has issued policies to preserve
our country's natural heritage.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.200
We may soon see new regulations

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.680
that comprehensively address
environmental concerns.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.400
What about Your Royal Highness?

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.400
Might we know

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.840
what you wish to do next?

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:02.160
I shall stand in support
of His Majesty's work.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.920
As to how...

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.280
I'm still searching for the answer.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:11.920
Uh...

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.520
Aren't you sticking to the script,
Your Royal Highness?

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.280
It's better to say what I truly feel.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.390
♫Where the time has gone,♫

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:48.000
♫I just know you're my world, my dawn♫

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:52.590
♫You've taken my heart,
my soul, my way,♫

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:57.720
♫In this night, it's us who'll stay♫

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.960
♫Moonlight shines so bright♫

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.860
Will you dance with me,
my most trusted royal guard?

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.840
With utmost pleasure.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:16.330
♫This moment feels like it's truly mine♫

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:22.000
♫The world's a fairy tale,♫

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:26.840
♫In your arms tonight♫

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.400
♫I wish to stop this time,♫

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:35.040
♫And call you my endless light♫

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:57.960
Why didn't you stick
to the script, though?

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:03.080
I did not want to pretend.

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.640
Honestly, I still don't know

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.160
If I can't even answer that for myself,

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.120
If I can't even answer that for myself,

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:15.260
I don't want to lie about it, either.

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.120
But you know what, Ran?

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.520
There's one thing
I can say for sure right now.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.360
I want to be with you, Ran.

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:54.480
♫The world's a fairy tale,♫

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:59.960
♫In your arms tonight♫

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.440
♫I wish to stop this time,♫

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:09.120
♫And make you forever mine♫

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:16.800
♫Ooh, dancing in the moonlight with you,♫

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.200
♫Under the stars, just us two♫

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:30.880
♫With every beat, my heart's complete♫

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.320
♫You...♫

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.960
♫You made my dream come true♫

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:43.120
♫Oh, and it is only you♫

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.840
♫Hold me so tight,♫

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:53.680
♫All through the night♫

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.320
♫Hold me so tight,♫

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:13.360
♫All through the night♫

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.360
May I ask

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.280
what's on your mind?

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.160
Why are you two here?

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.400
Aren't you going inside?

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:52.740
My apologies, Father.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:58.640
What's on your mind?

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:04.920
I'm just...

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.800
considering something.

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.040
I've spoken with Thatdanai.

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:15.520
And I think...

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.560
as long as you're happy,

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.480
I won't dictate your path.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.600
Live your life
the way you truly want to.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.040
Thank you, Father.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.800
I need a little more time,
and I'll let you know soon.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.800
Let's go inside, shall we?

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:45.600
Paytai...

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000
Your Royal Highness...

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:55.040
How do you know I'm here?

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.320
I saw your painting.

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:11.840
- How have you been?
- How are you doing?

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:21.679
Have you...

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:25.639
received any punishment,
Your Royal Highness?

00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.720
Your Royal Highness,

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.000
are you alright?

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.440
I'm sorry.

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.960
I've never been the lover you deserved.

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:19.460
You...

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.100
don't need to be sorry,
Your Royal Highness.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:30.100
Your Royal Highness...

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.840
Please don't cry.

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:44.580
Can you tell me what happened?

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:51.840
My father...

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.560
was nothing but a madman,
drunk on power.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:55.900
I'm sorry.

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:57.140
It's okay.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.560
I truly am.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.400
I have nothing left now.

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:07.880
Neither do I, Your Royal Highness.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:15.080
I was born the son of a politician,

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.320
sent to serve you since I was a child.

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.600
And I...

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.040
foolishly believed that

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.480
everything I did
was for the sake of my family.

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.200
It's okay, Your Royal Highness.

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:30.680
Please don't cry.

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.120
Is it really okay?

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.800
I'm still here with you.

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:47.920
Thank you.

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.480
I will stay right by your side.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.280
Get this ready for me.

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:19.960
Sure, Your Royal Highness.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:25.680
What are you doing?

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.280
Since you're here,

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.200
I have something to tell you.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.960
I want a break today.

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:36.400
Please take me out.

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:39.920
If you want to go out,

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.200
you need to inform His Majesty first.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.680
I already did.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.480
You can ask Chakri.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:46.480
Sorry?

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.080
Oh...

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:53.080
His Majesty asked that
you look after His Royal Highness.

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.200
Where do you want to go?

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.880
This reminds me of...

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.560
when we ran away from the attackers
and came to Emmaly.

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:14.040
Someone here was really tough
at that time, huh?

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.800
If you weren't so stubborn,

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.040
your Unc-unc
wouldn't have been so tough.

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:20.800
Alright,

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.240
Unc-unc.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.720
I like calling you by that name.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.120
Then call me that again.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:32.520
Unc-unc...

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.200
We've tried that before.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.080
You want some again, right?

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:10.800
Prince Khanin,

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.520
how many sets would you like to get?

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.120
- One, please.
- Okay.

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:17.840
Here you go, Your Royal Highness.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.320
Come on,

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.840
let me feed you, Unc-unc.

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:16.960
Does it look good on me?

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:19.360
It's cute.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.080
You like it?

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.360
It's so pretty.

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:34.360
How cute.

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.520
But you're cuter.

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.280
Let's match.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:49.980
Cute.

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:56.680
I remember this.

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.240
We were eating grilled pork
together right here.

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:18.320
It feels so different
from the last time.

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.840
I remember...

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.760
having to tell you to smile.

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:28.360
I was worried we might be noticed,

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.080
or even worse,

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.320
you might be ambushed.

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.720
So you had that serious, stern look...

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:38.480
cause you were worried about me?

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.680
I think you could say that.

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.600
Just accept that you cared.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.000
Yes.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:52.800
I cared about you.

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:01.960
Then tell me if you love me.

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:19.920
I know

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:22.960
you have a lot on your mind.

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.240
And one of them...

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.440
is about me, isn't it?

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:36.120
It's not just you
I've been thinking about.

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.300
It's our future.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.320
Let's go somewhere quiet

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:52.200
and talk about us.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.040
What a beautiful starry night.

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:04.880
Yeah.

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:06.880
So beautiful.

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.840
Ran, what's that star?

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.400
Would you like to say something first?

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:07.360
Oh...

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:10.560
We're here to talk.

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.800
Right, that's why we're here.

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:18.640
So...

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:23.880
I've been thinking.

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.200
But before I say anything,

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.320
I wanna know
what you wanna do from now on.

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:34.720
I think...

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:37.360
I want to devote myself
to assisting His Majesty.

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.800
The pollution crisis
needs immediate action,

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:47.000
and I'll stand with him
in confronting the old power structure.

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:50.920
I understand.

00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:56.080
Having you support His Majesty

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.440
will surely give him peace of mind.

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:02.320
That sounds like a good path.

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:19.600
What about you?

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:22.160
What have you been thinking?

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.320
I've made up my mind.

00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:34.510
I'm going back to the UK

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:40.480
to study more about...

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.760
pollution management.

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.760
Maybe I'll learn something new

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:50.480
and help Emmaly grow in the future.

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:52.360
But...

00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:54.280
your title...

00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:57.160
I've never wanted a title.

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:00.040
I haven't changed my mind.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:02.680
Just like I told you before,

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:05.560
I want nothing more
than an ordinary life.

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:21.640
If I'm no longer a prince,

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:25.840
can you say you love me now?

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.080
I think...

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.480
If you have to think,

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:35.560
that means you can't, right?

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.040
That's not what I meant.

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:42.920
I just think...

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.400
if I say it,

00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:47.380
it might be inappropriate

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:49.720
or even wrong.

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.000
I get it.

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:08.200
I'll be waiting for the day
you can say you love me.

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:35.240
Big news for our nation today, guys!

00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:40.120
Prince Khanin
has renounced his royal title

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.680
to continue his education.

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:46.000
This announcement has ignited

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:48.640
widespread discussion.

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:52.520
Some believe Prince Khanin
should ascend to rule.

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:57.200
Or this... This might be
the beginning of real change.

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:02.680
Now that is truly Prince Khanin.

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:15.480
[Jay: Would it be possible
to see you again, Your Royal Highness?]

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:46.040
[Trust Gangnam Clinic
for Laser Hair Removal]

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.000
I'll send this to June.

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:00.880
Calvin?

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:04.560
Can we please talk?

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:16.040
I want to talk to you, too.

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:37.920
I'm sorry

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.200
for hiding who I really was from you.

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:45.320
I didn't mean to hide it at first.

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:48.200
I just felt...

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:52.560
nice having you as a friend.

00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:57.600
But as time went by,

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:02.800
I started feeling something deeper.

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:10.320
I kept waiting for the right moment

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:12.880
to tell you the truth about me,

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:16.640
but it just never came.

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:20.920
Your Royal Highness...

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:22.200
Please call me the way you used to.

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:31.880
I mean...

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:33.700
I admit that...

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:37.480
I was mad at first

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:39.480
because you lied to me.

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.320
But...

00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:45.600
I don't think you really meant to.

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:47.960
I never wanted to lie to you.

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:55.360
So, why are you here?

00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:58.720
Weren't you already called back?

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:02.920
Yes.

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:05.240
But I don't think...

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:08.480
I want to stay in Bhujar anymore.

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:14.680
What do you mean?

00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:26.310
When I first came here,

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:29.000
I didn't even want to study art.

00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:33.420
I was sent to this art university

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:36.400
by the royal family

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.040
to keep an unimportant prince like me

00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:46.400
from challenging my brother
for the throne.

00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:54.120
But after I met you,

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:56.440
I realized...

00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.600
I like art.

00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:07.400
And I like you.

00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:13.200
I don't know if you feel the same way,

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:15.820
but you mean a lot to me, Jay.

00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:20.440
I...

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:22.760
feel the same way.

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:31.120
What's confusing you?

00:52:31.590 --> 00:52:32.830
I mean,

00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:35.160
I like you, too.

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.200
Thanks.

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:21.880
Oh,

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.600
you're still up?

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:25.720
Yes, Father.

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:28.520
I have something for you.

00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:37.650
A portrait of you I painted.

00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:39.920
It may not be perfect,

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:41.720
but I did my best.

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:45.520
Thanks, dear.

00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:57.560
There's something else I need to say.

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:03.400
It's what I once asked of you

00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:05.920
that if I were to win,

00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:08.800
you would honor my request.

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:11.920
Would that be too much to ask, Father?

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:18.640
Emmaly means the people,

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.800
and democracy belongs to them.

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.400
Thank you, Father.

00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:32.760
You don't need to.

00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:35.080
It's what I ought to do.

00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:37.440
This land

00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:39.800
belongs to the people,

00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:42.240
not to us alone.

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:48.880
So,

00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:51.920
you're leaving tomorrow, right?

00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:54.640
Yes.

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:08.240
I want to thank you

00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:15.200
for everything, Father.

00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:19.040
Look,

00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:22.760
though I wasn't there to raise you,

00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:24.840
I love you

00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:27.120
unconditionally.

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:32.480
Your happiness

00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:34.760
brings me joy,

00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:38.040
and your pain

00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:39.760
brings me sorrow.

00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:43.200
If something's still bothering you,

00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:45.880
you can always come to me.

00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:01.480
The only thing that's still bothering me

00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:04.040
is the person I love.

00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:09.720
I know when it comes to that,

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:14.240
you'll do whatever you want.

00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:19.680
But the one in my heart won't agree.

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:40.720
You can go first.

00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:42.600
I want a moment with Ran.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.200
I'll wait for you there, then.

00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:58.520
Take good care of yourself here.

00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:14.160
I had the pearl
made into a necklace for you.

00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:20.600
This is beautiful.

00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:22.680
I'll put it on you.

00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:50.520
Will you be waiting for me, Nin?

00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:57.600
I'll never stop waiting.

00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:01.440
I...

00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:02.480
It's okay.

00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:06.560
I totally understand everything.

00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:12.120
Thank you for understanding me.

00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:14.400
You've got your duties to do.

00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:15.980
I know.

00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:20.360
But call me

00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:22.120
when you have time.

00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:24.560
Call me often.

00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:27.720
Okay.

00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:30.560
Come to me soon, okay?

00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:43.520
I'm leaving now.

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:45.960
You don't need to send me off.

00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:46.960
It's this close.

00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:51.040
I love you, Ran.

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.400
I...

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:07.680
Your Royal Highness...

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.360
Please wait for me, too!

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.120
Without you,

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.680
I don't know how I'll go on.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.080
Please...

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.720
Please let me come with you.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:25.920
Your Royal Highness!

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.480
Please. Please wait for me.

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:29.880
Prince Khanin... Oh!

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.440
Goodbye, Mr. Charan.

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:39.600
I, Chakri, am leaving for London.

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:00.800
Prince Khanin!

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:01.920
Wait up, please.

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.500
Your Royal Highness!

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:23.680
Your Royal Highness...

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:29.840
Look.

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:31.680
I've brought

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:35.720
Lolane Intense Care
Bond Repair Water Treatment with me.

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.020
Always the full name, huh?

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:43.200
Thanks.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:45.840
However,

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:47.800
this is not the palace.

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.320
We talk casually here,

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.000
okay?

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.240
Come sit with me,

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:03.840
mate.

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:06.600
Mate?

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:08.200
Mate.

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.000
So...

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:13.280
I'll be...

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:14.720
your butler...

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.320
Your buddy?

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:26.920
Your bestie?

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:27.840
Yep.

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:37.520
I miss the palace.

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:38.960
My palace, I miss you.

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:49.240
Nin,

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.080
what mischief
did you pull on Chakri this time?

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.160
I didn't, Dad.

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:56.320
I just told him to talk to me casually.

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.040
Finished putting things away?

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:00.440
Let's have a meal.

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:01.920
Are we having
some kind of Emmalian food?

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.800
Don't tell me...

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:05.120
Spaghetti.

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:09.000
I'm joking, come on.

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:12.160
I've made Beef Wellington, you know.

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:14.480
Whoa!

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:16.200
You've improved, haven't you?

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.950
Give me a few minutes, and we'll eat.

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.910
I went to see Vedish today.

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.160
Right now,

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.640
it must be nighttime over there,

01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:04.120
right?

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.080
You're right.

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.400
Have you eaten yet?

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:08.680
I have.

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.520
Dad made...

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.280
Beef Wellington.

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.880
Chakri even had two plates.

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:20.460
Have you stopped messing with him yet?

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:22.720
I have never done that.

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:24.240
Can I believe that, though?

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:26.360
Of course you can.

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.560
How can I mess with anyone?

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:31.040
I am...

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:33.120
sweet.

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:37.160
Yeah,

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.480
you are.

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:39.320
What?

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:44.000
Why are you making me blush, Charan?

01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:46.420
My heart's beating so fast.

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:48.520
I miss you.

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:52.560
Gosh,

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:56.360
that could take my life, you know?

01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:00.040
Do you miss me, too?

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:08.520
I don't just miss you.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:12.720
I wanna see you.

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:16.080
I wanna hug you.

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.280
I wanna...

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.040
kiss you.

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:23.840
You'll get to do it soon.

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:26.240
Sorry?

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:28.360
What did you just say?

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:29.800
I didn't catch that.

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:31.200
Nothing.

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:32.040
Nin!

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:34.000
Your parcel's here.

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:34.920
Got it.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:39.440
Ran, I'll go get my parcel now.

01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:42.680
I'll call you again tonight.

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:44.360
Okay.

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:50.000
I love you.

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.400
I've been reading the papers all day.

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:09.680
My eyes can't take it anymore.

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:12.240
You need some rest, though.

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:13.720
I'm worried about you.

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:15.840
Oh, right.

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.280
I've got an update for you.

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.440
Apparently, Charan...

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:23.480
is gonna be working
at the Ministry of Environment.

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:25.920
Charan? The Ministry of Environment?

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:27.080
Yeah,

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:30.680
but I'm not sure what his position is.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:33.400
Are you ever
coming back to Emmaly, though?

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:35.200
You've been away for so long.

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:38.240
I just got here not long ago.

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:41.000
It feels like it's been forever, though.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:44.240
Don't you wanna come back?

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.600
Well...

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:48.920
I gotta finish my degree first.

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.840
I'll think about it after that.

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:56.480
Gosh, all that effort,
and you didn't fall for it.

01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:59.720
Have you talked to Charan at all, though?

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:02.360
Well...

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:04.560
yeah, sometimes.

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:07.520
But he's been busy these days.

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:10.480
So you don't get to talk, right?

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:14.680
I should hang up, then,

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:17.040
so you can call him, okay?

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.080
Goodnight, Nin.

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:54.480
Welcome to call-back service.

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:03.200
You're up?

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:07.600
Ran!

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:17.920
I'm not dreaming, am I?

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.560
Are you really here?

01:09:27.850 --> 01:09:28.640
Yeah,

01:09:29.479 --> 01:09:30.960
I am.

01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:34.800
To see you.

01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:58.600
Ran, did you know

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.840
I couldn't reach you last night,

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:05.000
so I couldn't sleep at all?

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:09.520
I'm sorry.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.360
I was probably on the plane

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.880
when you called.

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:16.600
I wanted to surprise my dear Nin.

01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:28.840
But if you're here,

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:31.080
don't you have duties
with His Majesty anymore?

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:42.240
I'm sorry

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.600
for how unclear I was
and for making you upset.

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.240
But from now on,

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:54.600
I'm staying right here with you.

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:01.800
Something's off with you lately.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.200
What's with this wine night?

01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:06.120
Got too much time or what?

01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:08.440
I have made up my mind.

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:10.320
Made up your mind?

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:14.120
From now on, the Phithakthewas

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.480
will no longer serve as the royal guards
of the Assavadevathins.

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.400
What?

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:20.680
You mean...

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:24.320
you quit?

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:26.840
I guess that word...

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:28.680
may be right.

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:38.200
You're here, Charan?

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:40.560
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:44.080
What brings you here
to seek my presence?

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:46.000
I have come to make a humble request.

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.320
I ask that the vow
the Phithakthewas made

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:54.920
to the Assavadevathins be dissolved.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:58.720
We shall no longer serve
as your royal guards, Your Majesty.

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.240
Very well.

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:18.800
It was merely a promise
between our ancestors after all.

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:23.160
I have no intention
of holding you to it any further.

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:27.440
I am most grateful.

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:31.720
But may I ask you something?

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:36.080
Why would someone
so resolute in his duty like you

01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:38.900
choose to end the vow?

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.920
Because the time has come, Your Majesty,

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:49.920
for me to let go of my duty

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:52.760
and follow the calling of my own heart.

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:57.040
♫You've always been my only one, still♫

01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:02.280
♫Since fate first brought us together♫

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:07.880
♫I've never forgotten
any of that, like never♫

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:11.880
Don't take this as a lecture,

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.440
but remember

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:18.520
to never keep someone you love waiting.

01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:21.880
Time waits for no one, Charan.

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:27.080
♫Just for you, my one and only♫

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:28.120
I am most grateful, Your Majesty.

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:31.000
Right now, your duty is

01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:33.760
to follow your heart

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:36.240
and love him with everything you have.

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:41.080
♫Letting other voices pass by♫

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:44.400
♫Just for a few seconds,♫

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:48.040
♫My love is for no one else,♫

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:49.520
♫But you♫

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:51.520
I resigned from my duty as a royal guard

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:54.440
and ended the vow
made to the Assavadevathins.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.400
I flew across the skies

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.520
to tell you...

01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:15.480
I love you, Khanin.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:28.240
I love you, too.

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:54.160
♫So my heart's solely made♫

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:58.000
♫Just for you, my one and only♫

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:01.240
♫I'll look the other way,♫

01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:03.960
♫Ignoring every word they say♫

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:07.880
♫I'll turn a blind eye♫

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:11.440
♫And just let other voices pass by♫

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:14.680
♫Just for a few seconds,♫

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:18.600
♫My love is for no one else,♫

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:21.640
♫But you♫

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:30.440
I'm up, Dad!

01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:34.120
Can I come in?

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:35.760
Yeah.

01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:48.240
Are you surprised?

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:56.320
You knew he'd come, didn't you?

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:57.360
Well...

01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:00.360
If I told you,

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:01.800
it wouldn't be a surprise.

01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:04.060
Come on, Dad!

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:06.160
Breakfast is ready.

01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:08.280
Join us, Charan.

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:11.680
Okay, Dad.

01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:56.520
Here you go.

01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:57.920
Oh...

01:16:57.960 --> 01:16:58.560
Here.

01:16:58.600 --> 01:16:59.600
It's okay.

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:08.720
- Take your seat.
- Okay.

01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:09.480
Alright.

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:18.160
It feels just like that time
we had a meal together.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.200
But...

01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:24.720
Chakri wasn't with us.

01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:28.790
Did I miss something?

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:30.120
No.

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:32.560
It was totally different back then.

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:35.480
Nin had this scowl on his face

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:36.720
cause he didn't like Charan.

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:38.480
Look at him now.

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.640
He's glued to Charan.

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:46.320
He was trying way too hard
to be strict, you know.

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:53.880
I was just being quiet.

01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:58.800
You should take him out after this meal.

01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:01.000
Let's do that tomorrow.

01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:02.720
He must be tired from his flight.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.800
Then let's dig in

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:07.840
before the food gets cold.

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:08.600
Okay.

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:09.640
Enjoy your meal.

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:11.840
- I'm digging in.
- Here.

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:13.960
This soup is amazing.

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:15.320
Give it a taste, Charan.

01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:16.400
Okay.

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:33.000
So sweet, isn't it?

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:35.960
Is it good, Chakri?

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:07.480
Chakri!

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:08.200
Oh...

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:09.480
Oh!

01:19:12.650 --> 01:19:13.800
Your Royal Highness...

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:15.280
Oh,

01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:16.440
right...

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:17.720
I can't call you that.

01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:19.760
You're just "Nin" now.

01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:23.400
What were you doing?

01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:25.000
Look,

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:29.000
I was watching a series on iQIYI.

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:32.240
There's a lot to choose from
across different genres.

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:34.440
And the best part...

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:37.720
They've got BL series, too.

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:41.920
Are you a fan of BL series?

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:44.240
Well,

01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:45.440
I'm a big fan.

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:46.280
They're just...

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:47.600
so good

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:48.640
and heart-fluttering.

01:19:49.150 --> 01:19:50.240
Let me see.

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:51.600
I wanna watch some, too.

01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:52.840
Let my heart flutter as well.

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:54.480
Sure, here you go.

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:55.720
Check this out.

01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:00.560
Come on, Mr. Charan.

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:01.880
Watch it with us.

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:03.360
Come on.

01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:15.840
- This is so cute, Ran.
- You're right.

01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:18.080
Just as cute as you.

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:22.440
Oops...

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:25.240
This is even more heart-fluttering.

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:43.880
What are you doing?

01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:45.000
Why the long face?

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:50.000
I still have no idea where to take you.

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:54.800
Anywhere you wanna go?

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:01.880
Ran?

01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:08.800
There's one place I wanna go.

01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:12.360
Can you take me there?

01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:32.680
I missed this smell so bad.

01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:37.760
You still smell so pleasant, Nin.

01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:11.520
♫On a night when no stars grace the sky♫

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:14.880
♫And silence drifts
as the hours pass by,♫

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:20.320
♫No matter how deep the cold may bite,♫

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:26.120
♫One warm soul, standing in sight,♫

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:29.880
♫Can make the dark heart glow so bright♫

01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:34.080
♫With nothing but love
to set things right♫

01:22:34.830 --> 01:22:41.190
♫The one who could fill in
my missing part,♫

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.400
I can kiss you, too, you know.

01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:51.800
♫If you're the one
destined for my heart,♫

01:22:51.840 --> 01:23:00.200
♫Then love is near,
we're not so far apart♫

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:07.080
♫I need your love,
the only love I've longed for,♫

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:11.920
♫Just the word "love" from you,
and that's all♫

01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:14.440
♫Let me hear it, I won't ask for more♫

01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:21.080
♫I need your love, the only one I adore,♫

01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:28.080
♫My heart's been waiting
just for you, my all♫

01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:50.960
Say please.

01:26:58.880 --> 01:26:59.960
Please.

01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:05.520
I missed you, good boy.

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:19.920
No, I'm a good "babe."

01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:13.120
♫The world's a fairy tale,♫

01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:18.320
♫In your arms tonight♫

01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:21.860
♫I wish to stop this time,♫

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:27.440
♫And make you forever mine♫

01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:35.160
♫Ooh, dancing in the moonlight with you,♫

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:41.000
♫Under the stars, just us two♫

01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:49.160
♫With every beat, my heart's complete♫

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:50.600
♫You...♫

01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:55.400
♫You made my dream come true♫

01:29:56.880 --> 01:30:01.480
♫Oh, and it is only you♫

01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:07.100
♫Hold me so tight,♫

01:30:07.140 --> 01:30:11.740
♫All through the night♫

01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:46.920
After I came back,

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:49.200
I started coming here often.

01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:52.080
It's a bit far,

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:54.280
but it's peaceful right here.

01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:00.600
Nin.

01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:03.800
Yeah?

01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:28.160
This ring...

01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:30.960
You remember it, right?

01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:35.400
You told me

01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:38.520
this was your parents' wedding ring.

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:42.040
That's right.

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:45.440
And now,

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:49.280
this ring will be yours.

01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:29.560
Will you marry me?

01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:40.560
I've received permission
from His Majesty and your dad.

01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:52.280
May I put this ring on your finger?

01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:58.240
♫Do you know, my dear?♫

01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:04.000
I'll cherish and take care of you
with all I have, Khanin.

01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:09.480
I promise.

01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:16.880
♫I know we'll fly beyond with no fear♫

01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:18.400
♫Right, my dear?♫

01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:22.240
♫I'll never fade or drift away♫

01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:28.360
♫Beside you is where I'll always stay♫

01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:34.040
♫The only one I need each day,♫

01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:39.920
♫It's just you, my heart won't stray♫

01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:53.920
♫Let me just love you

01:33:54.360 --> 01:34:01.280
♫That's all I ask, to call you mine♫

01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:04.560
♫The world may shift over time♫

01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:08.200
♫Let me hold your hand so tight♫

01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:12.840
♫Through every joy and tear we find,♫

♫Like the sky, I'm by your side♫

♫Do you know what makes the sky shine,♫

01:34:25.930 --> 01:34:29.120
♫Keeping it lovely up high?♫

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:32.960
♫It's when the majestic sea
reflects the sky♫

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.600
♫Just like you and me, side by side♫

01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:43.760
♫It's enough for me, your hand in mine♫
