(Adapted from the novel
"Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.120
(Episode 17)

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.920
(If the Hate is Too Deep,
There Can Be No More Love)

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.400
Green-Eyed Monster...

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.960
is not here.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.240
Don't catch a cold.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.680
Change out of your wet clothes.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.680
You...

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.920
What's wrong?

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.600
Forget it.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.840
Come in.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.240
Let's go.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.520
Mrs. Wu, you don't want
to be hospitalized again.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.320
I'm fine now.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.320
- Earlier, I just...
- Lie down first.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.600
got confused because of the pain.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.840
Why don't we tell him?

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.120
You can't keep doing this.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.320
Xiao Chi.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.600
We can't.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.600
If I die one day,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.440
Da Qiong will only be sad
for a few days.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.520
If you tell him now,

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.880
he'll have to endure it
until the day I die.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.040
I don't want that.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.040
Mrs. Wu.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.200
Don't say that.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.160
How about this?

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.800
Stay under observation
for another night.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.760
If you're fine tomorrow,

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.880
I'll drive you home in the morning.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.000
Okay.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.920
Get some rest first.
I'll make a call.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.960
Thank you.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.600
- No worries, Mrs. Wu.
- Thank you.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.120
Are you home?

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.840
Are you about to sleep?

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.480
Okay.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.360
I have something to do tonight.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.360
I can't go home.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.440
By the way,

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.040
since I'm not around,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.520
cover yourself well
with the blanket.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.440
Good night.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.400
Why don't you go
to Wang Shuo's room...

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.440
and get some rest?

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.960
I don't think so.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.080
If Wang Shuo comes home...

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.480
and finds me in his bed,

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.520
he won't be happy.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.600
Wang Shuo won't come home.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.200
People who stay out in the rain...

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
won't come home
just because the rain stopped.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.280
Right.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.480
I shouldn't have worried about that.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.720
Wei Wei.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.360
I'm home.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.160
Where is he?

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.960
Where did you go last night?

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.000
I'm asking you
where you went last night!

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.880
Wang Shuo's house.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.560
Was it Wang Shuo...

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.360
or Wang Zhan?

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.520
- What do you think?
- Wu Suo Wei.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.080
Search for your conscience
and ask yourself.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.120
How many times
have I put up with this?

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.560
You messaged him
and I turned a blind eye to it.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.320
You said you were boxing,
but I saw you having fun.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.200
Now, you even have the guts
to sleep over at his place.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.800
Does my tolerance
mean nothing to you?

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.920
Do you think
I'm keeping you as a toy?

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.840
Do you have nothing to say now?

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.320
Since you like having fun so much,

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.680
I won't care about you anymore.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.160
Leave!

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.720
Why are you here?

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.600
Chi Cheng kicked me out...

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.080
of the house.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.760
He favors you so much.
How could he kick you out?

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.720
What?

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.800
Did Wang Shuo
become his partner again?

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.480
If you ran away from home,

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.920
you could've just walked
to the front door.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.240
Why did you come to me?

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.560
Da Wei.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.280
Did you really get kicked out?

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.880
Doesn't it prove
that Chi Cheng cares about you?

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.360
Last night,
he didn't come home all night.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.400
He must have been out
with Wang Shuo all night.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:58.840
He even got mad at me.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.520
It must be
because he's feeling guilty.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.840
You're right.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.600
He has long wanted to kick me out,

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.040
so that Wang Shuo
could move back in.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.600
No, wait.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.520
You said Wang Shuo was out
with Chi Cheng all night?

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.600
Yes.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.880
He wouldn't even give a reason.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.360
I asked him where he was going
and he said he had something to do.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.280
Wang Shuo was with me yesterday.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.040
Why did he go to see you?

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.600
He came in the middle of the night.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.640
I couldn't send away
a mentally ill person.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.520
Then where did Chi Cheng go?

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.800
I have no right...

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.320
to care about that now.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.360
He once said...

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.360
that when he
doesn't like me anymore,

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.320
he'd kick me out immediately.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.320
I didn't expect this day
to come so soon.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.840
I was planning to use Wang Zhen...

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.600
to make Chi Cheng jealous.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.000
This turned out to be an excuse
for him to kick me out.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.600
Where are you going to stay
for the next few days then?

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.920
Why don't you stay at my place?

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.720
I want to go home.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.280
I miss my mom.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:27.920
Mom.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:28.920
I'm home.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:33.880
Mom.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.040
My dear son.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.480
How did you find the time
to come home today?

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:39.920
Mom.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.200
Mom, why do I feel like...

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.600
you've lost weight again?

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.520
At my age,

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.600
this is how my illness is.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.640
Mom.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.080
With diabetes,
you must watch your diet.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.480
But you need nutrition too.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.920
Nutrition?

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.600
At my age, we just need to be full.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.960
Mom.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.840
The older we get,
the more healthy food we need.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.640
It's okay. I'll cook today.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.640
I'll make you good food.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.640
- Wait for me.
- Okay.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.560
Wait for me.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Mom.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.360
Who sent these?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Xiao Chi.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.040
He comes here very often.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.160
Lately, he comes here every day.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.320
He likes my cooking.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.520
Every time, he eats here
before going home.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.040
Look, the ingredients...

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.640
doesn't really taste good.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.800
I'm so not used to its taste.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.560
If he didn't give it
to me out of kindness,

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.160
I would have thrown it away.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.440
Mom.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.440
You can't throw it away.
It's a valuable tonic.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.680
Da Qiong.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.000
Having Xiao Chi as a friend...

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.160
is really...

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.200
your blessing.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.280
It's really...

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.000
better than getting a good wife.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.720
It's because of him...

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.280
that I don't have a wife.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.000
He's the one who's useful.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.840
Is there no signal?

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.280
Why didn't he message me?

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:57.960
Mom.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Mom.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.640
What's wrong, Mom?

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.080
I'm fine. Get me some water.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.360
Okay.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.040
Mom, have some water.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:26.960
Mom.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.360
What's wrong?

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:29.760
It's nothing.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.280
I'm so happy that you're home.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:35.120
Maybe I ate too much tonight,
so I'm suffering from indigestion.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.080
Mom, you scared me.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.640
I thought you were sick.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.320
- I'm fine.
- Mom.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.520
Let me help you to bed.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:43.880
Okay.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.440
Da Qiong.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.600
- Lie beside me too.
- Okay.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.080
Chat with me.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.440
Two days ago,

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.200
I dreamed of your dad.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.800
In my dream,

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.200
he was in the yard,

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.440
picking loquats.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.840
He's still as healthy as ever.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.480
Just like when he was young.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.280
Mom.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.440
I miss Dad too.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.000
I really want...

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.080
to see your dad soon.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.680
Mom.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.480
Don't say that.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.600
You can't curse yourself.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.840
I'm alone in the yard every day.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.680
It's so boring.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.960
There's no one to talk to.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.400
Mom.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.880
What if...

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.680
I get a loan to buy a house?

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.920
You can move in with me.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.320
That way, I can keep you company.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.880
It's just that
I have to work every day.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.960
This house is too far from work.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.800
It's too troublesome to come and go.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.600
Silly boy.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.080
You've only earned some money,

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.280
but you're already showing off.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.520
Save it.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.920
Buy a house when you have the money.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.240
However, even if you buy a house,

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.600
I won't live there.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.960
I can't bear to part
with this place.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.280
I can't bear to part with your dad.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.680
I've been living here
for over 40 years.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.960
I want to die here.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.440
Now, I am...

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.960
just hoping...

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.760
you'd get me a daughter-in-law soon.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.240
Give me a grandson
or a granddaughter.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.240
Yes.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.240
Mom.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.480
We'll have a big, fat baby...

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.400
who's soft to hug.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.880
When he grows up,

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.920
he'll run...

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.280
around you...

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.680
and call you,

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.160
"Grandma."

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.200
Yes.

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.000
I'm waiting for that.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.280
You're back.

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.080
So...

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.680
did you miss me?

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:10.760
No.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.560
I almost forgot what you look like.

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.320
You didn't miss me?

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.240
Didn't we just have
a video call two days ago?

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.320
Do you want me
to help you remember...

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:24.320
how it was back then?

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.040
Shut up.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.480
There's something
I want to tell you.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.360
What is it?

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.040
Seven years ago,

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.080
before Wang Shuo went abroad,

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.120
he had to go to the hospital
almost every few days.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.160
How did you get...

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.400
these medical records?

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.080
Don't care about that.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.280
Let me ask you.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.000
Did you know that he's sick?

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.040
No.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.080
It's such a big deal.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.120
How could you not know?

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.480
Back then,

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.800
I just remembered
they'd always fight and make up.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.120
Every time they fought,

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.400
Chi Cheng would come over
for a drink.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.160
When I asked him,
he wouldn't tell me anything.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.560
Who knows
what was going on back then?

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.160
You're so calculating.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.760
Why didn't you use that?

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.120
I became calculating...

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.880
because I've been fighting
with Chi Cheng all these years.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.680
Wang Shuo is really something.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.800
Once he left,
you and Chi Cheng matured.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.400
Yes.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.760
I have to ask Wang Shuo...

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.520
what happened back then.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.520
I wanted to ask him last time,
but I had to go on a business trip.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.480
I have to ask him clearly this time.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.240
Why are you asking Wang Shuo?

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.720
Weren't you involved?

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.240
I...

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.200
I…

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.520
I drank too much that day.
I was so drunk.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.760
When I woke up the next morning,

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.920
Wang Shuo was lying next to me.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.320
I was freaking dumbfounded.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:55.800
I called Chi Cheng.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.320
He was angry, so he didn't pick up.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.960
A few days later,

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.200
Wang Shuo left.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:01.880
Even if I wanted to confront him,

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.160
I couldn't find him.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.920
You...

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.280
You don't think
that I don't go to Wang Shuo...

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.960
because I like Chi Cheng, right?

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.840
Do you have a heart at all?

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.720
In that video call two days ago,
you even...

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.360
I'm sorry.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.960
Young Master Guo.
Please, Young Master Guo.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.320
Go use your calculative mind...

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.720
to the fullest.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.760
I've been waiting too long...

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.600
for this case to be closed.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.400
Fine.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.480
I'll close the case for you now.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:37.560
All right?

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.840
You and Wu Suo Wei haven't seen
each other for a week or two, right?

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.520
He spent the night with someone.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.720
I'm just ignoring him
for a few days.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.560
It's not too much.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.560
You didn't teach him a lesson?

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.960
If I didn't kick him out,

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.840
he'd be lying in the hospital.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.160
He's getting bolder.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.160
You need to discipline him.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.640
He doesn't have the guts.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.080
He just wants to infuriate me.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.840
This place...

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.400
is not far from Wu Suo Wei's
family house, right?

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.760
Why don't we pick him up
along the way?

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.920
Forget it.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.640
I didn't dare
to let him go home before.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.560
Now that he's home,

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.720
let him spend time with his mom.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.200
No, wait.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.240
Why didn't you dare
to let him go home?

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.440
Why are you here?

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.400
Explain this to me.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:10.920
What's going on?

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.640
I'm sick.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.680
I woke up late today
and didn't take my medicine.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.880
I might have an episode
and bite you to death.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.600
That's enough.

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.680
Stop pretending in front of me.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.120
I've shown you enough respect.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.280
You've slandered me
for seven years...

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.440
and I didn't say anything.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.080
Stop this.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.560
Why are you so irresponsible?

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.520
You're bullying me
because I'm not a woman.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.280
You slept with me,

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.320
yet I can't bring a kid
to prove it to you?

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:42.920
That medicine is fake, right?

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.280
Stop taking it.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.800
It's messing with your brain.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.600
Since you think
we didn't sleep together back then,

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.080
why did you let me
frame you for seven years?

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.680
This is called...

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.520
going with the flow.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.200
If you didn't leave,

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.920
why would Chi Cheng and I...

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.800
stay connected
even after seven years?

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.600
There's an idiom that goes...

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.360
"Love breeds hatred".

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.040
I want to try
the other way around...

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.000
to see if hate...

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.720
can breed love.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:24.880
You...

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.600
You really have a thing
for Chi Cheng.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.440
If I hadn't set you up
to sleep with me back then,

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.440
the one who slept with you
would've been Chi Cheng.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.040
So you admit it.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.800
That you set me up.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.720
Darn it.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.960
I let you trick me again.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.360
But I'm curious.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.080
What makes you think
I have a thing...

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.000
for Chi Cheng?

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.320
He was in bed with me,

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.200
yet he was calling your name.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.920
That night,
he kept calling "Cheng Yu".

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.360
I wanted to put you...

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.600
in a pan...

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.680
and fry you.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.240
Are you crazy?

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.680
He was freaking drunk back then.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.000
Do you believe...

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.400
someone's nonsense when drunk?

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.800
Even when he wasn't drunk,
all he could see was you.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000
That's nonsense.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.440
Because of this ridiculous idea,

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.120
you set me up and framed me.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.800
And you've implicated yourself,

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.480
yet you don't want
to clean your name.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.040
Is it worth it?

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.160
You won't understand.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.160
It's very worth it.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.320
Wei Wei.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.320
Why are you here?

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.520
I brought Green-Eyed Monster back
to see his dad.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.120
So this is your love nest.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:36.240
(Always happy with you
all four seasons)

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.480
You don't smile much
when you take photos nowadays.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.560
I've never smiled much.

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.360
I remember in our past videos,

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.120
you were smiling
in every single one.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.080
By the way,

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.360
a few days ago,
Wu Suo Wei went to my house.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.720
He's a nosy guy.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.160
He touched my computer.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.800
I think...

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.040
he saw those videos.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.280
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.760
Wang Shuo.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.400
What exactly do you want?

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.560
To have fun.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.480
Seeing you two fight makes me happy.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.120
Darn you!

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:35.800
Go on.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.720
Don't think there are still
feelings in our relationship...

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.720
by how much I hurt you.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.240
Let me tell you.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.480
I only harbor respect for you now...

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.720
in waiting for you for six years.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.640
Listen carefully.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.400
I said six years,

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.040
not seven.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.200
Since last year,

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:16.840
this...

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.240
doesn't belong to you anymore.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.720
Do you really
only have respect for me?

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.360
How many six years
does one have in a lifetime?

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.480
Including the three years
we were together,

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.160
that's 10 years, Chi Cheng.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.920
Let me ask you, Chi Cheng.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.520
Can you remove...

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.200
these 10 years...

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.640
from your heart completely?

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.520
And how many memories do we have...

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.440
in that house in the suburbs?

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.600
You lived there for so many years.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.760
To keep our snakes,

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.120
you endured the heat of
over 30 degrees Celsius every day.

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.360
Can you forget that kind of memory?

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:20.880
I can't.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.000
But it's just a scar.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.480
I can see it,

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.240
which can remind me of the past.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.680
But it's just a scar
that remains on my body.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.200
It won't hurt anymore.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.880
They say love breeds hate.

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:06.960
But if the hate is too deep,

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.960
there can be no more love.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.360
I'm going to bed.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.280
Let yourself out.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.080
I have one last favor
to ask of you then.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:33.800
Tell me.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.480
Right now,

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.200
in front of me,

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.400
say you don't love me anymore.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.960
Will you only understand
if I say that out loud?

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.480
I want you to say it yourself.

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:56.720
Once you say it,

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.080
I won't pester you anymore.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.200
Say this.

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:11.000
"I, Chi Cheng,"

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:13.600
"don't love you anymore,"

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.480
"Wang Shuo."

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.480
I...

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.600
I've been waiting for you.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.080
I've been busy with work
in the past few days.

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.280
I'm staying here
for a couple of days.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.640
Why don't you stay at Chi Cheng's?

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.760
You haven't made up yet?

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:27.840
Milk Tea.

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.840
It's been days.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.360
He hasn't sent me a single message.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.120
Who knows where he is?

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.640
He must be hanging out
with Wang Shuo...

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:42.640
and forgot about me.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.520
If he comes to you,

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:47.720
will you go home with him?

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.080
Even if he kneels here
and kowtows to me twice,

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.120
I won't forgive him.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.440
You have to remember...

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:55.600
what you said today.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:00.560
Regarding Wang Shuo,

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.840
I asked Cheng Yu for information
a couple of days ago.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000
What did he say?

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.600
Wang Shuo admitted
that he set this up.

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.600
He and Cheng Yu...

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.000
didn't sleep together at all.

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.240
What?

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.000
He's sick.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.360
He is indeed.

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.560
Wait. People who are sick
in the head don't act like this.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.760
I suspect he had an ulterior motive.

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.320
I'm going to find out...

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.600
and let Chi Cheng know.

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:29.600
But we only have
Guo Cheng Yu as the witness.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.360
If Chi Cheng believed him,

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.400
he would have a long time ago.

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.320
We need more evidence.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.400
Wang Shuo left so many videos
of the three of them.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.320
He must have other evidence.

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:40.760
I'm sure I can find it.

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:45.840
Forget it. Have some milk tea.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.440
Tell me.

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.360
Wang Shuo has been back
for half a year.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:52.840
What has he been doing?

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.760
Did he just watch you
and Chi Cheng being all lovey-dovey?

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.360
I don't believe he'd do that.

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.120
He must be a masochist to like...

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.560
seeing the person he loves
with his love rival.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.000
He must have been
secretly scheming...

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.440
to get Chi Cheng back.

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.040
Then the love rival
he should investigate the most...

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:10.080
is you.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.520
Speaking of which,

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.120
he seemed very interested
in my name.

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:19.640
He asked me a few times
why this is my name.

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.640
- Your name?
- Yes.

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.000
- "Wu Suo Wei"?
- Yes.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.880
- Does he know why I changed it?
- Does he know why you changed it?

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:49.480
That means...

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.320
he knows about Yue Yue and me.

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.880
Since he knows about it,

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.320
why didn't he expose you?

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.000
I'm sure
it's not the right time yet.

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.080
Da Wei,

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.760
will you just go along
with his plan?

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.080
At this point,

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.640
I have no choice but to do that.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:16.640
Besides, no one knows...

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:17.960
how things will turn out.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.360
Have a seat first.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.960
When Mr. Wu is done,
I'll go get him.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:36.440
Mr. Wu is here.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:37.960
Mr. Wu.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.920
This is Ms. Yue.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.680
Her company is undergoing renovation
at its new address.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.040
She's here to pick some ready-made
installations and decorations.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:45.920
Okay.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:47.880
It's been a while.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.600
Yes, it's been a while.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.040
You know each other, Mr. Wu?

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.200
Yes.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.360
I changed jobs.

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.520
I'm the CEO's secretary.

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.320
The company entrusted me
with the renovation.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.560
Since your company
is in this business,

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:01.600
I came to take a look...

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.800
and visit you as well.

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:05.760
Have a seat.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.920
Your timing is perfect.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.200
How have you been?

00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:22.720
I'm good.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000
What about you?

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:25.400
Me?

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:26.880
How should I put it?

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:27.960
I'm okay.

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.040
Xiao Lin.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.160
Bring our company's
product brochure...

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:34.280
and let Ms. Yue take a look.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.480
All right. Wait a moment.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:38.560
"Ms. Yue"?

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.520
I'm not quite used...

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:41.960
to hearing that from you.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.240
After all, we were close.

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:46.320
You deserve to be addressed
with respect.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:50.920
They're all here.

00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.480
Take a look first.

00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:53.720
These are the decorations.

00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:56.960
Take your pick.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.400
Tell Xiao Lin if you like anything.

00:34:58.480 --> 00:34:59.520
Take it as a gift from me.

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.560
I can't accept that.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.360
There's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.480
Well,

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.160
are you still with him?

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.280
Ms. Yue.

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:17.280
That's my personal matter.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:18.920
Don't ask about it.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.440
Xiao Lin.

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.880
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.120
- This is my...
- Mr. Lin.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:27.000
If I need anything,
I'll make an order based on this.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.480
- I'll get going.
- The brochure.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:30.840
Your bag. You forgot your bag too.

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.800
- Thank you.
- Take care.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.800
Wu Qi Qiong.

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.360
I didn't expect you
to be so heartless.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:41.920
Ms. Yue.

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.920
We already have nothing
to do with each other anymore.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.800
Is there anything else
you need, Ms. Yue?

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:46.960
If there's nothing else,

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:48.560
please leave.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.960
I'll get going then.
I'll visit you again next time.

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.320
This way, please.

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.360
Why is she here again?

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.520
Her new company's renovating.

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:21.600
She's here to pick out decorations.

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.360
Doesn't she know our relationship?

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.160
She's purchasing things from you?

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.120
Wang Shuo knows about us too.

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:31.320
He comes here to purchase stuff too.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.960
If a love rival makes a purchase,
it's always on the house.

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.360
I think she knows about this...

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.560
and came to get free stuff.

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:40.920
You're so generous.

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.080
Yes.

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.760
I'm generous,
unlike some petty people.

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.800
When they're angry,
they don't get in touch for days...

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.520
and vehemently criticize
the moment we meet.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.880
They even complain
that I'm generous to my love rivals.

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.160
No wonder I've been sneezing
in the past few days.

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.320
So you've been scolding me
behind my back.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.000
Could you hear me scolding you
behind your back?

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.080
You've probably been fooling around
in the past few days...

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.520
that you have forgotten about me.

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:11.840
Who did I fool around with?

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.120
Be honest.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.320
Did you miss me in the past 10 days?

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:17.520
No.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:19.040
I think Guo Cheng Yu
didn't miss you either.

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:20.560
You're so stubborn.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.800
Do you want to die?

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.120
Do you have a death wish?

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:25.640
I'll deal with you when we get home.

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.120
A few days ago,

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:33.760
I went to see my mom.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.320
She looked so haggard.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:41.480
Maybe...

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.720
she has...

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:46.560
been tired lately.

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:52.640
Thank you.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.040
You're always there
to keep her company...

00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:58.840
and even eat with her.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.560
Now, you know you should thank me.

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.640
Where was it when you were
being dramatic the other day?

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:16.480
My mom...

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.120
is prone to miscarriages.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.360
When she was pregnant with me,

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.720
she already had two miscarriages.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:27.440
When she had me, she was already 38.

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:29.920
Many of her friends' kids...

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.520
bought houses for their moms.

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.080
Some of their grandkids...

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.920
are already in kindergarten.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.520
I'm just starting my career now.

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.160
Sometimes, I really feel
like I don't have enough time.

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.920
Now, the company's business...

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.600
is on track.

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.480
Don't worry.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.720
I can still handle
the company's matters well.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:58.960
You...

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.680
should go home more often
and spend more time with your mom.

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.440
You've always been...

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.480
so tolerant of me.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.200
What's the matter?

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:19.320
Do you want me...

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:20.960
to be petty with you?

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.320
Say what you want to say.

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:40.760
After I finish this cigarette,

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.760
you won't get the chance to do so.
