00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:35.451


00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.200
Come join my fan club!

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.840
I'm in a PK battle with Xiaojian.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.759
Thank you to "Mom Love Me Again"

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.800
for the Carnival gift. Spread out.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.320
Three, two, one, dance.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.040
Thank you.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.760
Hit follow

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.039
and give me red hearts!

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.360
Come on.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.800
Guys, let's cheer her on.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.880
Bunny girl! Bunny girl!

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.680
Guys,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.120
thank you.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.000
Thank you for the support!

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.880
Guys,

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.280
I'm going all out for you.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.280
Go greet Anran first.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.520
If she's not mad when she sees you,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.560
wave me over.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.720
Got it, don't worry.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.440
Go, quick.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.120
You go first.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.040
[- Good morning.]
[- These three, right?]

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.280
Morning.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.360
[Quick, come here.]

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.600
Anran, I'm back.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.840
How's your father-in-law doing?

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.720
Much better.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.560
I'm here to apologize.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.280
You gave me

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.080
such a great opportunity,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.840
but I failed you.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.120
I caused you a lot of trouble.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.080
I'm sorry.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.200
These yellow roses are for you.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.280
They mean "I'm sorry".

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.200
It's fine.

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.000
Don't worry about it.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.640
You're married,

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.640
and family comes before career.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.880
I totally understand.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.200
But I checked the almanac today.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.079
Yellow is unlucky for my career.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.200
Xiaohe, take these flowers

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.920
to the front desk

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.079
for the receptionist.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.680
[Okay.]

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.079
Actions speak louder.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.400
I'll take your assistant

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.120
as an apology.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.320
Why not send him to me?

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:50.960
- Thanks.
- Liu Bo, right?

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.000
Yes.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.480
You're cute.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.200
Thank you.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.080
Yellow is unlucky for me too.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.760
But yellow's

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.240
pretty good for me.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.240
Can you learn

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.920
from stone-faced Xiaohe?

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.680
You smile all the time.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.000
We look totally unprofessional.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.480
Okay, I will.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.600
Bo,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.760
if Anran tries to poach you,

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:21.399
will you go?

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.320
You hesitated,

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.920
seriously?

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.760
I'd never go.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.240
I'm absolutely loyal.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.680
I swear I won't go.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.320
You'd better.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.680
Remember what I've done for you.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.960
Hi, guys,

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.240
I'm back.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.280
Did you hear?

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.440
Ms. Liao's account

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.320
got banned.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.760
And Anran's behind it.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.680
Watch what you say.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.640
I'm this close to her.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.520
Okay, okay.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.680
Listen up,

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.720
we're at a

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.120
life-or-death moment here.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.680
We're in the same situation.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.560
I've offended Anran.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.159
She didn't even take the flowers.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.240
So what

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.280
do we do now?

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.840
Fight. What else can I do?

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.720
Close the door.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.480
Okay.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.040
Guys.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.240
♪Beat the drums and sing along.♪

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.880
♪I'm riding my horse across the hill.♪

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.360
♪Shalima, Shalima, Shali...♪

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.600
What are you doing? Cursing?

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.480
I'm not. I'm singing.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.920
What's that word?

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.680
What are you doing?

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.680
Close it.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.560
Come help me out.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.400
It's hot today

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.760
and you're wearing all these layers?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.080
I need to put this on now.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.840
It's a knockoff

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.880
I bought somewhere else.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.560
Have some water first.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.240
No time.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.600
Hurry up.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.480
What is this?

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.840
I bought this knockoff

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.840
on another platform.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.040
I need to wear it and look terrible,

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.240
so the stuff in Anran's livestream

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.920
looks authentic.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.440
That way everyone will buy from her.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.520
Isn't that cheating?

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.960
How is this cheating?

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.880
It's to educate consumers.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.520
Putting it on is like stuffing a sausage.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.040
Stop joking around.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.640
Is it right?

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.200
Put your arm through here.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.240
It took me hours to secure those layers.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.240
Now you've made me

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.480
look like I've got a big tumor.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.600
The layers aren't arranged properly.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.040
No, it's fine.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.520
Doesn't this look okay?

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.040
Wait, wait.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.560
I look like

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.840
a pregnant earthworm.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.040
Here, stuff some inside.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.680
What are these?

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.480
How dare you?

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.680
As long as it works.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.520
Looks perfect.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.120
You sure?

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.240
But why does it seem...

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.560
Is it ugly?

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.480
Not quite human.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.080
Then what?

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.720
You know, a big disc

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.880
on the bottom,

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:10.840
spinning around,

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.600
with a little point on top.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.560
Get over here!

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.480
Wait, wait.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.200
What?

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:15.680
I didn't say anything.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.240
Where are you going?

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:16.760
What did I even say?

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.080
Stop there.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.760
You try it on.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.960
Come here and try it.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.680
I really can't.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.520
Let go, let go.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.680
Such a coward.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.560
This is surely going to work.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:26.560
Hurry up.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.000
I need to film a video.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.440
Anran, thank you so much.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.280
It's raining and I

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.520
couldn't get a ride.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.840
Over 100 people were in line.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.520
No worries. It's on my way.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.360
I got your car floor mat

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:57.840
all wet.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.760
It's fine, really.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.320
I'll clean it later.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.520
Just don't send me flowers anymore.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:05.800
Waste of money.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.520
I feel awful about last time.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.840
I'm sincerely sorry.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.720
I can tell you're sincere,

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.800
and I see your attitude.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.480
You put yourself out there in those videos.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.680
I appreciate your effort.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.680
Going from

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.160
TV host

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.040
to where you are now

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.440
isn't easy.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.159
I think you have potential.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.400
Anran, if you could

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.400
give me another chance,

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.760
I definitely won't let you down.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:41.919
Honestly,

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:44.640
I'd like to help you out,

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.000
but not right now.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.080
For at least the next week,

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.120
I need to livestream with Xiaojian.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.040
Since you

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.120
stood me up last time,

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:53.880
I

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.800
owe him

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.960
this favor.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.160
I understand.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.120
We'll find another time.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.480
I'll schedule

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.200
a good slot for you.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.480
Okay, got it.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.880
I can wait however long.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.640
Don't feel pressured.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.960
Are you a bit scared of me?

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:18.800
No.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.920
Because of rumors in the company?

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:26.880
No.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.160
You heard that

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.480
I took down Ms. Liao, right?

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:35.880
I don't believe

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.360
you haven't heard about this.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.200
Just be honest.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.480
It's all rumors.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.040
They're making this up.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.240
Every company's like this.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.240
You probably won't

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.000
believe me,

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.640
but this actually

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.840
has nothing to do with me.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.960
I was falsely blamed.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.400
[But]

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.680
[Ms. Liao got in trouble]

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.200
[when she was battling with Xiaojian.]

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.320
Xiaojian's close with me.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.760
So everyone at the company and online

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.040
started spreading

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.280
[rumors that I orchestrated it.]

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.360
[How can I be this capable?]

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.040
If I could predict things that well,

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:18.920
I'd just be a fortune teller.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.160
[I understand. I never]

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.040
[believed it anyway.]

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.360
Every company

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.680
is like this.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.040
Everyone echoes

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.240
the rumors

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.880
and adds fake details.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.560
[It was the same]

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.240
[at the TV station.]

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.280
[They even said I]

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.240
[had connections.]

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.480
As long as you don't take it to heart,

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.040
those words can't hurt you.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.520
I don't believe them.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.240
Good that you understand.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:47.640
Xiaohe,

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.000
this bag is from a brand partner.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.200
The style's very young. You can have it.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.440
Thank you.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:56.880
By the way,

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.240
the meeting notes from two days ago,

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.640
[did you send them?]

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:01.680
Let me check.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:03.640
[Check?]

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.440
[If you don't push them,]

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:07.840
[they'll just]

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.840
[drag forever.]

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.520
You're my assistant.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.040
You should be tracking these things.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.880
Why do I always have to remind you?

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.480
You told me to

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.240
verify the product selection.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.240
Can't the two tasks be done together?

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.160
[In our line of work,]

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.040
[you need to learn to]

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:29.880
[multitask.]

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.200
How many times do I

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.040
have to teach you?

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.480
Look at Ran's assistant,

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.320
handsome,

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.240
capable and cheerful.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.040
He is quite

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:40.680
something.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:41.520
Where'd you find

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.680
such a great helper?

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.480
Really.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.000
Bo and I don't have

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.040
much experience.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:46.600
We're figuring

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.760
things out as we go.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.960
And we make

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.680
plenty of mistakes.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:50.880
Xiaohe has

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.880
many strengths too. She...

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.240
What strengths? Be specific.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.600
She's good.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.480
What's good?

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.160
Tell me.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.240
She's pretty.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.760
Much more attractive than Bo.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:10.680
[Bo is average.]

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:12.840
[Alright, don't]

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:13.640
[force it.]

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.960
I find you quite amusing.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.640
Ran?

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.320
What?

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:29.880
What happened to your room?

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.120
It's a complete mess.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.680
[Looks like a pigsty.]

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.960
It's not that bad.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.320
[Stuff piled everywhere.]

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.240
What is all this?

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.560
Why so many pillows?

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.760
What a waste.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.800
Then just use them.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.320
If one gets old, just replace it.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.480
[Why would I need so many pillows?]

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.040
Listen, your

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:47.880
father-in-law's in hospital.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.160
Get up, get dressed,

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.040
[and go visit him.]

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.520
He's almost fine.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.760
There are so many people with him.

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.000
I can't do anything...

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.920
You don't even sleep at night.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:56.960
Making all that noise.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.200
You're getting

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.120
[more...]

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.480
I'm sorry. I'll move out soon.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.440
I'm already looking for a place.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.160
[I'll definitely]

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.240
[clean this room up.]

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.480
You're moving out?

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.440
I'm looking for a place.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.160
How could you

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.640
not discuss this with me?

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.920
Isn't that what I'm doing now?

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.840
Aren't you just notifying me?

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.840
If you move out, what about

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:18.520
Yudong?

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.840
Of course he's coming with me.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:20.920
I won't leave him here.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:21.240
[Wait,]

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.880
isn't he going back to Canada?

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.920
After his dad got sick,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.200
he seems fine,

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.800
but he's really worried inside.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:31.320
[He's not going.]

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.840
And now he's going to

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.480
find a job. It's fine.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.560
Any progress in the job hunt?

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.800
It's not another

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.880
ProFix gig, is it?

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:44.880
No, it's not.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.400
[Mom, Mom.]

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:45.880
This time...

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.560
Nothing's confirmed yet.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.280
I'll tell you

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.160
when it is.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.040
Alright. Whatever the job is,

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.200
as long as you have one.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.320
[I just think]

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.960
[it's good you're staying in China.]

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.880
You two can be together,

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:57.640
and our whole family

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.760
can be together.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:13:59.920
It's great.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:00.360
Yeah.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.040
But you don't have to

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.120
move out.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.600
If I don't move, I'll drive you crazy.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.280
You were just complaining.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.440
[It's fine. Just buy]

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.240
[a pair of]

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.480
earplugs online.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.360
I'll plug my ears

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.520
and you can live with us.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.280
It'd make me a terrible daughter.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:12.960
It's okay.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:13.920
Go change.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:14.640
We need to leave.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.240
I did. I'm waiting for you.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.160
For me? Why didn't you say so?

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.680
Don't forget to

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.000
take the soup with you.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.440
I told you to get up.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.040
But you didn't listen.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.080
Now you're scolded.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.680
We're being so inconsiderate.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.360
Mom, don't worry.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.440
We may be moving out,

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.680
[but we're always around.]

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:29.240
[If anything]

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.120
[breaks down at home,]

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.320
[just call me and I'll be right back.]

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.680
[Things don't break that often.]

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:33.320
Dad, what

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.360
are you doing in there?

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.680
I'm in a hurry.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.120
[He already went out.]

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.200
[- Out?]
[- He's not in there.]

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.400
Can the price go any lower?

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.040
Ma'am,

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.600
the landlord has reduced

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.120
it several times.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.200
No room to go lower.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:50.760
Then keep looking.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.960
See if there are other places.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:52.640
Try again.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:53.440
We've seen nearly

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.760
all houses around here

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:55.720
that fit your budget

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.400
and requirements.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.720
I just don't believe...

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:00.880
If not, forget it.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.560
Just stay at your mom's.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.360
If you really

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.240
hate that room,

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.240
I'll fix it up for you.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.080
Stay there for a bit.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.520
How long would renovation take?

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.160
Very simple. Just new wallpaper

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.400
and a few pieces of furniture.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.240
Two days tops.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.280
But there'll still be formaldehyde.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.160
We'd be living in...

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:13.680
Sir, Ma'am.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.560
I'll use eco-friendly materials.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.520
If you have concerns

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.680
about the budget,

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.160
I do have

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.080
a property that

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.160
fits your requirements.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.880
But it's a bit special.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:23.560
If you want to see it...

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.480
We don't need it.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.200
Wait, we do.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.840
- Let's see it.
- Let's go.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:27.920
Why didn't you mention it earlier?

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.240
I really can renovate.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.280
Please come in.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.240
This place is pretty nice.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.760
It used to be a model unit.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.040
Yeah.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:40.720
Hello?

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:41.680
It's spacious.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.320
I thought you

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.360
weren't coming back.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:43.960
Who's that?

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:44.480
No, nothing.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.040
Are you planning

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.120
to renovate now?

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.480
[House viewing. Future neighbor here!]

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.040
[Sorry.]

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.320
This place looks expensive.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.400
This won't work.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.040
Haven't we been making money lately?

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:55.840
- We can afford it.
- Let's keep looking.

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.280
As for the price...

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.560
It's not too high.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.520
Is it in our range?

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.280
Yes, yes.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.160
Good.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.520
The interior is about 150 square meters.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.720
A couple

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.680
bought it as their

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.400
future wedding home,

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.440
[but they later went abroad.]

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.280
So they never renovated it.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.600
It's still in the model

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:13.680
unit condition.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.600
The lighting's nice.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.040
Look, this spot would be

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.240
perfect for my workspace.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:17.920
Look,

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:18.920
good natural light.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.720
Right, right.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.040
What are you looking for?

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:23.840
What's wrong?

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.120
Can I use the bathroom

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:25.680
here?

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.520
Right now you need the bathroom?

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:28.240
Where is it?

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:28.920
There, there.

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.880
Okay, give it to me.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:30.880
Hurry, go.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.680
This is a mini bar, right?

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.320
Exactly.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.920
Having a drink here would

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.640
feel pretty classy.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.280
Excuse me.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.400
This bathroom has no door?

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.160
It's a model unit.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.080
For display purposes we didn't install doors.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:45.960
You could...

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:46.520
This one too?

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.600
So none of these rooms have doors,

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.440
[right?]

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.360
[You go ahead.]

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.680
We'll look over here.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.440
No one's watching you. Just go.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.200
This is the bedroom, right?

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:54.880
Yeah, it's

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:55.640
the master bedroom.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.240
No door either?

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.040
Yes.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.200
It's quite spacious.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.560
Yes, and it faces south.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.240
South-facing, right?

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.240
Exactly.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.720
[A walk-in closet too?]

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:07.319
[Yes.]

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:08.160
[A large one.]

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.160
[So another bathroom]

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:10.359
is here.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.760
All connected.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:13.359
[This is the secondary bedroom.]

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.640
[Oh, another bedroom?]

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.440
[Nice, nice.]

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.440
[The layout...]

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.280
[Everything's fine,]

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:21.240
[except, since it's a model unit,]

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.160
[the pipes and wiring]

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.119
are a bit

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:26.040
not great.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:26.720
Pipes and wiring?

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.440
Yes, right.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.600
Sorry.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.240
The pipes and wiring

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.360
definitely have issues.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.360
Model units

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.640
look good,

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.800
but the actual quality is poor.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.040
Let's check out other places.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.240
Just minor issues.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.960
Replace the pipes and it'll be fine.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.520
Hold on, I need to take this call.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.200
Sorry.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:44.520
I'm viewing a house now.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:45.520
Alright, I'm

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:46.360
leaving now.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:46.960
Okay.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.200
Well,

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.760
I really like this place,

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:50.920
especially

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.440
the natural light and layout.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:52.880
Right.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:53.720
There are still some issues, though.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.240
I will

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.920
contact you online, okay?

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.360
We'll discuss the rental

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.480
details later.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.240
But if there are

00:17:59.240 --> 00:17:59.880
any problems,

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.640
you have to tell

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.520
my husband honestly, okay?

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:01.960
Don't worry, ma'am.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:02.880
Then you handle the rest with him.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:03.680
Take this.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:04.880
See you at the hospital tonight

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.040
and behave yourself.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.280
[I gotta go now.]

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.320
[So, keep in touch?]

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.040
Okay, I'll call you.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:09.680
[Okay.]

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:14.960
Sir, sir?

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:16.520
Settled then?

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.720
Should we do the deposit now?

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.320
I don't handle the money.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:36.480
[Sign here.]

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:38.920
[The patient can be discharged tomorrow.]

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.000
[Make sure he takes his meds on time]

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.360
[and watch closely]

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.560
[for any side effects.]

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:44.680
[Also,]

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:45.560
[pay]

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.520
[special attention to his diet.]

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:47.280
Thanks.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.760
[Does he like heavy, salty food?]

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.280
[Does he eat organ meats?]

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.600
Probably not.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.280
[How's his sleep?]

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:58.440
[Does he snore?]

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.640
I'm not sure. As for snoring,

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.280
maybe not.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:03.920
[Does he smoke?]

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:05.520
What?

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:06.960
[Does he smoke?]

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.040
[Smoking. Does he smoke or not?]

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.480
I don't think so.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.560
[Wait, are you actually his son?]

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:17.400
Yeah.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.320
Enjoy the feast.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.280
Help yourselves.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.000
Come on, come on.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.040
Cheers. Cheers.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.040
Thank you, thank you.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:30.680
Congrats. Congrats.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.080
Thanks.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.000
Wish you happy years together.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:32.880
Congratulations.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:33.640
Bottom's up.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:34.840
Congrats, Mr. Fu.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.600
What a wonderful day.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.320
Guys, eat and drink.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.480
Those two have been

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.880
close since they were kids.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:40.320
Yeah.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:40.800
For sure.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:41.200
That's right.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.720
Now their parents are married.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.080
Best friends becoming real brothers.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.240
Come on.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.640
Fu's here. Let's toast to him.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.480
Let's drink to the newlyweds.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.640
Yongjun, best wishes.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.240
Thank you.

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.040
Congratulations.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.760
Help yourselves and enjoy the party.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:53.880
Thank you all. Thanks.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.040
Let's drink.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.360
That's a lot. Don't get drunk.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.040
Mr. Fu.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.040
Okay, thank you. Cheers.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.240
Xiaoyan, congratulations.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.200
Thank you, thank you.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.240
You look stunning today.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.440
We have to leave now.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:08.960
Okay, okay.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.720
Bye.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.320
Thank you so much.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:12.760
Alright.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:14.400
Yudong, let me help you.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:14.960
No need, Ms. Wang.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:15.840
I've got it.

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.280
Ms. Wang, you look like

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.200
you're twenty today.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.080
Your false eyelash fell off.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:28.480
Just kidding

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:30.720
What's wrong?

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.400
You mean Yudong?

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:36.520
He's fine.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.560
He's actually happy.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:39.640
He just hasn't fully

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.720
processed it yet.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.040
Am I being

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:43.960
a nuisance to you?

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.560
Don't say that.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.440
This is wonderful news!

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:49.760
You have no idea how relieved I feel

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.040
now that you're married off.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.640
So mouthy.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.800
You guys had enough to drink?

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.080
Have some more, come on.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.960
Yudong, not leaving yet?

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:15.360
Here.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.000
Be careful.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:17.680
Take it slow.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:21.840
Yudong.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.160
Everybody, hop in!

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:24.800
Quickly!

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.040
Happy wedding!

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.960
Off to the bridal chamber!

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.440
Everyone, get in now!

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.200
Hurry!

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.080
Zhang Ran's mom

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.320
made this soup specially for you.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:54.560
Simmered all night.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.200
Drink it while it's hot.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.280
Thank you.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.120
Yudong, you're here.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:09.840
Xiaoyan.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.000
Have a seat.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.280
Your dad's been talking about you.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.280
With you here,

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.640
he looked all ruddy.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:18.720
The doctor says

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.280
he can be discharged tomorrow.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.480
Really?

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.200
Great! We can go home

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.280
and rest properly.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.880
Didn't you want chicken soup?

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.040
It's ready. I brought it for you.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.720
Yudong, have some.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:34.880
Your dad insists you do.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.000
No, no, I'm fine.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.480
You two share it.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.200
I'm gonna go outside.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.080
You two have it.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.080
Starving, aren't you?

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:50.960
Am I interrupting you?

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.360
Not at all.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.920
Alright, eat up then.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.640
The layout of that apartment is superb,

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.480
great natural light too.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.200
Feels bright and spacious.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:14.880
Most importantly,

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.960
close to where I work.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.280
Not far away from yours too.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:18.640
That's wonderful.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.640
But did you scour

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.600
inside that place?

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.040
They say rental units often

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.600
have lots of minor issues.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:24.360
Doesn't matter.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.280
Fu Yudong can fix anything.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.600
Fixing things around the house

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.480
is his specialty.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.640
Not just our own,

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.040
he helps the neighbors too.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.400
Just talking about the rental.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.320
He fixed the neighbors' stuff too.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:34.640
Really?

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.120
A real handyman.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.800
Visiting hours are over. Gotta go.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:37.600
Time to head home.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:38.560
Alright.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.440
Okay, Dad, Mom,

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.200
we'll be off now.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.400
Rest well, Dad.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:42.680
Thank you, Zhang Ran.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:43.960
No need for thanks.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:44.640
Let's go.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:45.400
The soup?

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:46.960
Soup's divine, yeah?

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.400
I'll have my mom work the magic again.

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:49.800
Thank your mom for me.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:50.640
Don't mention it.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:51.920
We're off now.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:52.720
Take care.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:53.840
Can you at least

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:54.520
crack a smile?

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.520
End of visiting hours.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.000
Don't disturb their rest.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.120
What's that look?

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.800
You're making me feel like a felon.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.280
It's getting in my eyes.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.560
As if. This is anti-splash!

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.120
For real.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.640
It has a splash guard.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.160
Let me know early what kind of soup

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.400
you're bringing to the

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.400
hospital tomorrow,

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.040
so I can get the groceries early.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:18.720
Don't bother.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.840
His dad's being discharged tomorrow.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.640
About to be discharged?

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.880
All this time,

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.280
we haven't even visited once.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.440
How thoughtless!

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.880
Come on, arrange for us to meet.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.440
Arrange? I've already tried.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.640
I've talked myself hoarse.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:35.480
But if I ever said

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.040
a word about his dad, he flips.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.400
Like a lit firecracker.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.360
What am I to do?

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.480
You're now

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.000
his daughter-in-law.

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:48.920
Just remember,

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.240
no matter what,

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.480
harmony leads to prosperity.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.880
You've got to help

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.080
mend their relationship.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:57.920
They may act stubborn,

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.320
but they'll appreciate it deep down.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:00.600
Of course I get it.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:01.720
Your daughter's not an idiot.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.960
Get what? You little fool.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.040
I can't stop being worried

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.200
about this moving-out thing.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.160
After all these years?

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.800
I just came back from abroad, remember?

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.240
I can tell

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.440
a good guy from a kidnapper.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.960
Who would buy you, huh?

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.720
You'd better

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:21.880
talk me up a bit.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.400
After all, it reflects on you too.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.680
Is my dad stuck in there?

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:28.880
Dad, can you hurry up?

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.440
I'm dying to take a shower.

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.720
If you don't knock,

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:34.680
he won't hear you.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:37.120
I saw him yesterday

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.520
watching girls dance, Mom.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.320
Keep an eye on him.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.040
Good.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.520
So we can kick him out, is that it?

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.360
Is yours too hot?

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.960
Mine's not at all.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.640
Add some boiling water for me.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.160
Move it.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.320
Let me test it.

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.960
Are you trying to scald me to death?

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.200
Just mix it with your foot!

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.640
Ran's moving out.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.440
Is that why you're taking it out on me?

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.880
You should talk to her.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:27.920
What's the point?

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.280
Our daughter is married.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.200
She has her own family now.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.560
For the second half of her life,

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.720
the most important person is Yudong.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.960
We are only her family of origin.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.680
You have to accept that.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.040
Her moving out

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.000
is her returning to her own family.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.040
What about us?

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.160
We stay in ours, just the two of us.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.880
Isn't that nice?

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.440
Young couple, old companions.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.080
Zhang Ran has Yudong.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.080
Don't you have me by your side?

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.480
Since when did you become so eloquent?

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.000
I thought you were reading from something.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:06.280
Is that an option?

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.920
Family of origin or not,

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.240
I'm still her mother.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.760
She's flesh of my flesh.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.040
Even if she gave me the cold shoulder,

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:18.880
I'd be happy she stayed.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.000
Yes, you're right.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.920
You're the closest person to her.

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.480
You'll always be her mother.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.160
That will never change.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.920
Alright, soak your own feet then.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:47.720
How am I supposed

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.720
to use it later?

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:49.640
Here.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.320
This outfit feels really weird.

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.360
The pants are super tight.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.760
Alright, looks good on you.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:13.640
Fits well.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.720
I don't even know how to play soccer.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.600
Will I be okay?

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.560
No problem.

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:18.720
Just goof around.

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:27.320
Why are our jerseys

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.360
different?

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.440
I deliberately placed you on

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:31.480
the opposing team.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.560
Your main mission today

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.400
is to disrupt their rhythm.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.320
They don't know you can't play.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.520
We'll coordinate from inside and out.

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:41.280
Got it?

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.720
You want me to be a spy?

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.920
More accurately, an undercover agent.

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:49.880
Watch for my signal then.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.040
Play it by ear.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.160
Sorry.

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.040
Try to find a way

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.520
to let Xing Kai score more.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.640
Ever since we last met him,

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:04.480
there's been no word.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.320
I thought the deal fell through.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.400
Why soccer?

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.560
No falling through.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:09.920
Today's game

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.240
is precisely to seal the deal.

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.480
Cheng Man used to close deals

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.880
at the HK investment bank

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.640
by playing tennis with the bosses.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:18.720
This is some

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.440
high-level business etiquette.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:22.040
Alright.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.120
Be bold and aggressive!

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.320
Wait,

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.360
what exactly should I do?

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.480
Just follow the ball.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.720
Liu, over here!

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.440
Why are you always following me?

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:54.640
Over here!

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.720
What are you doing? Get away!

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:58.680
Move!

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:01.480
Nice shot!

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.560
Keep pressing, go!

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:09.600
Great goal!

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.880
How's that? Not bad, yeah?

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.120
Dude, I asked you to be an undercover,

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.800
but you're practically becoming

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:19.880
the MVP for the other team.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:20.560
You are not

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.880
supposed to compete with him?

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.480
Didn't you tell me to follow the ball?

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.640
I wanted to let him score!

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:27.160
Oh my gosh.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.880
Then what should I do?

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:30.480
Forget it. I doubt he's

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.600
ever played like this.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.040
Play properly.

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:32.920
He's not an idiot.

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:33.680
Got it.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.040
Be a good teammate.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.280
Here, pass to me!

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:41.760
Over here!

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.280
Mr. Xing!

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.280
Mr. Xing!

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:47.520
Are you okay?

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:48.280
Mr. Xing!

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.200
Are you alright?

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.640
Mr. Xing! Mr. Xing!

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:53.480
Go get an ice pack!

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:54.200
Okay.

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.000
What the hell, man?

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.240
Who's that on the ground?

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.560
Xing Kai. You knocked him over.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.040
Did I?

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.280
Didn't you say

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.280
to be bold and aggressive?

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.360
Yeah, but I didn't

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.040
tell you to

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:11.320
murder the old man!

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:14.560
So what now?

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.480
We're screwed. Total disaster.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.520
Forget about his money.

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.880
We're lucky if he doesn't sue us.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.600
Liu, go call them over.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.040
Okay.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:26.880
Mr. Li.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.200
Mr. Xing wants to see you both.

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.040
I'm fine. Don't crowd around.

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:35.920
It's alright.

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:38.240
Are you okay, Mr. Xing?

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:38.760
I'm fine.

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.040
Everyone, break it up, please.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.040
Go take a break.

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:44.480
Go on.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:45.280
Okay, okay.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:46.000
Let's chat.

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:46.840
Sit, you two.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.040
I'm so sorry.

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.040
It's nothing. Actually, I...

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.280
I... I really didn't mean to.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:52.880
I'm so sorry.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.680
That was just my excuse to rest.

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:55.640
Sit, please.

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.480
He just got back from abroad.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.600
Still jet-lagged.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:31:59.600
So his mind has always

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.200
been a bit off. Really sorry.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:02.040
Truly.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:02.680
It's fine.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.520
Sorry, sorry.

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.640
Dr. Fu, rest assured.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.480
My offer to you both

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:09.720
still stands.

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.240
In fact, I've got to know you

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.640
better from this game.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.240
And I like you even more now.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:20.000
You're genuine, not a flatterer.

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.880
I'm even happier you knocked me down.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.280
In the past,

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.160
when company founders

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.480
played soccer with me,

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.160
they'd feed me passes

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.840
if they were on my team.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.280
Even if they weren't,

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.520
no one dared to tackle,

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:37.960
let alone bump into me.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.880
You are the first to ever knock me down.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:46.280
So, let's hear it.

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:49.800
When are you two planning to start

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.360
working for me?

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:52.640
Anytime.

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.000
Seriously, we're ready.

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.960
Daoqi, I've thought it over.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.520
You have a background in marketing.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.720
I plan to have you

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.600
join the sales department

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:06.920
as a senior manager.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.200
What monthly salary

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.520
are you having in mind?

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:13.360
Anything is fine. Your shots.

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.080
Good, good.

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.520
I like that attitude of yours,

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.000
not haggling over price.

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.720
But I don't want to be a senior manager.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:24.680
I want to become

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:25.920
a partner in this company.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.760
A partner?

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.400
Dr. Fu, what are your thoughts?

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.200
We're more than brothers.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.400
No matter what we do,

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.080
we feel more secure doing it together.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.040
Secure, huh?

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.480
I understand you.

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.080
But that doesn't mean

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.280
others do too.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:00.960
Look, I'll be honest with you.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.560
This time, I'm putting in

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.360
51% for the angel round.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.360
Later there will be Series A, B, C...

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:09.679
There will be more

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:11.360
investment firms coming in.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.760
We'll expand the scale,

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.960
and generate hype.

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:16.920
Daoqi, tell me,

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.239
how do I explain to others

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.560
your position in this company?

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.920
Where does your value lie?

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:25.480
Well, here's the thing. I'm thinking

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:27.199
no other investors needed.

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:29.080
I'll cover the other

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:29.920
forty-nine percent.

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:37.560
Forty-nine?

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.000
Okay?

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:40.800
Are you sure?

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:41.719
I'm sure.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:43.880
And I

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.360
want to be the legal representative.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.159
Is that okay?

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:57.680
Well.

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.200
In a soccer match,

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.840
the primary investor

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.800
gets knocked down

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:06.720
by the company's CEO.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.440
Not only is he unhurt,

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.800
he gains a second investor from it.

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:16.480
Sitting on the field,

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.520
they map out the company's

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:21.000
future business plan.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.480
What a great startup story.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.080
Alright.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:32.920
Pleasure doing business.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:36.640
Pleasure's mine.

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:50.760
Where's the money?

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:51.640
I'm talking to you.

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:52.840
Somewhere. Don't worry.

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.400
How can I not worry?

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.280
I'm your partner.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.200
Of course I care.

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.000
Trust me, it's there.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.000
Just tell me.

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:02.840
Won the lottery.

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.000
Tell me the truth.

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.520
Alright, but don't tell

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.800
Cheng Man or my mom, yeah?

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.480
Just spill it!

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:14.760
I sold my home.

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:17.440
Are you nuts?

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.480
Sold it?

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.520
Not the one we live in.

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.400
The old one I lived in with my mom.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.640
After I got married,

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.080
my mom thought no asset to my name

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:27.960
means nothing

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:29.080
to fall back on.

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.760
She insisted on transferring it to me.

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:32.800
Perfect timing. No one'd know

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:33.680
if I sold it.

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.240
Don't you dare tell anyone.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.840
You shouldn't have sold any of them!

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:38.800
Where are you going?

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.160
That wasn't a big deal before.

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.040
But now you're

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.080
putting pressure on me.

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:42.720
You know?

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.200
Good. You should feel stressed.

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.920
You're the CEO, after all.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.240
No pressure, no drive.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.840
Work hard, partner.

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.840
Turn that pressure into motivation.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.320
When we make it big,

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.400
we'll each get a mansion.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:55.920
Also,

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.440
why did you insist on

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.240
being the legal rep?

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:02.160
Because on the business license,

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.800
the only name you'll see

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.080
is the legal rep's.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:06.080
Understand?

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:09.240
Let's go.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:11.840
Where to?

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.160
Isn't your dad getting discharged tonight?

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:16.400
Let's go see him.

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:19.560
Take your tie.

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:21.920
I've got stuff to do. I'll bail.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.360
Why bailing?

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.120
I have things to do. Understood?

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:26.000
Hey.

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:27.480
Man.

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.200
Which one of us is the real son here?

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.840
Anyone can pick him up. You go.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.480
Unbelievable.

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:45.240
Yudong.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.720
The day after Xiaoyan and I got married,

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:51.200
you left for Canada.

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:55.440
Twenty years have passed in a blink.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.040
How many

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.600
twenty-year spans do we get in life?

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:03.760
It's seventeen.

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:09.560
Bo?

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.520
Hurry! She's about to go off air.

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:12.360
Tried my best.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:12.960
Everything okay?

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.120
This one worked out okay.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:14.600
Good.

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:15.440
She's not off yet, right?

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:16.280
No, not yet.

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.400
Should be any second.

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.120
Let me check.

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.080
She's off, off, off.

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:20.920
Quick, quick!

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:21.880
Perfect timing.

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:24.680
Anran.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.480
Anran, I got you all some coffee.

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:29.280
Thank you.

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.200
No problem.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:32.560
No sneakers today?

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.240
I bought these high heels

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.320
from your live stream.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:36.280
I don't usually shop

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.000
in live streams.

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.240
I think you have great taste,

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.440
so I bought a pair there.

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:40.280
My pillows

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.640
were also from your stream.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:43.200
Me, my husband, my parents,

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.280
we all use those pillows.

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:45.520
Even this neck pillow

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.200
is from there.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.000
Yeah, cheap, comfy, and warm.

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.040
Really?

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:49.640
Yep.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.320
And you look adorable wearing it.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.120
Thanks.

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.840
You don't have to waste money.

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:54.880
If you need,

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.000
just tell me.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.440
I'll send it to you.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:57.880
Okay?

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.280
It's not wasteful spending.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:00.960
We genuinely

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.480
want to support you.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.240
We'll leave you to it.

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:06.080
Zhang Ran.

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.360
You're a real laugh

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:12.520
and interesting.

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.760
I'll just leave my live stream

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:15.640
in your capable hands.

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.800
I feel at ease with you here.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:19.480
Keep it up.

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:20.640
Will do. Thanks.

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:21.560
Thank you.

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:33.080
A beautiful new day begins!

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.480
Are Yudong and Ran

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.320
occupied today?

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.880
Yes, Zhang Ran is live streaming.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.080
She can't make it today.

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.800
Yudong was about to come together,

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.040
but then an investor

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:49.560
called him last minute,

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.040
so he went to meet him.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.120
Why didn't he take you along?

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.000
I'm here to pick you up.

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.200
Besides, both of us

00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:59.480
showing up feels like

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.800
an overkill for a small investor.

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:02.760
Yudong has business to do.

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:07.200
Actually, he's here.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.480
Looks like the meeting wrapped up fast.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.080
Hey you, move. Help him into the car.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.560
Let's go, Mr. Fu.

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.000
Take it easy.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:23.360
Here, come on.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:24.440
This way.

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:25.080
Yudong.

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.480
Didn't delay things?

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:31.840
Not at all.

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.520
I don't want to be your burden.

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:38.920
You're not.

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:39.760
You won't be.

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:41.800
Let's go.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:44.080
Little liar.

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.640
Probably that investor

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.280
wasn't that reliable anyway.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:49.440
Probably.

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:50.920
Isn't it wonderful

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:51.680
that he came?

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:52.040
Exactly.

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:52.840
See? Everything's fine.

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.080
Fu Yudong, stop.

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.800
What's all the stomping ahead about?

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.160
Do you have an idea

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.600
I haven't eaten all day?

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:15.160
Those heels have

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.760
rubbed my feet raw.

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:17.400
Since when

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:18.560
did you start to

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:19.960
wear high heels?

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:21.640
Normally I don't.

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.080
These were a token of sincerity.

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:24.560
I offended Lin Anran, so I specially

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.000
bought them from her live stream.

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:27.000
I don't get you.

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.400
Something on your mind, dear?

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:40.400
Not really.

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:43.280
Oh, right.

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.480
You met the investor today.

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:45.280
How did it go?

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:47.360
Reached an agreement.

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:48.600
But deep down,

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:49.640
I'm still uneasy.

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.040
What's there to be uneasy about?

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:51.920
It's good news.

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.160
What's bothering you?

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.440
You're all frowny.

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.280
You've got to

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.600
un-furrow that brow.

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:57.760
I'm worried about Li Daoqi.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:58.560
He sold his apartment

00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.280
for this venture.

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:01.800
Doesn't that mean

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.240
he's seriously going all in?

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:04.680
All businesses do have risks.

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:05.520
But it's not wise

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:06.480
being restless.

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.200
Well, you can't

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.640
be freaking out all the time.

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:09.400
Hold on tight, will you?

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:09.960
You hold on.

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:10.520
You're bouncing me around.

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:12.520
Don't you dare drop me.

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:15.480
Honey, I think we

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:17.640
are both due for a rebound.

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:18.720
How?

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:20.160
Look.

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:21.520
Today, Lin Anran,

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:22.560
that massive iceberg,

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:23.560
was melted by me.

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:24.400
What else could

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.120
hold us back?

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:25.920
Optimist.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.400
Of course. No big deal.

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:28.520
Can you slow down?

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:29.440
My heels hurt.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:29.840
Can't.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.680
Then can you go faster?

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:32.280
Feel like

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:33.080
we're crawling.

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.400
That's the fastest I can go.

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:35.640
Fu Yudong, do you know

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:36.840
what your flaw is?

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:37.640
What?

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.800
You're a lump of an iceberg.

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:42.840
Lump?

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:44.640
Nice wording.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.400
If I'm an iceberg, what are you?

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.040
I'm the dollar-store icebreaker.

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:20.120
All set.

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:23.480
Yudong.

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:25.320
Come visit when you have time.

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:26.040
Okay.

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:26.720
It's not like

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.120
they're moving far away.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.480
Just across town.

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:31.880
Don't always order takeout.

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:33.440
If you crave something, just call

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:34.800
or send a message.

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:35.840
Alright. Don't worry.

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:36.560
We're off then.

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:37.680
Hello, anybody here?

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:38.760
Talk to me too, yeah?

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:40.160
I'm coming over right now.

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:41.760
You have the key.

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:43.320
You can help yourself 24/7.

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:44.400
Do we need to remind you?

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:45.440
I'm still your daughter, okay?

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.320
Treat me better.

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:47.400
Bye, goodbye.

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:48.960
Let's go.

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:51.400
Bye, Dad, Mom.

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:52.080
Alright.

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:52.960
Go back inside.

00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:54.160
Are you crying?

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:55.440
Oh, stop it.

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:56.080
Why would I cry?

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.600
I'll come visit you often.

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.280
I'll miss you too.

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:01.400
See you, little chatterbox.

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:03.960
Look how thrilled she is.
