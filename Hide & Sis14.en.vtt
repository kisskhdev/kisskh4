WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.568
You found everything in this flash drive by yourself?

00:00:03.712 --> 00:00:05.208
No, someone helped me.

00:00:05.232 --> 00:00:07.720
The person who started the fire

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.712
at the nightclub that night is Sarah?

00:00:09.736 --> 00:00:13.584
Dad and Uncle Kajorn killed Parn’s mom?

00:00:13.608 --> 00:00:15.632
Then Parn could have…

00:00:15.656 --> 00:00:17.592
Why do you look so surprised?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.336
Sister?

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.240
If the skeleton in the well was really Aunt Fai,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.040
then…

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.496
I think Parn could be

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.376
Someone who’s trying to take revenge on us.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.360
How would Parn do that?

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.024
She can’t even walk.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.968
Because she was pretending.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.184
I think we should hand this over to the police.

00:00:49.208 --> 00:00:50.736
Then we’ll really get to know

00:00:51.352 --> 00:00:53.350
if Parn really can’t walk.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.408
Hello.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.296
Hello.

00:01:15.336 --> 00:01:16.696
Sorry to bother you.

00:01:16.728 --> 00:01:17.976
It’s okay.

00:01:18.008 --> 00:01:19.664
We were about to head to the police station.

00:01:19.688 --> 00:01:21.224
I’m from Thonglor Police Station.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.744
Thonglor Police Station?

00:01:22.768 --> 00:01:23.768
Yes.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.792
May I invite Miss Chompoonuch Bupphachinda

00:01:28.816 --> 00:01:31.192
to testify on the Murder of the Witness

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:32.576
in the Black Fairy Nightclub case.

00:02:53.184 --> 00:02:54.272
Damn it.

00:02:54.304 --> 00:02:56.120
Why are the police at my house so often?

00:02:56.152 --> 00:02:58.120
I think I’m starting to get used to it.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.520
Where are you guys going?

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.976
The police took Chompoo in

00:03:06.016 --> 00:03:08.200
so Bua and I are going to catch up with her.

00:03:10.224 --> 00:03:12.096
What brings you here?

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.352
We’ve examined the CCTVs

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.240
around the Black Fairy Nightclub.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.240
Many of them captured Thana committing the crime.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.328
He destroyed the nightclub's server room and escaped.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.792
We speculate that everything Thana did

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:38.992
was to destroy the evidence from the CCTV

00:03:39.008 --> 00:03:40.736
on the night of the fire.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.744
I still don’t understand

00:03:42.768 --> 00:03:44.232
what that has to do with me.

00:03:44.256 --> 00:03:47.472
Thana had no relation with anyone at the scene

00:03:47.504 --> 00:03:48.560
accept you.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.768
We’re just neighbors.

00:03:53.072 --> 00:03:55.704
No, he was my sister’s friend.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.568
A neighbor who was with you

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.984
on the night your sister disappeared?

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.216
We have the testimony record

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.192
which shows that you guys are too close

00:04:05.208 --> 00:04:06.568
to be just acquaintances.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.424
That’s not it.

00:04:09.456 --> 00:04:11.680
You have to update your information, Officer.

00:04:11.712 --> 00:04:13.264
I’ve already given a new testimony

00:04:13.296 --> 00:04:16.672
that I was with Nathat, not Thana.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.664
But the fact that he testified for you
in the first place,

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.144
I think that’s not just a normal relationship.

00:04:24.168 --> 00:04:27.440
Thana was trying to destroy the evidence from the CCTV

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.760
when he wasn’t involved in the incident

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.752
and even killed the witness who survived.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.592
Rest in peace.

00:04:42.752 --> 00:04:46.280
Why do you think he did that, Miss Chompoo?

00:04:49.336 --> 00:04:51.592
So what was actually going on?

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.816
Based on the initial investigation,

00:04:54.856 --> 00:04:59.912
after you two left to take Picha to the hospital,

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.368
Thana came back here again.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:08.976
He came back here?

00:05:09.968 --> 00:05:11.288
Why?

00:05:13.016 --> 00:05:15.016
We’re not sure about that either.

00:05:15.056 --> 00:05:16.584
But at the scene,

00:05:16.608 --> 00:05:18.400
we found footsteps left by soil dirt

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.400
which probably came from Thana.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.768
We also found his DNA.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.860
Because…

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.728
Because Thana killed Aunty Chom, right?

00:05:30.768 --> 00:05:32.352
Thana was not the attacker.

00:05:32.392 --> 00:05:34.350
He might have been attacked.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.952
Aunty Chom!

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.744
What’s going on?

00:05:37.776 --> 00:05:38.832
Where’s Chompoo?

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.544
Thana, please untie me.

00:05:42.584 --> 00:05:46.360
I was hurt and tied up like this.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.808
Please help me.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.168
What about Chompoo?

00:05:49.208 --> 00:05:49.880
Where is she?

00:05:49.904 --> 00:05:51.040
Miss Chom…

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.728
I can’t take this anymore.

00:05:55.752 --> 00:05:56.752
Aunty Chom!

00:05:56.952 --> 00:05:58.072
Aunty! Aunty!

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:08.616
Aunty Chom!

00:06:30.944 --> 00:06:31.680
Shit.

00:06:31.704 --> 00:06:32.704
Argh!

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.776
We can’t continue the investigation

00:06:36.808 --> 00:06:38.576
without your cooperation.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:41.290
The thing is…

00:06:44.976 --> 00:06:46.980
It was my fault.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.584
Thana said that he was with me that night

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.000
because I begged him to.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.096
Because I wanted to protect Nathat.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.336
But for the things he did after that,

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.872
I never asked

00:07:14.896 --> 00:07:16.504
or told him to.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.976
But he did them

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.368
because he wanted to protect me.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.328
What should we do with him?

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.504
We found traces of fights and struggles

00:08:12.528 --> 00:08:15.304
so we speculated that it wasn’t a suicide.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.048
We also found Thana’s blood DNA on the floor.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.704
It’s possible that

00:08:21.728 --> 00:08:24.512
Thana was attacked before he escaped.

00:09:13.992 --> 00:09:15.200
Urgh!

00:09:47.904 --> 00:09:49.900
As for Parn’s testimony,

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.960
she said she didn’t know anything.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.248
She only realized what had happened

00:09:53.272 --> 00:09:55.176
when the police knocked on her door.

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:59.960
But the police had restricted the crime scene

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:03.600
so there was no way the blood
could get stained on the wheelchair.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.968
And where is Parn right now?

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.416
She had escaped.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:29.630
Hey.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:30.670
How is it going?

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.904
I have the team spread out to search.

00:10:32.928 --> 00:10:34.264
She can’t have gone very far.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.226
But the police in this area
aren’t so used to navigating the woods.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:38.816
I was thinking of calling for support.

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:41.160
Then I’ll help with the search.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.160
You take Picha and Bua to the station.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.360
Okay.

00:10:59.376 --> 00:11:00.376
Hey.

00:11:06.384 --> 00:11:07.616
If she didn’t escape from the front,

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.080
then she must have escaped this way.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:13.472
I think I can guess which way Parn escaped.

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:19.160
Did she really manage to escape?

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:34.580
Bua!

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:35.856
Bua!

00:11:35.888 --> 00:11:36.648
Bua.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:37.984
Hang in there, Bua.

00:11:41.448 --> 00:11:43.450
I’m sorry about Aunt Fai.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.576
I’m sorry I was the cause.

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.168
I’m sorry on Dad’s behalf.

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:51.152
I’m sorry on Uncle Kajorn’s behalf.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.780
I’m sorry on their behalf for everything.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.896
If I could turn back time,

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.224
I would never let it happen.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:59.752
There’s no use apologizing.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.480
It’s far beyond what apologizing can do.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:05.420
Parn.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.016
Tell me whatever you want.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.952
But I’m begging you,

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.728
please don’t harm us.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.416
Please don’t do anything to Bua.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.464
As expected of sisters.

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:26.720
Chatfah said exactly the same thing.

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.704
Or is it because when you’re scared to die,

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.184
you would have the guts to lie?

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:39.872
Since when could you walk?

00:12:40.984 --> 00:12:42.512
I could walk a long time ago.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.328
Worked so hard on my physical therapy.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.192
So painful I could die.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.560
But finally, I could walk.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.608
Then why didn’t you tell anyone?

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.280
Pretending to be weak

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.400
allowed me to live more at ease in this family.

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:04.712
You’re angry at me for the legacy, right?

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.840
It’s not like what you think.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.688
Dad gave me everything

00:13:09.728 --> 00:13:11.192
because he had his reason.

00:13:11.232 --> 00:13:12.352
Which is

00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:16.208
to pass on an evil legacy

00:13:16.872 --> 00:13:18.870
to the child he hated the most.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:20.368
Is that it?

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.688
I know.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.592
You’re not Uncle Asok’s daughter.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.160
Dad told me that

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.312
Uncle Asok had been suspicious of it for a while

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.016
so he secretly had a DNA test.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:41.968
But the problem was

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.800
he didn’t know whose daughter you were.

00:13:51.872 --> 00:13:53.224
Don’t tell me,

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.392
that the one who told Dad about it…

00:14:00.536 --> 00:14:02.808
I was searching for a long time.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.480
I thought it was my sisters

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.112
who ran their mouths to Dad

00:14:06.136 --> 00:14:07.712
and made my Mom commit suicide.

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:11.660
You…

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:15.120
You thought those three said it?

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.616
I will tell you what

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:25.168
your three sisters are dumb as hell.

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.472
As for you,

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.576
I thought you were more clever.

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:35.952
Little did I know,

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:37.616
you’re just as dumb.

00:14:37.648 --> 00:14:38.896
What do you mean?

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:43.408
You were looking for the one

00:14:43.432 --> 00:14:46.072
who told Uncle Asok the truth?

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.160
The one who made Uncle Asok realize
that Aunt Pimol had an affair

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.328
was you.

00:14:56.624 --> 00:14:58.620
What does the DNA test result say?

00:15:06.376 --> 00:15:08.190
Sneakier than we thought.

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:11.496
What are you going to do next?

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:19.064
That man entered the house again.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.280
Pimol was trying to hide it from me.

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:25.808
I overheard Pimol talking to her friend on the phone

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.360
about the wealth.

00:15:27.696 --> 00:15:30.824
She’s probably hoping Chat would get them all.

00:15:30.856 --> 00:15:33.592
Pimol is really only waiting for that.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:35.210
Chat!

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:37.752
Where are you going?

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.776
Are you going to see Arch?

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:42.504
Yes.

00:15:42.528 --> 00:15:43.944
I told you already.

00:15:44.184 --> 00:15:45.480
But these days,

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.832
Dad has been keeping a close eye on us.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.424
I don’t want you to make any moves.

00:15:50.448 --> 00:15:52.736
I don’t even go out to see Chad.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.720
Arch only comes to Thailand every once in a while

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.352
so I have to go and see him.

00:15:57.384 --> 00:15:59.208
I won’t let Dad know about this.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.208
I miss you so much!

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.032
It was because of me?

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.976
Mom had to die like that because of me?

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.432
If I didn’t insist on going to see Arch that day,

00:16:49.488 --> 00:16:51.490
Dad wouldn’t have known.

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:04.208
Why did you want to find out
who revealed the truth?

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:08.728
When the evidence of your Mom having a secret lover

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:11.432
is yourself.

00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:17.648
Why are you angry?

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.016
I’m telling the truth.

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:26.848
You are aware, right?

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.960
That you shouldn’t even be here.

00:17:31.496 --> 00:17:33.500
It doesn’t even belong to you.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.072
Yet you still stick around,
flaunting yourself as his daughter.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:42.728
This is my family!

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:45.952
Are you trying to hypnotize yourself?

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.024
Do the others believe that like you do?

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:52.760
They all hate you.

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:56.560
I pity you all along.

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:00.320
You needed love so much

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:03.440
but don’t know the way to earn it.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.528
Everything you did

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:10.456
only pushed people away from you.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.032
Did you hate me all along?

00:18:15.944 --> 00:18:18.328
How can I love someone
who lit the fire and burned me?

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.128
Parn!

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.720
Don’t be afraid, Chat.

00:18:27.752 --> 00:18:29.976
You’re not the only one who has to face it.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.144
Your sisters will, too.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.256
Everyone has been happy for too long.

00:18:34.304 --> 00:18:34.930
Parn!

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.264
Tell me whatever you want, Parn.

00:18:37.296 --> 00:18:38.392
If you want money,

00:18:38.424 --> 00:18:39.352
the house,

00:18:39.384 --> 00:18:40.752
if you want everything,

00:18:40.784 --> 00:18:41.808
I will give you all.

00:18:41.848 --> 00:18:42.736
I’m begging you,

00:18:42.784 --> 00:18:44.740
please don’t harm my sisters.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.600
That was unexpected.

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:54.280
I thought all along

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:57.368
that you would ask me to spare your life.

00:18:58.620 --> 00:18:59.584
Are you asking me

00:18:59.608 --> 00:19:01.580
to spare the others’ lives?

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:04.192
That means

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.840
you really do love your sisters.

00:19:17.336 --> 00:19:18.448
That’s nice.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:21.880
That you really love someone.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.744
At least,

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:27.576
you’re capable of feeling pain.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.240
Parn.

00:19:32.016 --> 00:19:33.232
You know what?

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.328
Bua is trying to find out

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.064
who aren’t Uncle Asok’s daughters.

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:43.904
Even without knowing
that you’re not her real sister,

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.944
she doesn’t even think of you as her family.

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:50.776
What if she knows?

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.560
Where’s your place then?

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:58.176
This is not even your house.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:02.288
Neither does the last name.

00:20:05.496 --> 00:20:07.500
You don’t have anything left, Chat.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:11.590
Parn.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.784
Being abandoned by the one you love

00:20:16.008 --> 00:20:17.768
is the most painful thing.

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.000
Parn.

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:22.960
Please don’t do this, Parn.

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:25.160
Please don’t kill me, Parn.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:27.552
Argh!

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:30.010
Kill?

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:33.416
That’s too basic.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.784
What I’m about to do to your family

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:39.352
is way more painful.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.720
I will help you.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:01.896
Let’s f*ck up the people in this family.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.704
Make them know what it feels like

00:21:21.744 --> 00:21:25.736
to live without being able to trust anyone.

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:32.760
Parn, sweetie.

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:37.840
Parn.

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.320
Dad.

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:43.750
Parn.

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.976
You must be wondering

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.400
why I’m doing this to you.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.456
Mom, too, was wondering

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:12.328
why you did that to her, Dad.

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:25.328
Hello.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.576
Hello.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:32.352
I’d like to order a flower basket for my sister.

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:34.568
I’m going to talk to Chat.

00:22:34.608 --> 00:22:35.688
Come on, let’s go home.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:36.344
- That’s enough.
- Urgh!

00:22:36.368 --> 00:22:37.552
You’re wasted, Chom.

00:22:37.576 --> 00:22:39.416
I’m not even drunk.

00:22:40.616 --> 00:22:42.620
Urgh! I’m going to talk to Chat!

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.400
Your entire family is selfish!

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:49.008
When you decided to burn the place,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.768
did you think about the others?

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.672
When your dad killed my mother,

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.968
did he ever think of how I would live?

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.840
No one thought of that

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.984
because everyone only thinks of themselves.

00:23:06.424 --> 00:23:07.424
Yes.

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:10.136
We’re selfish.

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:15.232
We’d do anything to survive.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.368
Even if I realize my wrongs now,

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:24.224
I know it’s not enough.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:29.400
I will not take anything that belongs to
Bupphachinda anymore.

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:33.200
I will also make up for what I did to everyone.

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:35.064
Liar.

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:38.392
Even up to now,

00:23:39.923 --> 00:23:42.053
you still have something hidden away from everyone.

00:23:45.247 --> 00:23:47.249
A pretentious person like you

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.496
will never do as you say.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.784
At this point,

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:13.648
I think death is too simple for you guys.

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:17.512
Living while bearing the weight of loss

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:20.384
is the true torture.

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:41.780
Parn.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.560
Parn.

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:48.970
Bua.

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:50.030
Bua.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.712
Bua!

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:53.368
Bua!

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.656
Bua!

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:36.016
Please don’t go.

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.568
We’d never work out.

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:45.032
But you’ll always be my maybe.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.848
(The police searched a secret underground
chamber at Bupphachinda’s Orchid Farm.)

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.632
(Over 10 types of chemicals were found.)

00:26:34.664 --> 00:26:37.872
(All can be used as starters of
a large amount of narcotics.)

00:26:37.904 --> 00:26:39.296
(Along with drug-manufacturing machines)

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.736
(and many other unknown chemicals)

00:26:41.776 --> 00:26:46.008
(that can be clearly identified
as starters of drug production.)

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.080
I, Buntharika Bupphachinda,

00:26:49.112 --> 00:26:51.136
the acting CEO of the company,

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:55.584
am speaking as the current
leader of the family.

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:59.112
I will take care of the company and the family

00:26:59.128 --> 00:27:01.110
with the best of my ability.

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:05.336
I will also cooperate with the Officers

00:27:05.376 --> 00:27:08.800
to ensure that the case strictly aligns
with the judicial process.

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.760
I ask for a chance from the public

00:27:13.176 --> 00:27:15.180
to spare us justice.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.120
I heard your family is facing a big lawsuit.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:21.960
Yes.

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:23.640
I see.

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:27.584
It’s too late for me to refute the rumors for you.

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:32.136
And if I deny the relationship between you two,

00:27:32.168 --> 00:27:34.760
the public would think of Nathat in a worse light.

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:38.016
Hmm.

00:27:39.904 --> 00:27:41.360
I think

00:27:41.936 --> 00:27:43.940
I would use this chance

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.704
to win back Nathat’s popularity.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.936
Once your lawsuit is over,

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:56.176
people would see that Nathat is a good boyfriend.

00:27:56.224 --> 00:27:58.216
He didn’t leave his girlfriend’s side.

00:27:58.248 --> 00:28:00.872
It’d be a good image for Nathat too!

00:28:00.912 --> 00:28:02.376
That’s right!

00:28:02.408 --> 00:28:05.744
I’ll have the reporters at our channel
report on this instead.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:09.040
People these days are into love stories after all.

00:28:09.064 --> 00:28:13.328
Who knows, we might win Nathat’s popularity back.

00:28:13.368 --> 00:28:15.576
It’s turning crisis into opportunity!

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.080
I don’t think I can go out with Nathat any longer.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.480
It’s not that I don’t love you

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:32.976
But I really can’t keep on dating you.

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:38.984
I can’t sacrifice myself for this love anymore.

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:41.460
Chom.

00:28:41.768 --> 00:28:43.616
But everything’s over now.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.020
You don’t have to do anything for me anymore.

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:49.904
Whether it’s for me, for you, or anyone,

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.144
I can’t do it anymore.

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:53.984
I’m sorry.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:58.980
Goodbye.

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:04.000
Wa…wait.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:05.960
Hey.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Hold on.

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:08.408
What did you say?

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.352
You turned down my grandson?

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.984
Picha, are you okay?

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.968
It’s the court’s order.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.920
Can I not be okay?

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:36.688
I feel like

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.432
you’ve changed from the first time we met.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.176
You seem more decisive.

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:50.968
I don’t want to live a life
holding on to anything anymore.

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.472
I will go all in with my work.

00:29:54.512 --> 00:29:56.384
Accept what I did wrong.

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.184
I have so many things in life to think about.

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:02.584
Does that include things about me?

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:13.312
Good luck.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.728
At the same bar when you’re off duty.

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:25.656
That’s when I’ll give you the answer.

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:40.968
Captain.

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.312
I didn’t have the chance to thank you.

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:47.984
Thank you for everything all this time.

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:53.352
I should be the one to thank you guys.

00:30:55.152 --> 00:30:57.150
Thank you for making me realize

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:59.952
that the justice system I used to have faith in

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:01.744
is not that almighty.

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:05.312
Because if it were,

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:07.968
no one would have died hopelessly.

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.488
If you’re talking about Parn, then I’m sorry.

00:31:19.208 --> 00:31:21.472
For being part of what made Parn turn out like this.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:29.768
Keep on feeling guilty

00:31:30.752 --> 00:31:32.750
because this won’t end the way you think.

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:35.960
It will keep coming back around

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:39.584
at least in your mind.

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:19.152
Based on the most recent testimony,

00:32:19.184 --> 00:32:21.352
during the time you were gone,

00:32:21.384 --> 00:32:24.808
you mentioned Chatfah’s half-brother, too, right?

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:28.032
I’d advise that, no matter what,

00:32:28.064 --> 00:32:31.072
you should have him testify for you in court.

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:34.768
He has a criminal record in America.

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:37.700
He might even be under a court warrant at this point.

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:41.232
But may I advise that,

00:32:41.272 --> 00:32:43.592
without this personal witness,

00:32:43.616 --> 00:32:47.264
it might be harder for us to fight the case in court.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.616
No matter what,

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.760
I’ll probably never get to see him again.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:17.776
Bupphachat Mansion.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:20.864
Will we get to meet again?

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:24.600
What’s ours

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:27.568
will come back to us eventually.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:33.496
Or maybe it was never ours from the start.

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:50.420
What are you looking at?

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:54.536
Nothing.

00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:58.192
Or are you waiting for someone?

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.180
I’m not waiting for anyone anymore.

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.776
Why did you pull the car over?

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:42.704
The reason I called you in today

00:34:42.736 --> 00:34:44.700
wasn’t just to bid farewell to the mansion.

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:47.960
I have something to tell you.

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:54.928
What are you reading, Mom?

00:34:55.450 --> 00:34:58.232
Some documents about Picha’s disease.

00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.568
No matter how I read it, I still don't get it.

00:34:59.592 --> 00:35:01.150
My head hurts.

00:35:07.032 --> 00:35:09.030
What’s wrong with Picha?

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:10.380
Epilepsy.

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:12.584
If she has lots of seizures,

00:35:12.608 --> 00:35:14.392
her personality will change,

00:35:14.408 --> 00:35:16.568
forget some of her memories,

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.768
and confuse between dreams and reality.

00:35:27.632 --> 00:35:29.960
You were really born to cause trouble.

00:35:33.984 --> 00:35:36.140
PUDPICHAYA BUPPHACHINDA

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:40.784
Don’t our family all have blood type A?

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:43.392
Why does Picha have blood type B?

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:49.144
They probably wrote it wrong.

00:35:49.168 --> 00:35:50.352
Look after your sister.

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:52.744
What did you say?

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.168
Chat wasn’t the only one

00:35:55.208 --> 00:35:56.624
who was not Dad’s daughter.

00:35:58.060 --> 00:35:59.264
But Picha too.

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:04.784
Do you mean

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:07.680
Picha isn’t either?

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:13.168
I have always been curious about Picha’s blood type

00:36:13.216 --> 00:36:16.080
so I had her DNA tested to compare with Dad’s.

00:36:19.433 --> 00:36:20.826
ASOKSAPUN BUPPHACHINDA AND PUDPICHAYA BUPPHACHINDA
* NO RELATION AS FATHER AND CHILD

00:36:20.851 --> 00:36:21.746
- But there’s one more thing that still bothers me.

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:27.464
The police said Chat was stabbed

00:36:27.488 --> 00:36:28.960
and escaped into the woods

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:31.576
before she fell near the rocks.

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:35.968
It seemed like an accident.

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:39.160
So what are you suspecting?

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.856
When we went to look for Chat in the woods,

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.672
Pi was gone for a big while.

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:48.180
Wasn’t she?

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:53.288
What are you trying to tell me?

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:55.840
Parn was the one who stabbed Chat, indeed.

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.120
But the one who killed Chat

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.208
was probably not Parn.

00:37:04.872 --> 00:37:05.480
Chat!

00:37:05.512 --> 00:37:06.696
Where are you, Chat?

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:08.050
Chat!

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:09.288
Pi!

00:37:09.312 --> 00:37:10.632
I’m here!

00:37:10.664 --> 00:37:11.552
Chat!

00:37:11.576 --> 00:37:13.464
Why are you here?

00:37:13.488 --> 00:37:15.792
Everyone is searching for you everywhere.

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:19.304
Pi, we can’t be here anymore.

00:37:19.336 --> 00:37:20.952
We can’t be here anymore.

00:37:20.976 --> 00:37:22.376
They found out about us.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.288
We have to run, Pi.

00:37:23.312 --> 00:37:24.968
Otherwise, they’ll kill us.

00:37:25.008 --> 00:37:26.200
What did they find out?

00:37:26.232 --> 00:37:29.240
They found out that you and I are not Dad’s daughters.

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:32.024
Pi!

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.760
You knew, right?

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.664
You also knew, right?

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.752
Pi, Pi.

00:37:42.776 --> 00:37:44.080
Don’t worry.

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:48.424
I promise I won’t tell anyone.

00:37:48.456 --> 00:37:50.864
But we have to run away right now.

00:37:50.896 --> 00:37:53.064
Otherwise, we’re dead.

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:55.816
Who else knows about this?

00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:58.450
No one.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:37:59.976
No one.

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.432
You intentionally shoved your sister, didn’t you?

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:21.280
Why didn’t you take care of your sister?!

00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:27.584
It was because of you

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:30.368
that I’m stuck here.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.880
This house will be yours, Picha.

00:38:35.904 --> 00:38:42.736
The Bupphachat Mansion is to be given
entirely to Miss Chatfah Bupphachinda.

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:47.664
Wait for me!

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:49.100
Ouch!

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:50.300
Picha!

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:51.600
Did you get hurt anywhere?

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:56.352
I think my brake fluid leakage

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:57.840
YOU ARE NEXT.
- But if I could choose,

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:06.488
the only thing I would wish for

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:09.568
is for our family to be the same.

00:39:25.232 --> 00:39:26.232
Pi…

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:27.560
Pi.

00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:38.380
Pi.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:43.660
Pi.

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:19.568
Mom!

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:21.080
Mom, Mom.

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:24.792
Please stop drinking, Mom.

00:40:24.816 --> 00:40:25.816
I’m begging you.

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:29.368
If I died,

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:35.488
please take care of your sister.

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.352
Don’t let anyone hurt you, Pi.

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:43.280
Everything

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.312
must be you guys’.

00:40:52.472 --> 00:40:54.560
No matter what anyone says,

00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:57.416
don’t ever listen to them.

00:40:57.810 --> 00:40:58.810
Mom.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.072
What are you talking about, Mom?

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:04.088
I don’t get it.

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:11.104
Your Dad killed your father.

00:41:13.888 --> 00:41:15.890
If I were to die too,

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.624
what you will have left is…

00:41:20.664 --> 00:41:22.660
only you and your sister.

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:28.016
You have to take good care of your sister, Pi.

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:39.424
(Chatfah, )

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:41.600
(my sister, )

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:43.190
(is dead.)

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:46.400
(And one of us)

00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:49.184
(is the murderer.)

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:55.016
(What’s opposite of love is not hatred.)

00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:57.552
(The more you love, )

00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:59.224
Did you hear something?

00:41:59.256 --> 00:42:00.688
Yeah, what was that sound?

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.608
(when you have a fall-out, )

00:42:02.632 --> 00:42:04.504
(you will hate that person just as much.)

00:42:04.528 --> 00:42:05.528
Pi!

00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:07.168
Did you hear any sound?

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.024
No.

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:10.416
What sound?

00:42:10.672 --> 00:42:12.420
Have you checked over there?

00:42:12.456 --> 00:42:13.456
Did you find Chat?

00:42:13.488 --> 00:42:15.340
(When that piles up, )

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:17.256
(it turns into rancor.)

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:18.928
No.

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:22.096
Let’s check over there.

00:42:22.144 --> 00:42:23.144
Yeah.

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.240
Urgh.

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:31.720
(Until you misunderstand and think)

00:42:32.496 --> 00:42:34.500
(that you probably don’t love them anymore.)

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:38.392
(When in reality, )

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:40.032
(if you didn’t love them, )

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:42.400
(you wouldn’t hate them this much.)

00:42:42.432 --> 00:42:45.088
Chat has always been a villain in our eyes.

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:48.000
But in reality,

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:50.864
maybe no one is better than the other.

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:57.048
(Because we’re sisters.)

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.472
(And sisters are enemies)

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:09.184
(who both hate)

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:12.808
(and love each other endlessly.)

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:02.824
(Until death do us part.)
