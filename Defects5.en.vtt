00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.999
Yum Jung-ah

00:00:11.918 --> 00:00:13.584
Won Jin-ah

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.876
Chou Young-jun

00:00:20.876 --> 00:00:21.959
Kim Jin-young

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:31.999
The Defects

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:51.500
Mom.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.999
Yes?

00:00:55.876 --> 00:00:57.709
Why is my name Ah-hyena?

00:00:58.876 --> 00:01:00.667
Because I said so.

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:07.209
Then what does my name mean?

00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:11.876
'Ah' means 'me',
and 'hyena' means 'shine'.

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:15.167
So it means 'I will shine'?

00:01:19.292 --> 00:01:23.876
No, it means you're the child
who'll make me shine.

00:01:28.626 --> 00:01:31.083
Why did you come here, huh?

00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:32.999
You should've died then.

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:41.999
How are you still alive?

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:44.709
Was I supposed to die?

00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:47.584
What's the reason for you to live?

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.250
How could you, Mom...

00:01:52.417 --> 00:01:54.999
How could you go that far?

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:58.459
'Mom'...?

00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:00.918
What does that even mean?

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.167
Useless child.

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:10.876
The Defects
EPEE. Useful Child

00:02:10.918 --> 00:02:14.000
The Bioethics Act,
aka the 'Eye Shopping Bill',

00:02:14.042 --> 00:02:18.334
has recorded over
500,000 people opposing in petition.

00:02:18.375 --> 00:02:21.999
Opposition parties are now
actively protesting the bill.

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:24.999
So what is this bill exactly?

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:27.999
It's an inhumane law that has gotten
a lot of attention lately,

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:31.751
which is cloaked as
a scientific progress.

00:02:31.792 --> 00:02:34.792
It ultimately legalizes
egg and sperm trading,

00:02:34.834 --> 00:02:39.167
and allows for the genetic
and gender editing of fetuses.

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.792
You can't just call it inhumane.

00:02:41.834 --> 00:02:45.834
According to research,
the bill could offer a breakthrough

00:02:45.876 --> 00:02:48.918
to Korea's plummeting birthrate crisis.

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.667
Which research are you referring to?

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.626
Even our president
insists on being child-free.

00:02:54.667 --> 00:02:59.459
Korea is on the verge of extinction
with the fertility rate of below 0.6.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.999
In this crisis, the Eye Shopping Bill...

00:03:02.792 --> 00:03:07.167
Of course... I was wondering
when my story would be brought up.

00:03:09.626 --> 00:03:11.167
Should you really be drinking?

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.999
I'd prefer if you didn't
before your sperm collection.

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:16.876
This much is fine.

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.584
No, it's not.

00:03:30.876 --> 00:03:33.751
When should I start wearing
the prosthetic belly?

00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:37.542
To make it look like I'm pregnant.

00:03:39.417 --> 00:03:41.042
I should gain
some weight too, right?

00:03:43.626 --> 00:03:45.792
How about quitting alcohol first?

00:03:46.334 --> 00:03:48.667
I'm not the one getting pregnant.

00:03:50.083 --> 00:03:53.292
The girl who's getting pregnant...

00:03:54.292 --> 00:03:57.042
Is she really Kim Se-her’s
birth-daughter?

00:03:57.417 --> 00:03:59.500
Yeah, we confirmed it.

00:03:59.876 --> 00:04:01.999
She's smart and a total prodigy.

00:04:03.667 --> 00:04:05.584
Pretty like her mom too.

00:04:05.626 --> 00:04:08.999
Still, even if she's blinded by ambition...

00:04:09.292 --> 00:04:12.250
How could she give up
her own daughter like that?

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:14.417
She's just a kid...

00:04:17.375 --> 00:04:21.999
Honey, I'll relay what she said.

00:04:25.125 --> 00:04:26.417
Madam Lady.

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:31.042
Do you know when Virgin Mary
gave birth to Jesus?

00:04:33.626 --> 00:04:35.500
She was fourteen.

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:40.042
Isn't this all God's miraculous plan?

00:04:43.083 --> 00:04:48.459
Heavenly Father full of love,
have mercy on us...

00:04:51.876 --> 00:04:54.000
Fine, I understand.

00:05:00.125 --> 00:05:01.292
But honey...

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:07.375
Shouldn't we meet the girl
at least once?

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:18.417
Just hold on, it's not dangerous.
I swear it's not.

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:20.083
I'm sorry, Ah-hyena.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.083
Just a little longer,
nothing will happen.

00:05:23.626 --> 00:05:25.918
So-mi, can you take off the tape?

00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:28.999
Yeah, right?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:31.999
What are you doing?
Who are you people?

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:34.999
Si-woo, what happened to you?

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:39.999
Listen, I'll explain everything.
So please... Please...

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:44.375
Please help us.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.167
Our sister is trapped in there.

00:05:48.667 --> 00:05:49.626
What?

00:05:49.667 --> 00:05:51.083
Your mom is trying to kill our sister.

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:54.959
No, it must be a misunderstanding.

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:56.250
Our mom would never...

00:05:58.209 --> 00:06:00.375
No, she would never!

00:06:03.292 --> 00:06:05.792
Hey, Ah-hyena is in danger.

00:06:05.834 --> 00:06:07.918
And we really need your help.

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:09.834
We're going to trade you
for Ah-hyena.

00:06:10.083 --> 00:06:11.584
Ah-hyena?

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:17.999
Who's that...?

00:06:24.876 --> 00:06:27.626
I want to meet Ah-hyena in person.

00:06:27.667 --> 00:06:28.999
Did you know?

00:06:30.792 --> 00:06:33.292
The current Ah-hyena
is extremely useful.

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:48.999
Mom!

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Stay away!
I said, stay away!

00:06:52.042 --> 00:06:53.500
What are you doing?

00:06:53.542 --> 00:06:54.999
Let our sister go!

00:06:56.292 --> 00:06:57.626
Mom...

00:06:58.792 --> 00:07:00.209
Stay the hell away!

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.999
Mom...

00:07:03.918 --> 00:07:06.542
I want to meet Ah-hyena in person.

00:07:10.209 --> 00:07:11.292
Let her go.

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:18.500
- Ah-hyena...
- Ah-hyena!

00:07:21.792 --> 00:07:22.999
Hey, are you okay?

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:29.042
You alright?

00:07:30.417 --> 00:07:32.375
Oh, no... Ah-hyena...

00:07:32.417 --> 00:07:33.834
Hurry!

00:07:35.999 --> 00:07:36.999
Let's go.

00:07:54.667 --> 00:07:57.417
You okay?
Did you get hurt?

00:07:58.542 --> 00:07:59.876
Mom...

00:08:01.083 --> 00:08:03.125
Yes, my dear Ah-hyena.

00:08:04.125 --> 00:08:06.709
My daughter, you're okay.

00:08:07.959 --> 00:08:09.999
Ah-hyena! Ah-hyena?

00:08:13.042 --> 00:08:15.459
- Take her.
- Yes.

00:08:27.042 --> 00:08:28.500
Holy crap, are you okay?

00:08:28.542 --> 00:08:30.125
Wake up, Ah-hyena!

00:08:30.167 --> 00:08:31.459
Is she okay?

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.999
Hey, drive faster!

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.542
- Hurry up already!
- Ah-hyena...

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.459
Did you hear her?
She called me 'Mom'.

00:08:47.999 --> 00:08:50.542
Pf ft, 'Mom'...

00:08:50.999 --> 00:08:52.125
So sick of it.

00:08:52.626 --> 00:08:55.751
We'll find and
dispose of them immediately.

00:08:56.417 --> 00:08:57.999
No, leave them.

00:08:58.999 --> 00:09:00.999
They might actually be of use.

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:06.999
Didn't they seem to be
searching for their parents?

00:09:25.334 --> 00:09:26.751
She must've been shaken.

00:09:28.209 --> 00:09:30.125
Good thing she didn't get hurt.

00:09:30.667 --> 00:09:33.999
What if she had gotten a scar?
Tomorrow's the meeting.

00:09:35.125 --> 00:09:37.542
Don't let her out
when she gets pregnant.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.250
Yes, ma'am.

00:09:40.999 --> 00:09:43.999
I guess once you're pregnant at fourteen,
you can't even go outside.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.667
If you ever need help,
make sure to call me.

00:10:29.167 --> 00:10:30.709
- Piggyback her.
- Can you move?

00:10:30.751 --> 00:10:31.500
- Here.
- Come on.

00:10:37.626 --> 00:10:38.999
She won't stop bleeding.

00:10:44.542 --> 00:10:45.584
Let me see.

00:10:45.626 --> 00:10:47.125
That woman earlier...

00:10:47.751 --> 00:10:49.334
Don't you think she is
Ah-Hyperion’s mom?

00:10:49.999 --> 00:10:51.125
No way.

00:10:54.209 --> 00:10:56.000
That was Ah-hyena.

00:10:56.042 --> 00:10:58.999
The person who was in front of her.

00:11:00.209 --> 00:11:02.542
Show love to the children.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.125
Let them know through your eyes.

00:11:06.876 --> 00:11:08.083
Children who are loved...

00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:10.709
- Are you watching this again?
- ...return it twofold.

00:11:10.751 --> 00:11:12.500
I love you, my girl.

00:11:13.042 --> 00:11:15.292
Mommy loves you.

00:11:15.999 --> 00:11:19.999
So the woman Ah-hyena
watched on TV was...

00:11:21.209 --> 00:11:23.999
But, why would she...?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.459
- Ah-hyena?
- Ah-hyena!

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.834
Ah-hyena!

00:11:32.876 --> 00:11:33.999
- Ah-hyena! Ah-hyena!
- Take her to the hospital!

00:11:33.999 --> 00:11:35.834
- Not the hospital!
- Then what do we do?

00:11:35.876 --> 00:11:38.709
We have to save her!
Let's go...

00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:40.167
Dr. Park!

00:11:41.751 --> 00:11:42.999
Let's call Dr. Park.

00:11:44.876 --> 00:11:49.834
Yeah, the doctor that the old man called.
Right, let's call Dr. Park.

00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:52.250
- She won't answer.
- What do you mean?

00:11:52.292 --> 00:11:54.292
She never moves without money!

00:11:54.334 --> 00:11:56.999
Just call,
we have to save her life!

00:11:57.459 --> 00:11:59.417
She's a doctor,
she must have a conscience.

00:12:00.083 --> 00:12:03.167
Whatever, I'll figure it out.
I'm going to him no matter what.

00:12:03.667 --> 00:12:06.999
Please!
We have to think it through!

00:12:06.999 --> 00:12:08.792
I don't care!
I'll go alone if I have to!

00:12:24.292 --> 00:12:27.876
Topper Sushi Restaurant

00:12:37.999 --> 00:12:39.250
Welcome.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.792
Choi Hyeong-seok,
National Police Agency

00:12:51.542 --> 00:12:52.792
Do you know these kids?

00:12:53.334 --> 00:12:55.292
What is it you want?

00:12:57.334 --> 00:12:58.751
Woo Tae-sik.

00:12:59.999 --> 00:13:01.375
We're looking for Woo Tae-sik.

00:13:02.999 --> 00:13:05.999
Sorry, I don't know him either.

00:13:07.584 --> 00:13:10.167
I know Woo Tae-sik
was their guardian.

00:13:10.959 --> 00:13:14.709
Shouldn't at least one adult
be there to help these kids?

00:13:17.999 --> 00:13:21.667
Is there any way
to reach them?

00:13:32.417 --> 00:13:33.626
10

00:13:34.999 --> 00:13:36.209
9

00:13:36.834 --> 00:13:38.250
8

00:13:40.999 --> 00:13:44.125
Come on,
you can hold longer.

00:13:47.999 --> 00:13:48.999
10

00:13:50.375 --> 00:13:51.918
9

00:13:53.167 --> 00:13:54.334
8

00:13:55.667 --> 00:13:56.999
7

00:13:57.999 --> 00:13:59.584
Don't come out!

00:14:25.999 --> 00:14:27.876
You useless brat.

00:14:45.042 --> 00:14:46.999
She's burning up.

00:14:47.209 --> 00:14:48.876
I don't think she can last.

00:14:49.083 --> 00:14:52.542
Guys, let's call Dr. Park.

00:14:53.999 --> 00:14:56.334
Ju-an, let's go to the church.

00:14:56.792 --> 00:14:58.834
We need to get some money.

00:15:02.334 --> 00:15:03.500
Ju-an...

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:08.792
Is that really... the only way?

00:15:10.125 --> 00:15:11.584
Coward.

00:15:12.209 --> 00:15:13.250
What?

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.876
I said you're a coward.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.999
- You done talking?
- No, not even close.

00:15:21.209 --> 00:15:23.459
What if something happens to her
while you hesitate?

00:15:23.751 --> 00:15:24.834
Will you take responsibility?

00:15:24.876 --> 00:15:26.000
So-mi...

00:15:26.417 --> 00:15:29.083
I'm terrified something might happen to her!

00:15:29.125 --> 00:15:30.999
Just shut up!

00:15:33.083 --> 00:15:35.542
If you don't know, don't talk.

00:15:36.999 --> 00:15:39.209
Don't speak carelessly
about other people's pain.

00:15:39.999 --> 00:15:42.000
You have no clue
what I went through.

00:15:42.042 --> 00:15:43.626
You think I don't?

00:15:43.999 --> 00:15:47.167
You beg and scream every night.

00:15:48.083 --> 00:15:50.709
Didn't you know?
We all did.

00:15:51.999 --> 00:15:53.250
What?

00:15:53.999 --> 00:15:56.626
God, forgive me.

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:59.292
Jesus, please save me!
I'm sorry!

00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:00.959
Father!

00:16:02.999 --> 00:16:04.959
Every night.
How can we not know?

00:16:07.999 --> 00:16:12.167
Are you going to keep
running away out of fear?

00:16:13.542 --> 00:16:15.417
Just going to keep hiding?

00:16:16.584 --> 00:16:18.125
Pretending it never happened?

00:16:23.751 --> 00:16:25.167
It's time to face it.

00:16:28.999 --> 00:16:31.626
You have to confront it head-on!

00:16:33.042 --> 00:16:34.292
And you're...

00:16:36.167 --> 00:16:37.834
You're not alone anymore.

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:43.999
You were alone before.

00:16:44.999 --> 00:16:46.500
But now, we're together.

00:16:50.918 --> 00:16:53.167
So come with me,
let's go together.

00:17:08.209 --> 00:17:10.751
Oh, you're awake already?

00:17:11.292 --> 00:17:12.542
Sit down.

00:17:26.918 --> 00:17:28.459
Eat well, darling.

00:17:29.709 --> 00:17:30.999
Yeah.

00:17:30.999 --> 00:17:32.626
Were you shocked yesterday?

00:17:35.417 --> 00:17:38.375
I'll assign you a bodyguard.
Don't worry too much.

00:17:40.876 --> 00:17:44.292
Sometimes in life,
things don't go according to plan.

00:17:44.959 --> 00:17:47.709
The people from yesterday
misunderstood Mom somehow.

00:17:50.459 --> 00:17:51.584
I see...

00:17:53.459 --> 00:17:56.876
Eat, we'll get ready slowly.

00:17:56.918 --> 00:17:58.459
I'm taking you somewhere today.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.999
- Where?
- You'll see.

00:18:02.417 --> 00:18:05.375
By the way,
I withdrew you from school.

00:18:06.709 --> 00:18:10.292
I want you to study abroad,
starting next year.

00:18:19.459 --> 00:18:21.918
Shoulder gunshot,
woman in her 20s, blood type Os.

00:18:21.959 --> 00:18:24.042
- Location?
- Yeomen-dong factory district.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:25.542
500,000 won.

00:18:25.584 --> 00:18:26.999
I'll pay you right after surgery.

00:18:26.999 --> 00:18:28.667
Please make your way now.

00:18:30.999 --> 00:18:32.167
Let's go.

00:18:34.042 --> 00:18:36.918
Thank you,
I'll see you in the chapel.

00:18:36.959 --> 00:18:38.918
Good morning, Deacon!

00:18:38.959 --> 00:18:40.999
Thank you.

00:18:41.334 --> 00:18:44.042
Oh, Elder!
How's your health?

00:18:44.083 --> 00:18:46.999
Much better.
Looking forward to your sermon.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.959
Yes, go on in.
Up you go.

00:18:49.292 --> 00:18:51.000
Oh, Pastor!

00:18:51.042 --> 00:18:53.999
My son got into Seoul National University.

00:18:53.999 --> 00:18:54.999
Congratulations!

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.417
It's all thanks to you and your wife.

00:18:57.459 --> 00:18:59.667
Accept our special offering.

00:19:10.459 --> 00:19:11.667
Hey, Ju-an!

00:19:12.667 --> 00:19:14.250
What are you doing?
Let's go.

00:19:16.959 --> 00:19:22.959
Our Lord is deeply saddened
by those who sin out of greed.

00:19:23.167 --> 00:19:25.209
He weeps for them,
brothers and sisters!

00:19:26.709 --> 00:19:29.334
God tells us to store
our treasures in Heaven,

00:19:29.375 --> 00:19:32.083
for the sake of us all!

00:19:32.792 --> 00:19:34.999
The place closest to God!

00:19:34.999 --> 00:19:36.584
The place connected to him!

00:19:37.459 --> 00:19:42.709
That very place is this church,
dear congregation!

00:19:42.999 --> 00:19:43.999
Amen.

00:19:44.375 --> 00:19:47.999
Now, let's all entrust
our treasures to the Lord.

00:19:48.584 --> 00:19:51.834
Through the blood of the lamb,
for us foolish humans,

00:19:51.876 --> 00:19:54.959
God graciously blesses us all!

00:19:55.083 --> 00:19:56.999
Let's give a prayer of thanks!

00:19:57.918 --> 00:19:58.834
Let us pray.

00:19:58.876 --> 00:19:59.999
Nobody coming?

00:20:02.083 --> 00:20:03.999
Our Father in heaven,

00:20:04.459 --> 00:20:07.542
thank you for allowing us
to praise you.

00:20:07.584 --> 00:20:11.292
In memory of the late Ju Eun-gyeol
2nd Memorial Service

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.083
Hey.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.375
What did you pray about?

00:20:45.876 --> 00:20:46.918
Huh?

00:20:51.709 --> 00:20:53.000
I just...

00:20:54.626 --> 00:20:56.417
I pray everyday...

00:20:58.542 --> 00:20:59.999
...to become closer to you.

00:21:05.125 --> 00:21:07.542
In memory of the late Ju Eun-gyeol
2nd Memorial Service

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:22.584
I want to be close with you too.

00:21:28.125 --> 00:21:29.626
Let us pray!

00:21:29.667 --> 00:21:30.834
Got it.

00:21:31.375 --> 00:21:33.375
Dear heavenly Father...

00:21:34.959 --> 00:21:37.250
Jew-an! Hey!
What are you doing?

00:21:37.918 --> 00:21:40.125
Let's go.
Snap out of it!

00:21:40.584 --> 00:21:41.584
Hey!

00:21:43.375 --> 00:21:45.999
You told us to store up our treasures!

00:21:49.167 --> 00:21:50.375
Our congregation!

00:21:50.417 --> 00:21:51.334
What's wrong with him?

00:21:51.375 --> 00:21:53.042
Property! Greed!

00:21:54.751 --> 00:21:55.999
Jew-an!

00:21:59.709 --> 00:22:00.999
Are you okay?

00:22:00.999 --> 00:22:03.334
Ju-an, seriously!
What's wrong with you?

00:22:03.792 --> 00:22:04.999
Why are you acting like this?

00:22:07.751 --> 00:22:09.125
Let us pray.

00:22:09.792 --> 00:22:13.999
Dear gracious God,
we are here today

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:17.999
to thank you for allowing us
to worship and praise you.

00:22:17.999 --> 00:22:20.999
Oh my! Fire!

00:22:20.999 --> 00:22:23.584
Pastor, there's a fire!
In the offering box!

00:22:23.626 --> 00:22:26.042
Fire? What do you mean fire?
What fire?

00:22:26.375 --> 00:22:27.709
Excuse me! Excuse me!

00:22:28.999 --> 00:22:30.083
Get the fire extinguisher!

00:22:31.584 --> 00:22:32.999
Why is it lit on fire?

00:22:32.999 --> 00:22:35.125
Why is the offering box on fire?
Who did this?

00:22:35.167 --> 00:22:37.999
Bring the extinguisher, now!
Right now!

00:22:37.999 --> 00:22:39.083
What do we do?

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.459
Who the hell set fire
to the treasure box?

00:22:46.334 --> 00:22:48.876
Why? Why? Why?

00:23:00.959 --> 00:23:03.500
You're glowing, dear.

00:23:05.999 --> 00:23:06.999
Ah-hyena.

00:23:08.209 --> 00:23:11.292
You'll be a useful daughter, right?

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:14.000
Yes, of course.

00:23:17.042 --> 00:23:19.375
Mom really needs you right now.

00:23:19.999 --> 00:23:23.999
You can help Mom, right?
Can you?

00:23:24.792 --> 00:23:25.999
Of course, Mom.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.000
Thank you.

00:23:53.667 --> 00:23:54.918
You're here!

00:24:05.999 --> 00:24:08.542
Nice to meet you, Ah-hyena.

00:24:11.542 --> 00:24:12.918
My Maria.

00:24:18.042 --> 00:24:19.000
Come in.

00:24:30.959 --> 00:24:32.042
Madam Lady.

00:24:32.918 --> 00:24:34.459
May I pour the tea?

00:24:37.083 --> 00:24:38.042
Go ahead.

00:24:49.626 --> 00:24:52.959
She's young
but knows formal rites too?

00:24:54.584 --> 00:24:56.292
I give the most importance

00:24:56.334 --> 00:24:58.999
to teaching proper manner
above all else.

00:25:20.292 --> 00:25:25.375
You raised your daughter so well...

00:25:28.584 --> 00:25:30.542
It's the Lord's will.

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:33.292
Amen.

00:25:36.667 --> 00:25:37.999
Oh, right!

00:25:39.375 --> 00:25:41.083
I almost forgot the most important thing.

00:25:42.999 --> 00:25:46.542
Mm... The physical condition.

00:25:47.626 --> 00:25:49.083
It can be done, right?

00:25:51.999 --> 00:25:53.042
I mean...

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.792
She started menstruating
around this time last year.

00:26:01.375 --> 00:26:03.292
There's no need to worry.

00:26:04.083 --> 00:26:05.500
Of course.

00:26:06.999 --> 00:26:07.999
Right?

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.626
Sister.

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:17.000
May I speak with Ah-hyena in private?

00:26:52.334 --> 00:26:53.709
Ah-hyena.

00:26:58.167 --> 00:27:00.459
If you're not comfortable with it,

00:27:01.125 --> 00:27:02.459
we can stop...

00:27:02.999 --> 00:27:06.959
No, it's what I want.

00:27:08.125 --> 00:27:09.292
Really?

00:27:11.125 --> 00:27:12.542
Truly?

00:27:15.626 --> 00:27:18.083
I was so worried
you might not want it.

00:27:18.125 --> 00:27:20.834
I've felt so guilty.

00:27:23.209 --> 00:27:24.918
Aren't you scared?

00:27:25.999 --> 00:27:27.417
Or afraid?

00:27:28.626 --> 00:27:30.292
It's what my mom wants.

00:27:31.999 --> 00:27:36.999
And what she wants
is also what I want.

00:27:37.834 --> 00:27:41.999
I want to be a daughter
that's useful to my mom.

00:27:42.999 --> 00:27:44.334
Oh my...

00:27:44.999 --> 00:27:51.918
I hope I can have a daughter
just like you someday.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.999
You will, very soon.

00:28:01.918 --> 00:28:02.999
Thank you.

00:28:05.751 --> 00:28:06.709
Thank you so much.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:38.918
She's passed
the critical stage for now.

00:28:40.292 --> 00:28:42.209
But she lost too much blood.

00:28:43.999 --> 00:28:44.999
Your old man isn't here.

00:28:47.709 --> 00:28:49.542
One more in the family, though.

00:28:51.959 --> 00:28:53.375
Will Ah-hyena be okay?

00:28:53.999 --> 00:28:55.250
We'll have to wait and see.

00:28:55.292 --> 00:28:58.375
Anyone else hurt?

00:29:02.792 --> 00:29:03.417
You?

00:29:05.125 --> 00:29:08.999
If you're done here, please go.
And don't tell anyone about us.

00:29:12.375 --> 00:29:15.334
Same goes the other way.

00:29:17.999 --> 00:29:20.667
Who are you kids?

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.042
SCSI procedure complete.
Beginning embryo culture.

00:29:43.209 --> 00:29:44.584
Congratulations, Director.

00:29:45.626 --> 00:29:48.999
I don't know.
I'm not expecting much.

00:29:48.999 --> 00:29:50.999
What's so special
about presidential genes?

00:29:50.999 --> 00:29:52.999
I'm just doing this to feel better.

00:29:53.459 --> 00:29:56.876
Maybe someday,
a perfect child will appear.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.375
Good job, everyone.

00:30:06.083 --> 00:30:09.584
As of 3 p.m. today,
the Bioethics Act revision,

00:30:09.626 --> 00:30:13.167
also known as the 'Eye Shopping Bill'
has passed the Judiciary Committee.

00:30:13.209 --> 00:30:17.000
Is the ruling party going to
push it through the plenary session?

00:30:17.042 --> 00:30:18.000
Yes, that's correct.

00:30:18.042 --> 00:30:23.500
The opposition party said they'll use
all means to block it including filibusters.

00:30:23.542 --> 00:30:26.834
A clash between the parties
in the plenary session seems inevitable.

00:30:26.876 --> 00:30:28.999
What happens if the bill
passes the plenary session?

00:30:28.999 --> 00:30:32.292
Will buying and selling children
really become possible?

00:30:32.334 --> 00:30:33.999
Yes, that's correct.

00:30:33.999 --> 00:30:38.709
Religious groups, civic organizations,
and the opposition party fear this.

00:30:38.751 --> 00:30:44.542
The justification of advancing biotechnology
is believed to be an excuse by many.

00:31:21.918 --> 00:31:24.417
What is this place?

00:31:24.459 --> 00:31:27.500
You'll find out.
Come with me.

00:31:46.999 --> 00:31:50.334
Did the defects really do this?

00:31:50.375 --> 00:31:54.584
Yeah, they're not kids.
They're total delinquents.

00:31:54.626 --> 00:31:57.083
Congrats on
the Judiciary Committee approval.

00:31:58.042 --> 00:31:59.125
Hello, ma'am.

00:32:00.667 --> 00:32:03.542
You're the one that deserve
the congratulations.

00:32:04.876 --> 00:32:07.626
The plenary session won't be a problem.

00:32:07.667 --> 00:32:10.584
People are calling it unethical
because they're new to it.

00:32:11.626 --> 00:32:16.250
But it's the law of nature that
the weak loses and the strong wins, right?

00:32:17.626 --> 00:32:20.000
We're following nature's order.
What's their problem?

00:32:20.042 --> 00:32:21.459
Amen.

00:32:22.959 --> 00:32:25.042
Ugh, what a mess.

00:32:26.417 --> 00:32:29.709
Thankfully, the important ones
will be moved to the new lab.

00:32:30.125 --> 00:32:33.751
Today, I want to show
the Congressman something.

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:42.292
These are embryos
from artificial fertilization.

00:32:42.709 --> 00:32:45.876
Only one of them is usable.

00:32:45.918 --> 00:32:47.959
See? That one clearly stands out.

00:32:47.999 --> 00:32:49.417
What about the rest?

00:32:50.459 --> 00:32:51.667
Waste.

00:32:53.125 --> 00:32:57.918
Christians believe each embryo
has a soul.

00:32:58.167 --> 00:32:59.999
They say it's life given by God.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:07.209
That's why some people protest
against artificial fertilization like zealots.

00:33:08.999 --> 00:33:11.999
But when the world changes,
people's minds change too.

00:33:12.792 --> 00:33:16.042
Changing people's minds first
won't get us anywhere.

00:33:16.918 --> 00:33:17.959
It'll be too late.

00:33:17.999 --> 00:33:18.999
You're right.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.459
Think of it as a contribution to
helping build a new world.

00:33:23.959 --> 00:33:25.000
What?

00:33:25.999 --> 00:33:28.375
You thought I was just
a crazy businesswoman,

00:33:28.417 --> 00:33:30.999
but now you think I'm a psycho,
don't you?

00:33:40.459 --> 00:33:45.000
This one was refunded because
of a heart defect.

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:48.500
This one was refunded
because the parents divorced.

00:33:50.209 --> 00:33:52.542
This one had a critical error.

00:33:52.584 --> 00:33:54.918
It carried an ADD gene.

00:34:19.083 --> 00:34:20.999
Do you get what I'm saying?

00:34:21.334 --> 00:34:26.375
We should've picked out the good genes
and combined them from the start.

00:34:27.417 --> 00:34:30.125
Then we wouldn't have wastes like these.

00:34:31.334 --> 00:34:34.250
So I'm going to do just that.

00:34:58.834 --> 00:35:00.999
See? I told you I'm crazy.

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:05.709
It's always the crazy ones
that change the world.

00:35:18.999 --> 00:35:23.167
I guess not all politicians
have the guts like they say.

00:35:24.709 --> 00:35:29.375
He's so weak.
How will he do anything?

00:35:29.999 --> 00:35:31.999
So, you wanted to see me privately?

00:35:31.999 --> 00:35:38.083
Actually, it took me quite a while
to bring the president and first lady

00:35:38.125 --> 00:35:40.042
into our church as members.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:44.292
Besides the time spent,
I had to put in effort everywhere.

00:35:44.334 --> 00:35:46.292
Full devotion.

00:35:46.792 --> 00:35:49.709
I assumed the funding was sufficient.

00:35:51.167 --> 00:35:52.999
Amen, amen! Of course!

00:35:53.542 --> 00:35:56.959
You have been so generous
with your salvation offerings.

00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:03.999
Once the bill passes, you'll be busy
commercializing the Eye Shopping Bill.

00:36:03.999 --> 00:36:08.250
If you'd just entrust me
with the bank...

00:36:09.959 --> 00:36:10.999
The bank?

00:36:10.999 --> 00:36:14.999
Yes, the sperm and egg bank
you mentioned.

00:36:15.834 --> 00:36:20.834
If we could later expand it
with other new services

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.959
from adoption to revocation...

00:36:23.709 --> 00:36:24.959
Pastor.

00:36:25.417 --> 00:36:27.167
That's a great idea.

00:36:28.626 --> 00:36:30.375
Truly a great idea.

00:36:30.417 --> 00:36:32.959
I'll grant you your wish.

00:36:34.667 --> 00:36:37.083
Amen! Amen!
Thank you, Lord!

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:50.999
Ah-hyena, you okay?

00:36:52.999 --> 00:36:54.167
Hey everyone...

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:57.792
Careful.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.542
What happened?

00:37:11.999 --> 00:37:12.999
Who treated me?

00:37:12.999 --> 00:37:14.334
Dr. Park came by.

00:37:14.999 --> 00:37:15.999
What?

00:37:17.876 --> 00:37:19.375
Where did you get the money?

00:37:20.626 --> 00:37:22.876
Me and Ju-an are great
at cracking safes.

00:37:25.999 --> 00:37:27.999
Why'd you take such a huge risk?

00:37:28.334 --> 00:37:31.626
Thank God...
I'm glad you woke up.

00:37:36.999 --> 00:37:39.584
Ah-hyena, here.

00:37:40.876 --> 00:37:42.459
- Let me see.
- There.

00:37:44.626 --> 00:37:48.042
I'm Detective Choi Hyeong-seok.
Please call me.

00:37:48.709 --> 00:37:50.542
He's been trying to reach you
while you were out.

00:38:06.584 --> 00:38:07.999
Why are you outside?

00:38:15.999 --> 00:38:16.999
Ah-hyena...

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.042
I thought if I ever met him again,

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:28.999
I'd be able to stand tall,

00:38:30.751 --> 00:38:32.334
and get my revenge.

00:38:36.999 --> 00:38:38.999
But when the moment came,
I couldn't.

00:38:40.375 --> 00:38:41.918
I was so terrified.

00:38:45.999 --> 00:38:48.792
His eyes...
They were terrifying.

00:38:51.751 --> 00:38:54.792
It was better when we
were living in hiding.

00:38:55.626 --> 00:38:58.125
Eating good food with the old man...

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.709
Playing games...

00:39:01.999 --> 00:39:03.667
That life was much better.

00:39:05.876 --> 00:39:06.999
I felt the same.

00:39:09.125 --> 00:39:10.500
I was scared.

00:39:18.167 --> 00:39:19.292
But Ju-an...

00:39:21.626 --> 00:39:25.209
The thought of us
living in hiding forever...

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:26.999
...is even more scarier.

00:39:31.584 --> 00:39:33.000
Why do we have to run?

00:39:34.999 --> 00:39:36.584
We didn't do anything wrong.

00:39:41.999 --> 00:39:44.334
We have to face it
head-on from now.

00:39:44.999 --> 00:39:48.167
That includes me and all of you.

00:39:49.751 --> 00:39:51.959
I'm not going to let us
keep living in hiding anymore.

00:39:54.792 --> 00:39:56.500
We deserve a normal life.

00:39:59.375 --> 00:40:00.959
A fresh start.

00:40:03.667 --> 00:40:04.959
We'll make it happen.

00:40:26.999 --> 00:40:27.999
Hello.

00:40:40.626 --> 00:40:41.584
You ready?

00:40:44.751 --> 00:40:45.876
Let's go.

00:40:53.792 --> 00:40:54.709
Can you see it?

00:40:54.751 --> 00:40:55.834
Yeah.

00:41:11.209 --> 00:41:14.876
Remember the fire?
I found us a famous shaman.

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:17.834
They say she's legit,
should we try it?

00:41:17.999 --> 00:41:19.959
What do you mean, shaman?
That's nonsense.

00:41:19.999 --> 00:41:21.250
I'm a pastor, for God's sake.

00:41:21.292 --> 00:41:22.751
Everyone does it.

00:41:24.626 --> 00:41:27.250
Elder Yoko In-jun,
5 million won!

00:41:28.667 --> 00:41:30.209
Amazing!

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:31.999
Business must be going well.

00:41:32.999 --> 00:41:35.459
Deaconess Om Soon-ha,
1 million won...

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:38.999
- I thought her shop was doing well.
- Yeah...

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.751
Kim Chin-nae... 50,000 won?

00:41:41.792 --> 00:41:42.792
What?

00:41:42.834 --> 00:41:46.999
Come on, he owns a building!
Is he joking with us?

00:41:46.999 --> 00:41:49.751
He's crazy.
What a wanker.

00:41:50.584 --> 00:41:51.584
Yun Ji-seok?

00:41:52.999 --> 00:41:54.042
No way...

00:41:56.999 --> 00:42:00.042
You killed Eun-gyeol...

00:42:03.209 --> 00:42:04.999
That crazy bastard.

00:42:05.584 --> 00:42:07.375
Soon Jo-seek, that bastard!

00:42:08.792 --> 00:42:10.375
That fucking bitch!

00:42:18.125 --> 00:42:20.250
Angkor Shaman House
We lift curses for you

00:42:43.999 --> 00:42:44.834
Get out!

00:42:45.626 --> 00:42:46.999
Huh? Why?

00:42:46.999 --> 00:42:49.584
A servant of the big god
has no business here.

00:42:50.667 --> 00:42:53.209
There's no big or small gods...

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:56.459
We just follow whatever god
is needed at the time.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.999
Can you tell where he is?

00:43:03.876 --> 00:43:04.876
The boy?

00:43:06.751 --> 00:43:08.334
The boy, you say...

00:43:19.167 --> 00:43:20.250
You bastards!

00:43:21.792 --> 00:43:24.209
The sinner is your son!

00:43:24.999 --> 00:43:29.292
Yes, he's my son...
I mean, he was my son.

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:32.000
And he needs to die now.

00:43:34.584 --> 00:43:36.417
Ff...

00:43:37.792 --> 00:43:39.042
Heartless monsters.

00:43:39.083 --> 00:43:43.999
Do you want a talisman?
Or a killing ritual?

00:43:43.999 --> 00:43:46.626
Anything.
Anything possible, right now.

00:43:50.999 --> 00:43:51.834
You!

00:44:00.334 --> 00:44:03.834
If you want results,

00:44:03.876 --> 00:44:04.999
place this talisman
under your church's cross.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.125
You need to subdue
the spirit of your god.

00:44:09.876 --> 00:44:10.918
Ah, okay.

00:44:12.542 --> 00:44:13.834
Thank you!

00:44:14.459 --> 00:44:15.584
Amen.

00:44:15.626 --> 00:44:16.999
Thank you!

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:25.792
Ugh, gosh...

00:44:25.999 --> 00:44:26.999
Well done.

00:44:26.999 --> 00:44:29.999
Those idiots happily took the talisman.

00:44:30.292 --> 00:44:33.375
What exactly is their religion?

00:44:35.042 --> 00:44:36.292
Money, of course.

00:44:37.626 --> 00:44:38.584
Let's go.

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:44.751
Dear heavenly Father,

00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:47.167
On this anniversary

00:44:47.876 --> 00:44:49.542
we miss Eun-gyeol dearly

00:44:49.584 --> 00:44:53.999
and pray that his soul may rest forever

00:44:53.999 --> 00:44:55.584
in peace and in your embrace.

00:44:55.959 --> 00:44:59.292
We pray in the name of our Lord,

00:44:59.334 --> 00:45:01.876
Jesus Christ,

00:45:01.918 --> 00:45:03.834
Amen.

00:45:10.375 --> 00:45:15.125
Eun-gyeol was
my son Jo-Seoul’s best friend.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.792
So on this day every year,
we gather and pray.

00:45:20.083 --> 00:45:22.542
Hoping our Ji-seok
might be found again.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.999
It is my sincere hope.

00:45:27.042 --> 00:45:28.667
Do you think Eun-gyeol knows?

00:45:29.667 --> 00:45:31.792
Where my Ji-seok is?

00:45:31.834 --> 00:45:32.999
Ji-seok!

00:45:34.417 --> 00:45:36.167
He'll be found, madam.

00:45:36.792 --> 00:45:39.125
I'm sure he's doing well.

00:45:39.626 --> 00:45:41.250
Thank you, Elder.

00:45:46.709 --> 00:45:48.999
He is finally found!

00:45:50.626 --> 00:45:51.999
I found Yoon Ji-seok!

00:45:54.125 --> 00:45:55.209
How dare you!

00:45:57.042 --> 00:45:58.999
You asked me to find your son!

00:45:58.999 --> 00:46:00.209
Let's take this outside.

00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:03.125
Hey! How dare you
touch a possessed body?

00:46:03.167 --> 00:46:06.167
I'm so sorry!
Please forgive me!

00:46:06.209 --> 00:46:09.999
You disrespectful brat!
You wicked child!

00:46:10.542 --> 00:46:11.542
Wait a minute.

00:46:11.584 --> 00:46:14.792
Did you hide my talisman
under the main cross?

00:46:15.167 --> 00:46:16.999
- A talisman, Pastor?
- Elder, no!

00:46:16.999 --> 00:46:19.999
This is a misunderstanding!
I'm a pastor!

00:46:19.999 --> 00:46:22.250
A talisman?
That's not true!

00:46:22.292 --> 00:46:23.999
- What's that?
- It's nothing!

00:46:23.999 --> 00:46:26.876
- What is this?
- Talisman! It's a talisman!

00:46:26.918 --> 00:46:30.125
Oh, Ji-seok!

00:46:30.667 --> 00:46:32.999
I found your son, Yoon Ji-seok!

00:46:33.918 --> 00:46:37.834
Ji-seok... Ji-seok...

00:46:37.876 --> 00:46:40.626
Why did you put this thing
on my robe?

00:46:40.918 --> 00:46:41.876
It's not like that...

00:46:42.999 --> 00:46:44.167
Your son, Ji-seok...

00:46:45.999 --> 00:46:47.167
He's in here!

00:46:51.959 --> 00:46:52.999
Ji-seok...

00:46:54.334 --> 00:46:55.500
He's alive?

00:46:55.999 --> 00:46:57.500
That son of a bitch...

00:46:59.417 --> 00:47:00.751
Hallelujah!

00:47:00.999 --> 00:47:02.459
Beloved brothers and sisters!

00:47:03.083 --> 00:47:05.876
The Lord has worked a miracle!

00:47:06.042 --> 00:47:08.918
God has performed a miracle!

00:47:09.125 --> 00:47:11.000
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

00:47:11.042 --> 00:47:15.417
Our earnest prayers
have been answered by the Lord!

00:47:16.083 --> 00:47:18.999
He has returned
our beloved Ji-seok to us!

00:47:19.292 --> 00:47:20.584
Hallelujah!

00:47:20.626 --> 00:47:22.876
Thank You, Father!

00:47:22.918 --> 00:47:25.209
You have shown us a miracle!

00:47:25.751 --> 00:47:27.999
Thank you heavenly Father...

00:47:28.209 --> 00:47:32.167
Ji-seok!
My Ji-seok, Ji-seok!

00:47:32.209 --> 00:47:34.459
You've come back to us,
my precious Ji-seok!

00:47:36.083 --> 00:47:37.626
How dare you come here?

00:47:44.292 --> 00:47:46.999
Pastor! Pastor!

00:48:00.999 --> 00:48:03.000
You filthy bastard.

00:48:03.042 --> 00:48:04.918
Stop it! That's enough!

00:48:08.834 --> 00:48:10.167
You're the filthy one.

00:48:10.959 --> 00:48:12.999
You money-grubbing pig.

00:48:16.375 --> 00:48:20.292
Yeah, what if I am?
So what?

00:48:20.999 --> 00:48:26.083
What about you?
You're into guys, you freak!

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:35.959
You animal!

00:48:36.042 --> 00:48:38.250
You psycho!

00:48:46.667 --> 00:48:49.876
If you want to stand proud
before the Lord,

00:48:50.209 --> 00:48:52.125
repent and beg for forgiveness.

00:48:52.709 --> 00:48:56.876
That's your only salvation,
you disgusting freak!

00:49:35.999 --> 00:49:37.000
Eun-gyeol.

00:49:38.459 --> 00:49:41.999
Do you really like Ji-seok?

00:49:42.999 --> 00:49:44.042
Huh?

00:49:50.709 --> 00:49:54.709
Our Ji-seok is going to be a pastor,

00:49:55.999 --> 00:49:58.417
and inherit this church.

00:50:14.167 --> 00:50:16.334
A pastor who once loved a man...

00:50:18.876 --> 00:50:22.500
Well, maybe by then,

00:50:22.542 --> 00:50:25.083
the world may become
more accepting.

00:50:26.876 --> 00:50:32.751
But our Lord will never understand.

00:50:39.999 --> 00:50:40.999
Eun-gyeol.

00:50:42.709 --> 00:50:45.584
Do you want Ji-seok to be happy?

00:50:46.999 --> 00:50:48.000
Huh?

00:50:48.042 --> 00:50:49.626
Do you really love him?

00:50:51.876 --> 00:50:52.999
Yes.

00:50:59.626 --> 00:51:00.999
Then disappear.

00:51:04.209 --> 00:51:08.918
Don't you think that's the love
Jesus taught us?

00:51:09.667 --> 00:51:14.999
Like how he died on the cross
to save all the sinners.

00:51:24.542 --> 00:51:25.584
Dear Ji-seok,

00:51:29.042 --> 00:51:31.209
I want the love I had for you

00:51:32.334 --> 00:51:33.999
to become friendship.

00:51:36.417 --> 00:51:38.626
And about the choice I had to make...

00:51:40.542 --> 00:51:42.834
I hope you don't
grieve me too much.

00:51:45.542 --> 00:51:46.918
Every decision I made...

00:51:49.292 --> 00:51:51.500
...was to make you happy.

00:51:53.999 --> 00:51:57.999
I actually thought
that when you see me,

00:52:00.292 --> 00:52:03.209
you'd at least look a little sorry.

00:52:06.459 --> 00:52:08.999
But the first thing
you said to me was...

00:52:12.999 --> 00:52:14.375
You filthy bastard.

00:52:18.334 --> 00:52:19.709
How could you say that?

00:52:19.751 --> 00:52:21.167
Filthy bastard.

00:52:21.209 --> 00:52:23.667
You're not even human.

00:52:23.709 --> 00:52:26.542
What?
You think I killed Eun-gyeol?

00:52:27.417 --> 00:52:31.375
No, you killed him.
Fucking psycho!

00:52:31.417 --> 00:52:34.999
If you hadn't fucked him,
he'd still be alive!

00:52:34.999 --> 00:52:37.000
You hear me, freak?

00:52:37.042 --> 00:52:38.334
Shut the hell up!

00:52:46.209 --> 00:52:47.834
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

00:52:47.876 --> 00:52:49.626
Put that down!
What are you doing, you psycho!

00:52:49.667 --> 00:52:52.959
Joo-an, that's enough.
Stop, okay? Just stop.

00:52:52.999 --> 00:52:55.167
Let go.
Let me go!

00:52:55.209 --> 00:52:57.292
What are you doing?
Untie me!

00:52:57.334 --> 00:52:59.375
Put that down, bastard!

00:53:00.209 --> 00:53:01.999
Ask and it shall be given to you.

00:53:03.834 --> 00:53:05.375
Seek and you shall find.

00:53:06.999 --> 00:53:08.751
A soul broken by sin...

00:53:11.584 --> 00:53:12.792
...shall be punished.

00:53:13.083 --> 00:53:14.209
Joo-an.

00:53:14.999 --> 00:53:15.999
Die.

00:53:15.999 --> 00:53:18.042
Ji-seok...
No, no, no!

00:53:18.584 --> 00:53:21.000
Ji-seok, money!
I'll give you money. All of it!

00:53:21.042 --> 00:53:23.999
Okay? I'll give you everything!
All the money...

00:53:23.999 --> 00:53:27.417
I'm sure you need money
to do whatever you're doing!

00:53:27.459 --> 00:53:29.584
Giving you money
is giving my everything.

00:53:29.876 --> 00:53:33.375
The safe...
The safe is right there.

00:53:33.417 --> 00:53:36.918
You need my fingerprint
to open that thing.

00:53:36.959 --> 00:53:40.999
I'll open it for you.
You hear me, bastard?

00:53:40.999 --> 00:53:43.042
So please spare my life.

00:53:43.083 --> 00:53:48.999
Please, spare me.
Please...

00:53:53.459 --> 00:53:54.792
Spare me, please...

00:54:09.167 --> 00:54:13.375
Use it for the children

00:54:39.626 --> 00:54:41.834
Well, look who it is.

00:54:42.876 --> 00:54:45.292
Took you long enough, fucker.

00:54:45.999 --> 00:54:47.459
Everything's gone.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.250
Why were you so late?

00:54:52.209 --> 00:54:53.500
What's that?

00:54:58.459 --> 00:55:00.459
Pastor, can you talk right now?

00:55:00.999 --> 00:55:01.999
Yes, Director.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.999
About that business you mentioned.

00:55:05.584 --> 00:55:07.792
I've been thinking...

00:55:07.834 --> 00:55:10.083
And I don't think
I can give it to you.

00:55:10.751 --> 00:55:11.751
What?

00:55:12.999 --> 00:55:15.417
What am I supposed to live off of?

00:55:15.459 --> 00:55:19.209
I can't just live off of my dreams.
I need to make money.

00:55:19.667 --> 00:55:21.292
You crazy bitch!

00:55:23.999 --> 00:55:25.334
So noisy.

00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:30.250
Try saying it to yourself first.

00:55:30.584 --> 00:55:32.999
Before we were a mom,

00:55:32.999 --> 00:55:35.417
we were women
that longed for love.

00:55:36.167 --> 00:55:37.751
Now, shall we say it together?

00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:40.083
I love myself.

00:55:40.375 --> 00:55:41.542
I love myself.

00:55:41.918 --> 00:55:43.000
I love myself.

00:55:43.042 --> 00:55:45.292
I truly love myself.

00:55:45.999 --> 00:55:47.250
I love myself.

00:55:47.584 --> 00:55:48.792
I love myself.

00:55:48.959 --> 00:55:50.000
I love you.

00:56:20.417 --> 00:56:22.999
Thank you to actors Yoo Seung-mok, Hwang Seok-jeong,
and Sung Hoon for their special appearance.

00:56:22.999 --> 00:56:25.999
The Defects

00:56:25.999 --> 00:56:28.999
Effective immediately,
this is now a classified serial murder case.

00:56:28.999 --> 00:56:29.999
Just kill them.

00:56:29.999 --> 00:56:31.667
Dead people can't be arrested.

00:56:31.709 --> 00:56:33.334
Today is the blessed day.

00:56:33.375 --> 00:56:34.999
I'll give you a reason to believe.

00:56:34.999 --> 00:56:36.792
Why is Sung-woo among them?

00:56:36.834 --> 00:56:39.626
He wants to find and kill his son.
We should help.

00:56:39.667 --> 00:56:41.751
You want me to go begging now?

00:56:41.792 --> 00:56:44.083
Keep running your mouth
and I'll bring Sung-woo back!

00:56:44.125 --> 00:56:46.459
But the ones who should be scared
now aren't us. It's them.

00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:47.999
But the ones who should be scared
now aren't us. It's them.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.709
He's in touch with
the Joseonjok gangsters.

00:56:50.751 --> 00:56:52.334
Can you kill him for me?
