(Liubo Island)

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:13.880
This island is really strange.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.560
There's no one

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.359
or a bird in sight.

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.640
There's something you don't know.

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:21.856
This is one of

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.519
the volcanic islands in the East Sea.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.879
Lava eruptions leave no vegetation alive.

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.199
Its Master Xue Qingyi
keeps a low profile.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.039
Few hear about him.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.359
You're pretty knowledgeable.

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:44.880
This place is quite peculiar.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.520
Stay alert.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:53.679
I feel someone's been following us.

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:56.799
From the moment we landed,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.320
we've been trailed.

00:02:47.268 --> 00:02:50.208
(Xue Qingyi, Master of Liubo Island)

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:07.080
Are you really

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.096
disciples of Huang Yaoshi,

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.599
the Eastern Evil from Taohua Island?

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.960
Mr. Xue.

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.080
We indeed come from Taohua Island.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.000
I have

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.159
long admired Mr. Huang.

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:25.319
Anyway, what brings

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.879
you all here?

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:29.879
We hear Liubo Island

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:31.919
abounds with exotic plants.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.000
We came for a Tinder Flower.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.159
You're quite well-informed.

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:43.735
The Tinder Flower only grows

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:44.759
on Liubo Island.

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:48.439
However,

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.879
since Mr. Huang wants it,

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.879
I shall present it.

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:57.800
We didn't come in vain.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.120
The juice of the Tinder Flower

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.400
is medicinal.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.056
The juice should be extracted

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.039
upon the flower blooms.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.135
The flower will bloom

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:13.520
in two or three days.

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:15.520
You may stay here temporarily

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.360
and await the blooming.

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:19.759
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.399
We'll trouble you then.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.879
Take these guests to rest.

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:27.519
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.279
The smell is overwhelming.

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:07.600
I've never seen them.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.240
It's kind of bleak.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.040
You guys must be tired from travelling.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.600
The food is ready.

00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:15.936
Thank you

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.439
for your warm hospitality.

00:05:26.084 --> 00:05:27.488
(Feng Mofeng)

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.480
Please enjoy your meal.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.040
Thank you.

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:41.720
He is so hospitable.

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.160
He prepared all this food for us.

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:44.519
Let's...

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:46.879
Chaofeng.

00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:47.977
What are you doing?

00:05:48.001 --> 00:05:49.199
Don't you find this strange?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.008
Why would he

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:52.839
give us the Tinder Flower freely?

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.976
Because he admires our Master,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000
the Eastern Evil,

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.399
and wants to befriend him.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.104
You believe whatever he says?

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.519
- That's true.
- Chaofeng.

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:01.928
It's just a flower.

00:06:01.952 --> 00:06:02.856
Moreover,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.279
no matter what it is,

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:05.920
our Master deserves to have it.

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:07.279
Mr. Xue

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.360
has remained secluded on Liubo Island.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.079
Few hear about him.

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:13.120
But he has no notorious reputation.

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:15.896
Chaofeng,

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.735
you needn't suspect everyone

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:19.160
of being evil.

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:21.279
This world

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.959
is full of hypocritical people.

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:24.439
You haven't encountered them

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.560
because you're lucky.

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:27.720
Once it happens, you'll be doomed.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Stop arguing.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.399
This place is strange.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.560
Stay cautious.

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:33.768
I've tested the food.

00:06:33.792 --> 00:06:34.615
It's not poisonous.

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:35.536
See?

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.560
I was right.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.360
Chaofeng.

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:43.120
Chengfeng, how could you speak
to her like that?

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:44.495
What I said wasn't wrong.

00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:45.360
The food was tested.

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:46.399
It's not poisonous.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.680
But some poisons can't

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:49.199
be detected by silver needles.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.839
We can't be too careful.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.920
Chaofeng's suspicion isn't unfounded.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.360
I'll go check.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.279
Why didn't you tell me before?

00:07:01.519 --> 00:07:02.560
You didn't ask.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.959
In such a short time,

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:26.336
your martial arts skills

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.519
have improved a lot.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.040
Why are you here?

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.720
Don't you talk
about my malicious speculation

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.399
with them?

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.600
I agree with your guess.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.839
I don't think Xue Qingyi is a good man.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.240
To gain something,

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.600
you must first give.

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:45.439
If he truly admired our Master,

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.360
why hasn't he visited Taohua Island?

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:48.936
Exactly!

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.240
When dealing with hypocrites,

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.560
we can't be too careful.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.319
Sometimes, naive kindness

00:07:53.519 --> 00:07:54.639
could kill us.

00:07:58.519 --> 00:08:00.175
They grew up

00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:01.519
on isolated Taohua Island.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.040
They remain simple,

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:05.360
while you and I have experienced a lot.

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:09.639
You haven't

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:10.920
eaten anything yet.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:13.920
I'm not hungry.

00:08:16.439 --> 00:08:19.279
Take this as Chengfeng's apology.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.175
Don't be angry anymore.

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:22.272
I'm leaving.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.120
Slow down.

00:08:57.759 --> 00:08:59.279
Slow down, and don't choke.

00:09:01.879 --> 00:09:03.000
So annoying!

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.679
So, are we eating or not?

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.096
Take a gamble!

00:09:22.279 --> 00:09:23.919
Perhaps we should take antidotes

00:09:24.159 --> 00:09:25.919
before we eat.

00:09:26.639 --> 00:09:27.840
It would ensure safety.

00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:30.120
Lingfeng, take it.

00:09:30.159 --> 00:09:31.240
Are you crazy?

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:32.216
Who takes antidotes

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.240
before eating poison?

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:35.977
In my opinion,

00:09:36.001 --> 00:09:37.799
let's eat without suspicion.

00:09:38.039 --> 00:09:39.696
If they think

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.720
we distrust them,

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.919
it'll jeopardize our mission.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.895
If we eat

00:09:43.919 --> 00:09:44.775
and get poisoned...

00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:45.799
Stop arguing!

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.080
We'll eat in turn.

00:09:51.039 --> 00:09:52.279
If anything happens,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
someone can assist.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.240
Good idea!

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.440
- Me first!
- Me first!

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.200
Fine! You first!

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.440
Let's eat then. No fear!

00:10:01.399 --> 00:10:02.399
Go ahead.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.256
Sure.

00:10:04.519 --> 00:10:05.536
I'll eat too.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.320
Why are you staring at me?

00:10:29.559 --> 00:10:30.559
Want to escape?

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.080
How dare you!

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.759
You're doomed.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.960
Where can you run to?

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.039
You'll be Master's slave forever.

00:10:38.519 --> 00:10:39.519
Who's there?

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.200
Two adults bully a child?

00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:45.399
Shame on you!

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.039
Thank you so much.

00:10:56.759 --> 00:10:57.760
Who are you?

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.120
I'm Feng Mofeng.

00:10:59.639 --> 00:11:00.639
Where's your family?

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.120
My entire family

00:11:05.559 --> 00:11:07.399
was enslaved by the Xue Qingyi.

00:11:08.679 --> 00:11:09.679
Later,

00:11:11.159 --> 00:11:13.399
they all died horribly as drug testers.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.639
My escape attempts all failed.

00:11:17.679 --> 00:11:19.679
Your companions

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.799
have been taken as drug testers.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.320
Go save them quickly!

00:11:51.879 --> 00:11:52.879
Mianfeng.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Chengfeng.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.840
Xue Qingyi!

00:12:02.039 --> 00:12:03.039
Let us out!

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.360
Welcome to my place.

00:12:05.879 --> 00:12:06.879
Chaofeng was right.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.360
You're no good person.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.416
There was clearly no poison

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.440
in the food.

00:12:11.919 --> 00:12:13.720
How did you manage it then?

00:12:14.679 --> 00:12:16.559
My Master is known
as the Unorthodox Herbalist.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.120
He poisons without a trace.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.320
Poisoning food

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.440
is beneath his methods.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.320
It disgusts him.

00:12:23.039 --> 00:12:24.039
Exactly!

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.320
The real poison source

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.399
is the Evil Flower.

00:12:28.799 --> 00:12:30.159
The meal itself is good.

00:12:30.559 --> 00:12:32.696
When combined
with the flower's fragrance,

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.616
(Ancient Herb)

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.399
It becomes the most potent drug.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.440
That's a cheap shot.

00:12:37.919 --> 00:12:39.639
You are so despicable.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.039
My title as Unorthodox Herbalist

00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:44.240
isn't earned through healing the sick.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.399
If you want something,

00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:48.559
you must pay the price.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.600
What do you want?

00:12:53.159 --> 00:12:56.159
The greatest poison
lies in mental manipulation.

00:12:56.879 --> 00:12:58.559
I'm developing the Emotions Powder.

00:12:58.759 --> 00:12:59.879
Anyone poisoned by this,

00:13:00.639 --> 00:13:02.559
even the greatest martial masters,

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.519
will fall under my mental control.

00:13:08.799 --> 00:13:11.120
This formula
contains 49 toxic ingredients.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.360
These seven poisonous herbs
are just the first layer.

00:13:14.759 --> 00:13:16.600
Ordinary people can't even withstand it.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.296
Only powerful martial artists

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.320
can endure it.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.039
Only they qualify to be my drug testers.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.679
The three of them

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.600
are imprisoned in the poison lab
for experimentation.

00:13:34.919 --> 00:13:35.936
Mofeng,

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.320
we have to rescue them.

00:13:37.759 --> 00:13:38.840
How do we enter that lab?

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000
The poison lab

00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:41.559
is heavily guarded.

00:13:41.639 --> 00:13:43.399
It's filled with poison traps inside.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.919
To prevent outsiders,

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.120
apart from Xue Qingyi,

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.919
Qinghong and Qingpeng,

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.320
no one can enter freely.

00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:51.240
Qinghong and Qingpeng aren't threats.

00:13:52.519 --> 00:13:54.519
If we lure Xue Qingyi away
from the poison lab,

00:13:54.799 --> 00:13:56.039
we'll be able to save them.

00:13:57.519 --> 00:13:58.495
How do we lure Xue Qingyi

00:13:58.519 --> 00:13:59.519
away from the poison lab?

00:14:00.519 --> 00:14:01.519
If I want to fight,

00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:03.840
enemies in defensible places

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.360
will have to take it

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.840
when I attack their vital points.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.799
We'll strike where he must defend.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.296
I thought you were merely

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.639
ordinary martial artists,

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.159
but I didn't expect

00:14:15.559 --> 00:14:16.775
your martial arts

00:14:16.799 --> 00:14:17.799
to be so unique.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.135
This makes you

00:14:19.159 --> 00:14:20.159
perfect drug testers.

00:14:21.639 --> 00:14:22.616
How dare you commit

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:23.840
such heinous acts!

00:14:24.039 --> 00:14:26.039
You're unworthy to be a healer!

00:14:30.688 --> 00:14:31.536
What are you doing?

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:32.864
- What are you doing?
- Lingfeng.

00:14:33.159 --> 00:14:35.120
Lingfeng! What are you doing?

00:14:35.559 --> 00:14:36.559
What do you want?

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.320
I haven't felt fear in a long time.

00:14:46.679 --> 00:14:47.679
Besides the poison lab,

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.720
what else does Xue Qingyi value?

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.360
Apart from the poison lab,

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.624
he values the alchemy chamber.

00:14:55.008 --> 00:14:55.937
That's where he keeps

00:14:55.961 --> 00:14:57.559
his most precious herbs and formulas.

00:14:57.759 --> 00:14:58.879
But the alchemy chamber

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.120
is like an iron rampart.

00:15:00.279 --> 00:15:01.960
Not even a fly can enter.

00:15:03.679 --> 00:15:04.679
Alchemy?

00:15:05.124 --> 00:15:07.328
(Ancient Herb)

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.240
One day,

00:15:09.632 --> 00:15:11.015
I'll create the most potent poison

00:15:11.039 --> 00:15:12.360
in the entire world.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.559
I'll make the entire martial world

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.120
submit to me.

00:15:29.632 --> 00:15:30.840
- Found them?
- No.

00:15:51.872 --> 00:15:52.960
Take him to our Master.

00:15:53.159 --> 00:15:54.176
Yes.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.759
Master, the alchemy chamber is
in trouble!

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.682
The furnace must have exploded.

00:16:08.799 --> 00:16:10.159
Master, I've caught a guy.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.440
The other won't escape.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.096
Take him in first. Guard this place.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:13.977
Yes.

00:16:14.001 --> 00:16:16.240
- You guys, come fight the fire!
- Yes!

00:16:16.279 --> 00:16:17.840
- You two stay here.
- Yes.

00:16:17.919 --> 00:16:18.919
Come on.

00:16:25.559 --> 00:16:26.559
Get inside.

00:16:35.159 --> 00:16:36.240
My Master's poison lab

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.360
is the most secure place in the world.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.919
You want to rescue people?

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.879
That's pure delusion.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.120
So what if you saw it?

00:16:49.799 --> 00:16:51.159
Do you think you'll leave alive?

00:16:53.919 --> 00:16:54.919
Go!

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.656
Are you okay?

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:26.920
Your invention actually worked.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:28.256
Without getting close,

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.504
I blew up the alchemy chamber.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.160
It's simple.

00:17:31.359 --> 00:17:32.599
The sulfur and saltpeter

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.759
were mixed with charcoal.

00:17:34.079 --> 00:17:35.400
Let's go save them now!

00:17:38.759 --> 00:17:40.119
Lingfeng, are you there?

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.599
- Can you hear me?
- Chengfeng, Mianfeng.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:43.920
Lingfeng.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.984
Chengfeng, Mianfeng.

00:17:49.519 --> 00:17:50.519
Lingfeng.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.680
Chengfeng, Mianfeng.

00:17:53.216 --> 00:17:54.136
Chengfeng.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.056
Save them!

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.519
Chengfeng.

00:17:57.359 --> 00:17:58.255
Mianfeng.

00:17:58.279 --> 00:17:59.136
Wake up!

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.160
Mianfeng.

00:18:01.119 --> 00:18:02.815
Lingfeng.

00:18:02.839 --> 00:18:03.960
Mianfeng. Wake up!

00:18:04.192 --> 00:18:05.161
- Mianfeng.
- Lingfeng.

00:18:05.185 --> 00:18:06.240
- Mianfeng.
- Lingfeng.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:07.880
Chaofeng.

00:18:08.599 --> 00:18:09.599
Xuanfeng.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.160
They'll return soon.

00:18:19.839 --> 00:18:21.039
We need to leave quickly.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.160
Come back to rescue them later.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.920
Alright.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.000
Take those drugs with us

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.472
in case they harm people.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.680
Let's go.

00:18:31.079 --> 00:18:32.128
Go!

00:18:50.079 --> 00:18:51.616
Thankfully, you two arrived in time.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.656
Otherwise,

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.696
we would've...

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.672
Chaofeng.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.240
I'm sorry.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.519
I made a mistake.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.160
I trusted

00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:05.559
that hypocritical man,

00:19:06.119 --> 00:19:07.960
endangering Lingfeng and Mianfeng.

00:19:12.799 --> 00:19:13.880
In the end,

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.960
you put aside past grudges.

00:19:16.559 --> 00:19:17.759
We're doing what we should.

00:19:18.599 --> 00:19:20.079
Fellow disciples are like siblings.

00:19:21.039 --> 00:19:22.440
Supporting each other is our duty.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:23.880
No need to thank us.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.680
His poison techniques are formidable.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.160
What should we do?

00:19:30.039 --> 00:19:31.359
We can't return empty-handed.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.119
Let's eliminate the scum together,

00:19:34.519 --> 00:19:35.519
get the Tinder Flower,

00:19:36.079 --> 00:19:37.079
and return.

00:19:37.799 --> 00:19:38.799
Among them,

00:19:40.039 --> 00:19:41.359
only Xue Qingyi uses poison

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.279
in unpredictable ways.

00:19:44.799 --> 00:19:46.039
If we can subdue Xue Qingyi,

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.000
success will be ours.

00:19:49.559 --> 00:19:50.559
Xuanfeng.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.680
Can you

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.200
modify the explosives for close combat?

00:19:56.119 --> 00:19:57.119
Well...

00:19:58.039 --> 00:19:59.519
Perhaps Chengfeng can do it.

00:20:10.464 --> 00:20:11.376
Master.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.217
Found them?

00:20:12.241 --> 00:20:13.640
They are quite cunning.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.015
We've searched the island,

00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:16.279
but we found no trace of them.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.240
No boats are missing.

00:20:17.359 --> 00:20:18.359
They haven't left.

00:20:19.079 --> 00:20:20.079
Search everywhere

00:20:20.359 --> 00:20:21.559
to find them!

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:49.880
Attack!

00:21:58.319 --> 00:21:59.319
Kill them.

00:22:17.759 --> 00:22:18.759
What did you do to them?

00:22:19.799 --> 00:22:21.000
I tested

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.960
my newly developed poison on them.

00:22:23.359 --> 00:22:25.079
Now, their combat power is enhanced.

00:22:25.119 --> 00:22:26.119
They're obedient

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.240
and fearless of death.

00:22:27.359 --> 00:22:29.000
They're perfect killing machines.

00:22:29.279 --> 00:22:30.680
They are your disciples.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.240
They should be proud

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.279
of being my drug testers.

00:22:35.519 --> 00:22:36.759
You're insane!

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.575
For this alone,

00:22:38.599 --> 00:22:39.720
you deserve death.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.240
Show me what you've got.

00:23:14.752 --> 00:23:15.697
A whistle signal!

00:23:15.721 --> 00:23:16.801
Their minds are controlled.

00:23:17.359 --> 00:23:18.368
Mianfeng, sleeve arrows!

00:23:32.519 --> 00:23:33.536
Xue Qingyi escaped.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.480
Thankfully, we're safe.

00:23:41.279 --> 00:23:42.279
We are

00:23:43.519 --> 00:23:45.039
finally free.

00:23:45.799 --> 00:23:49.160
We'll never be separated.

00:23:58.599 --> 00:23:59.920
We must pursue Xue Qingyi.

00:24:00.279 --> 00:24:01.472
The Tinder Flower's blooming.

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.200
We need to obtain it swiftly.

00:24:12.119 --> 00:24:13.799
Is this the Tinder Flower?

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.216
Chaofeng, let me do it.

00:24:23.599 --> 00:24:24.599
Be careful!

00:24:31.839 --> 00:24:33.400
According to my intelligence,

00:24:34.119 --> 00:24:35.359
Mount Hua

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.799
honors Huang Yaoshi
as one of the Five Greats.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.720
After seeing you all,

00:24:40.039 --> 00:24:41.839
I think Huang Yaoshi is not that powerful.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.519
We play fair

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.656
to get what we have.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.536
A sneaky man like you

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.240
who uses poison has no right to judge.

00:24:48.039 --> 00:24:49.599
You came

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.880
for the Tinder Flower.

00:24:52.279 --> 00:24:54.599
Stop pretending to be righteous.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.032
That's the Tinder Flower.

00:24:56.359 --> 00:24:57.960
Come and take it yourselves.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.680
This door and lock were crafted

00:25:05.759 --> 00:25:07.240
with iron by Feng Asan.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:08.880
I have the key.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.400
Apart from me,

00:25:10.839 --> 00:25:12.799
Feng Asan was the other one
who could open it.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.599
Yet he's already dead.

00:25:15.759 --> 00:25:17.640
You'll never get in.

00:25:18.039 --> 00:25:20.000
We can't go in, and you can't get out.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:21.960
Let's see who will win.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.599
The Tinder Flower is blooming.

00:25:45.664 --> 00:25:46.617
This flower

00:25:46.641 --> 00:25:48.200
blossoms once every 19 years.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.000
That's because on my island,

00:25:51.519 --> 00:25:52.696
the magma below only surges

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.880
once every 19 years.

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.839
Only the intense heat

00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.799
of this magma

00:26:00.519 --> 00:26:02.200
can make the Tinder Flower bloom.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.359
The underground magma

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:13.960
is about to erupt.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.440
You all

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.575
either give up the Tinder Flower

00:26:18.599 --> 00:26:19.599
and leave immediately

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.255
or stay here and await death!

00:26:22.279 --> 00:26:23.168
Xue Qingyi!

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.320
Open this door if you dare!

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.119
Only the area behind this door is safe.

00:26:30.759 --> 00:26:31.920
I can open up this lock.

00:26:35.559 --> 00:26:37.079
How do you have a key?

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.880
My grandfather gave it to me.

00:26:39.119 --> 00:26:40.480
My grandfather was Feng Asan.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.440
He anticipated you'd silence him,

00:26:45.759 --> 00:26:47.359
so he secretly made a duplicate for me.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.559
The Tinder Flower is mine!

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:57.960
It's...

00:27:04.039 --> 00:27:05.039
Come here!

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.480
Oh no! The volcano's erupting!

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.440
Reborn through fire.

00:27:23.359 --> 00:27:24.400
This is the Tinder Flower.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.576
Give it to me!

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:26.624
Here you go.

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.920
Grandfather.

00:27:40.759 --> 00:27:41.759
Mother, Father.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.039
I've avenged your death.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:52.480
Hurry up!

00:27:52.599 --> 00:27:53.599
Master's wife can't wait.

00:27:53.984 --> 00:27:55.000
- Done. Let's go!
- Go!

00:27:55.072 --> 00:27:56.440
- Quick!
- Go!

00:28:20.119 --> 00:28:21.119
Whose idea was this?

00:28:24.759 --> 00:28:25.824
Mine.

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.000
Master.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.400
I'm to blame.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:34.920
It was my idea.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.616
Master.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.640
I led them.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.624
I forced them to go.

00:28:39.648 --> 00:28:41.039
Punish me, please.

00:28:41.079 --> 00:28:41.977
Master.

00:28:42.001 --> 00:28:43.400
As the first disciple, punish me.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.176
Master, I forced them
to accompany me to Liubo Island.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.296
It's all...

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.640
It's all my fault.

00:28:51.119 --> 00:28:52.119
Master,

00:28:52.319 --> 00:28:53.559
the root cause lies with me.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.200
I secretly read your letter.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.039
You all stop arguing.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:18.960
Master,

00:29:19.119 --> 00:29:20.720
we were anxious to save Master's wife.

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.575
After Mianfeng learned from the letter

00:29:23.599 --> 00:29:24.759
about the Tinder Flower,

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.319
we all felt

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.480
that no matter what,

00:29:27.559 --> 00:29:29.720
we should get the flower for her.

00:29:34.359 --> 00:29:35.359
Master,

00:29:36.119 --> 00:29:37.119
I admit.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.039
I had selfish motives.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.440
I thought if I could get this flower,

00:29:42.799 --> 00:29:43.799
perhaps you

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.279
would personally teach me.

00:29:54.279 --> 00:29:55.279
Madam.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.240
I made a mistake.

00:30:04.759 --> 00:30:05.759
Please punish me.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.240
Master,

00:30:07.319 --> 00:30:08.319
we were in danger

00:30:08.359 --> 00:30:09.359
and nearly died.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.519
Chaofeng saved us.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:11.839
Without her warning,

00:30:11.904 --> 00:30:13.495
we'd have fallen into Xue Qingyi's trap.

00:30:13.519 --> 00:30:14.519
That's true, Master.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.448
If Chaofeng hadn't been alert,

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.400
we'd have become drug testers

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.544
and died.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:21.880
Master.

00:30:22.119 --> 00:30:23.279
Although Chaofeng is a woman,

00:30:23.799 --> 00:30:24.799
her courage

00:30:24.839 --> 00:30:25.856
impresses us.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:26.896
That's true, Master.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:27.960
Chaofeng is amazing.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.680
How did you suspect Xue Qingyi?

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.359
You're much better than Xuanfeng.

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.400
Wu Mianfeng.

00:30:41.759 --> 00:30:43.720
Are you holding a victory celebration?

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:46.680
Master.

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:52.640
Who are you?

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.055
I...

00:30:56.079 --> 00:30:58.000
Master, he is Feng Mofeng.

00:30:58.319 --> 00:30:59.880
Thanks to him,

00:31:00.319 --> 00:31:01.440
we came back alive.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:10.640
My name is Feng Mofeng.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.519
Sir, please accept me as your disciple.

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.240
Call him Master.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.856
Master, please take me as your disciple.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:23.880
Master.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.400
Master.

00:31:27.279 --> 00:31:29.000
Master, Madam has recovered.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.880
What did you say your name was?

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.000
Feng Mofeng.

00:31:49.599 --> 00:31:50.599
That's good.

00:31:51.759 --> 00:31:52.880
No need to change your name.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.400
Why still kneeling? All rise.

00:32:00.608 --> 00:32:01.576
What does this mean?

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.200
He just left us like this?

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.240
Has Master forgiven us?

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.680
Master said
he didn't need to change his name.

00:32:09.319 --> 00:32:10.319
So?

00:32:11.039 --> 00:32:11.856
Mofeng's accepted.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:12.696
Accepted?

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.720
Accepted.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:15.279
Should we keep kneeling?

00:32:15.519 --> 00:32:16.839
Rise. It's settled.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:18.640
I'm a senior now!

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.176
- I have a junior now!
- Me too!

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.216
- Mofeng.
- Mofeng.

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.464
Mofeng.

00:32:23.519 --> 00:32:24.696
You're Master's disciple now.

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.024
You're now my junior.

00:32:26.048 --> 00:32:26.976
Really?

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000
- I have a junior!
- Yes.

00:32:28.039 --> 00:32:29.176
I'm now his disciple?

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.200
I have a junior brother!

00:32:30.359 --> 00:32:31.216
He.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.240
Accepted me!

00:32:32.279 --> 00:32:33.279
I have a master now!

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.576
Chaofeng.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.200
Thank you.

00:32:55.599 --> 00:32:56.417
The Tinder Flower

00:32:56.441 --> 00:32:57.880
has greatly improved my condition.

00:32:59.039 --> 00:33:00.039
Tell me

00:33:00.319 --> 00:33:01.359
what you experienced

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.519
on Liubo Island.

00:33:04.039 --> 00:33:05.039
Nothing, Madam.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.119
I never imagined

00:33:16.279 --> 00:33:17.279
that I could

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:19.799
quietly

00:33:20.119 --> 00:33:21.160
take a hot bath

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.519
like this.

00:33:28.079 --> 00:33:29.160
Meeting you all

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.200
must be a blessing from my past life.

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.960
To repay your kindness,

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.599
even partially,

00:33:37.279 --> 00:33:38.319
I, Mei Ruohua,

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.000
will do my best.

00:33:42.599 --> 00:33:43.599
Mei Chaofeng.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:45.920
Mei Chaofeng.

00:33:49.359 --> 00:33:50.359
Chaofeng.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:53.799
Let the past

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:55.839
remain in the past.

00:33:57.279 --> 00:33:58.440
All previous suffering

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.200
has gone.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.440
Here,

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.839
you may allow yourself vulnerability.

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.119
Wherever you go in the future,

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:09.239
remember

00:34:10.599 --> 00:34:14.239
that the past is false.

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:16.239
There's no end

00:34:17.519 --> 00:34:19.440
to memories.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.760
I know

00:34:27.119 --> 00:34:28.760
your former home is gone.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.559
But from now on,

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:34.719
Taohua Island

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:36.840
will be your home.

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:41.239
We.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.760
Will be your family.

00:34:53.079 --> 00:34:54.719
(This attire really suits you.)

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.440
(You're pretty.)

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.679
(Dressed like this, you glow brighter.)

00:34:59.559 --> 00:35:00.559
(Young ladies)

00:35:00.599 --> 00:35:02.079
(shouldn't always fight and kill.)

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.456
(Relax properly)

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:04.400
(and dress up.)

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.840
(Make yourselves radiant.)

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.679
(It makes your life much more fun.)

00:35:10.559 --> 00:35:11.559
Come on. Cheers.

00:35:11.599 --> 00:35:12.416
- Come on.
- Come on.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.288
Bottoms up!

00:35:13.312 --> 00:35:14.312
Chaofeng is here.

00:35:14.848 --> 00:35:16.192
- Chaofeng.
- Come quick!

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.615
Come on. Have a seat!

00:35:17.639 --> 00:35:18.752
Come on.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Chaofeng.

00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:22.599
You should smile more often.

00:35:22.679 --> 00:35:23.679
It makes you look lovely.

00:35:24.679 --> 00:35:26.135
Xuanfeng, that's my seat.

00:35:26.159 --> 00:35:27.199
- Sit.
- Chaofeng.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.695
We owe our success to you.

00:35:29.719 --> 00:35:30.856
Without you,

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:31.896
we might've been dead.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:33.599
If any of them ever offended you before,

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.039
I'll apologize on their behalf.

00:35:35.199 --> 00:35:36.296
What are you talking about?

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.416
We would apologize ourselves

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.495
if we made any mistake.

00:35:38.519 --> 00:35:39.519
We don't need you.

00:35:40.039 --> 00:35:41.039
Exactly! Come on!

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.400
To celebrate our adventure

00:35:43.519 --> 00:35:44.400
and narrow escape!

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:45.559
And Master's wife finally

00:35:45.599 --> 00:35:46.639
got the Tinder Flower.

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:47.760
Most importantly,

00:35:48.039 --> 00:35:49.039
she's recovered.

00:35:49.199 --> 00:35:50.016
What's more,

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.360
we have a new junior brother!

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.776
We also owe thanks to Mofeng.

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.920
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:35:54.079 --> 00:35:55.360
- Let's drink!
- Cheers!

00:35:56.199 --> 00:35:57.440
Kids shouldn't drink alcohol.

00:35:58.599 --> 00:35:59.495
Don't worry.

00:35:59.519 --> 00:36:00.416
I can drink.

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:01.297
You can't.

00:36:01.321 --> 00:36:02.688
- Just one sip! Please!
- No way.

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.280
Getting the Tinder Flower wasn't

00:36:06.559 --> 00:36:07.960
just my achievement alone.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.719
Xuanfeng helped greatly.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.199
Lingfeng and Chengfeng

00:36:12.559 --> 00:36:13.559
also helped.

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:16.400
This mission

00:36:16.719 --> 00:36:18.480
couldn't have succeeded
without you guys.

00:36:19.199 --> 00:36:20.199
Of course,

00:36:20.519 --> 00:36:21.519
Mofeng helped too.

00:36:21.639 --> 00:36:22.639
It's my pleasure.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.480
Speaking of which,

00:36:24.519 --> 00:36:25.736
raise your cup too, Mofeng.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.776
Right!

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:27.800
Chen Xuanfeng.

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:29.575
What's wrong with men drinking?

00:36:29.599 --> 00:36:30.880
- Cheers!
- Alright, cheers!

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:31.920
Chen Xuanfeng.

00:36:33.199 --> 00:36:34.199
He has water.

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.599
- That's not important.
- Let's drink!

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.440
You guys,

00:36:38.519 --> 00:36:39.760
I'm so glad to meet you all.

00:36:40.119 --> 00:36:41.760
Drink at your pace. I'm finishing mine.

00:36:42.239 --> 00:36:43.239
At our pace?

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:44.800
Yaoshi,

00:36:45.679 --> 00:36:47.760
look how happy they have been

00:36:48.239 --> 00:36:50.000
since Chaofeng came to the island.

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.239
Lingfeng never drinks casually.

00:36:52.559 --> 00:36:53.575
Normally, he drinks

00:36:53.599 --> 00:36:55.976
- out of jars!
- Exactly!

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000
- Xuanfeng.
- Good.

00:36:57.024 --> 00:36:58.215
You drink with Lingfeng.

00:36:58.239 --> 00:36:59.175
Let's drink out of jars.

00:36:59.199 --> 00:37:00.096
We won't drink.

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.416
How about you two drink together?

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.257
Let's drink!

00:37:02.281 --> 00:37:03.639
I just want you to be happy.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.432
That's all I want.

00:37:08.032 --> 00:37:09.088
Exactly!

00:37:09.892 --> 00:37:10.788
- Come on.
- Cheers!

00:37:10.852 --> 00:37:12.044
Drink up!

00:37:12.068 --> 00:37:13.544
Let's drink!

00:37:13.568 --> 00:37:15.175
Lingfeng, I'll drink with you.

00:37:15.199 --> 00:37:16.760
I truly love days like this.

00:37:17.156 --> 00:37:18.336
Come on, drink!

00:37:18.719 --> 00:37:20.280
Don't blame the kids too much.

00:37:21.519 --> 00:37:22.416
Mofeng, come on.

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:23.337
Raise your cup! Drink!

00:37:23.361 --> 00:37:24.495
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:37:24.519 --> 00:37:26.015
- Let's drink!
- Cheers!

00:37:26.039 --> 00:37:27.039
I don't blame them.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.320
They did it all for you.

00:37:39.639 --> 00:37:40.616
Mofeng.

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.000
Taohua Island is your home.

00:37:42.624 --> 00:37:43.615
If anything happens,

00:37:43.639 --> 00:37:44.719
come find me or Lingfeng.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:45.824
I'm also here for you.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.440
You're a big kid now.

00:38:03.079 --> 00:38:04.599
Learn to take care of yourself.

00:38:05.199 --> 00:38:06.920
Don't worry.

00:38:07.199 --> 00:38:08.400
I'm tough.

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.320
I won't kick off my quilt.

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.320
Good.

00:38:13.679 --> 00:38:14.720
Go to sleep now.

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.000
Let her go!

00:39:15.639 --> 00:39:16.575
What's wrong?

00:39:16.599 --> 00:39:17.599
What happened?

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:23.960
Aren't you a tough kid?

00:39:25.079 --> 00:39:26.320
You're already a big kid.

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.119
Why are you crying?

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.440
I'm not crying.

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.400
I'm leaving.

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:41.920
Chaofeng.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.559
Can you sing a song for me?

00:39:45.079 --> 00:39:46.639
When there was thunder before,

00:39:47.119 --> 00:39:48.920
my sister always sang to me.

00:39:49.679 --> 00:39:50.920
That's how I could fall asleep.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.519
Your sister could sing.

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:54.920
But I can't.

Don't wake Mofeng up.

00:41:19.719 --> 00:41:21.079
What are you doing here so late?

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.320
To check on Mofeng.

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:31.800
Are you worried
I can't take care of Mofeng?

00:41:33.639 --> 00:41:35.119
I did think that way before.

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:36.480
But now,

00:41:37.119 --> 00:41:38.920
I realize how terribly wrong I was.

00:41:42.079 --> 00:41:43.200
Chaofeng.

00:41:43.519 --> 00:41:46.039
You're even better than I imagined.

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.000
I have to go. Good night.
