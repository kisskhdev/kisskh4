-Hmm.
-[chains rattling]

00:45.795 --> 00:46.796
I've read your book.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.549
Unlocking the Outcast Mind.

00:50.258 --> 00:53.428
It came in very handy
when I was grooming Tyler. [chuckles]

00:53.928 --> 00:57.265
You'll forgive me if I don't use that
as a pull quote in the next edition.

00:57.932 --> 01:01.352
I thought keeping you two apart would
diminish your emotional hold over him.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.023
But it hasn't, has it?

01:05.648 --> 01:08.902
And now you want me to tell you
how to unlock my little monster.

01:08.985 --> 01:12.489
I want to know what you did to Tyler,
so that I can rehabilitate him.

01:12.572 --> 01:13.656
Rehabilitate?

01:14.324 --> 01:16.159
Is that what you do here? [scoffs]

01:16.242 --> 01:19.954
I had always heard whispers
that Willow Hill performed

01:20.038 --> 01:22.624
secret experiments on the Outcasts.

01:22.707 --> 01:25.710
We also do
alien autopsies in the basement.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.171
Now, are you willing to help me or not?

01:28.254 --> 01:31.174
Only if you'll agree to have me
transferred here permanently,

01:31.257 --> 01:33.635
as a patient, and not a prisoner.

01:33.718 --> 01:36.221
That will be for a jury to decide.

01:37.013 --> 01:39.265
I'm sorry we couldn't make this work.

01:39.766 --> 01:43.978
I'll have to find
a more invasive method to unlock Tyler.

01:45.271 --> 01:48.108
Arrange her transfer
back to Northern State Correctional.

01:48.191 --> 01:50.610
And please note
that I recommend the prisoner be placed

01:50.693 --> 01:52.946

Easy… Easy, sweetie.

03:28.958 --> 03:30.335

you'd be working weekends.

so neither do I.

05:40.798 --> 05:44.344
Why are you interested
in this Patricia Redcar?

05:44.427 --> 05:46.387
She's part of my ongoing investigation.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.641
Look. I found all of these obituaries.

05:50.725 --> 05:53.728
All Outcasts, all patients at Willow Hill.

05:53.811 --> 05:55.688
They're all cremated and buried here.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.982
What does this have to do with you?

05:58.483 --> 06:01.778
I saw a vision of my roommate's death.
Somehow it's all connected.

06:01.861 --> 06:03.571
Please give her my card.

06:03.654 --> 06:07.784
I offer a friends and family discount

06:08.826 --> 06:12.080
If I had my psychic ability back,
I would have solved this already.

No crying over spilled ashes.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.962
You know what I say about feelings.

and allow them to slowly eat away at you.

Ah.

Shoddy work, I must say. Lumpy.

Hmm. That's odd.

into a murderous trap?

07:32.285 --> 07:33.578
Varicose and I had wagers.

07:33.661 --> 07:36.831
The Avian that controls them
just stole all my evidence.

07:36.914 --> 07:38.583
I've rattled their birdcage.

07:38.666 --> 07:40.710
The plot thickens. What's next?

07:40.793 --> 07:43.963
Buy this cemetery and find out
who authorized those cremations.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.757
Why would I do something so rash?

07:46.841 --> 07:50.470
Once you tell my mother you're finally
getting me into the family business,

07:50.553 --> 07:53.473

will come bubbling to the surface.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.142
Well played, my dear.

your way into my cold, desiccated heart.

08:22.543 --> 08:23.628
Who is Lois?

08:25.004 --> 08:27.965
And how was all of this connected
to Enid's impending death?

08:30.927 --> 08:32.678
The sooner I get answers,

08:32.762 --> 08:34.388
the sooner I can save Enid…

than make a compromise.

There's nothing mad about what I'm doing.

45:36.984 --> 45:38.318
Fairburn works for me.

45:38.402 --> 45:41.405
I recruited her to be
the public face of this institution

45:41.488 --> 45:43.031
and continue my father's work.

45:44.324 --> 45:46.076
You're Augustus Stonehurst's daughter.

45:47.077 --> 45:49.621
That's how you knew about
the secret passages at Nevermore.

45:49.705 --> 45:52.249
You must've used them
to visit your aviary in Iago Tower.

45:52.332 --> 45:55.419
I have very fond memories
of my father's time at Nevermore.

45:55.502 --> 45:56.670
He loved Outcasts.

45:57.254 --> 45:58.547
Evidence to the contrary.

45:58.630 --> 45:59.715
He wanted to be one.

46:00.299 --> 46:04.011
Imagine being able to extract
their abilities and share it with Normies.

46:04.094 --> 46:06.388
You mean steal them and exploit them.

46:07.264 --> 46:09.558
This is a basement bargain
attempt at Dr. Moreau.

46:10.142 --> 46:12.644
I did more than just attempt. [laughs]

46:12.728 --> 46:14.229
I am living proof.

46:14.313 --> 46:15.647
I was born a Normie,

46:15.731 --> 46:18.192
and thanks to my father's work,

46:18.275 --> 46:22.196
my beautiful black-winged friends
obey my every whim.

46:22.863 --> 46:25.199
Experimenting on his own daughter.

46:25.282 --> 46:26.408
That's twisted.

46:26.492 --> 46:28.327
Even by my own sick standards.

46:28.410 --> 46:30.329
[tuts] I volunteered!

46:30.412 --> 46:32.206
My father and I were a team.

46:32.289 --> 46:33.916
He needed a subject.

46:33.999 --> 46:35.918
I wanted to be part of his legacy.

46:36.001 --> 46:37.419
[Wednesday] Until he lost his mind?

46:37.503 --> 46:40.714
[Judi] He wanted to be a DaVinci,
but his body couldn't take it.

46:41.340 --> 46:45.302
Well, if you can't bring Icarus
to the sun, bring the sun to Icarus.

46:45.385 --> 46:46.678
Right, Fester?

46:46.762 --> 46:48.889
[dramatic music builds]

46:57.189 --> 46:58.941
What the hell happened?

46:59.024 --> 47:00.275
Wednesday happened.

47:00.359 --> 47:02.194
We need to call in Sheriff Santiago.

47:03.028 --> 47:05.072
[klaxon blares]

47:05.781 --> 47:07.157
[prisoners laughing]

47:09.993 --> 47:11.203
[Judi gasps]

47:11.912 --> 47:13.580
Oh!

47:15.082 --> 47:18.252
Get off of me! Stop it! Get off!

47:18.335 --> 47:22.172
As much as I wanna watch them
pluck her feathers, we gotta vamoose.

47:23.841 --> 47:25.384
Get off of me!

47:26.134 --> 47:27.219
You go.

47:27.302 --> 47:28.846
I owe you one, Uncle Fester.

47:29.471 --> 47:30.639
[Fester] Are you kidding me?

47:32.099 --> 47:34.101
We just liberated our first asylum!

47:34.184 --> 47:36.144
I live for days like this.

47:40.065 --> 47:42.776
-I'm going to get you out of here.
-What kind of angel are you?

47:42.860 --> 47:44.236
An avenging one.

47:46.780 --> 47:47.906
[panicked clamoring]

48:00.544 --> 48:02.254
[weak snarl]

48:12.180 --> 48:13.891
[raspy growls]

48:15.601 --> 48:18.186
[gunshots continue]

48:20.355 --> 48:22.316
[footsteps approaching]

48:23.233 --> 48:26.278
[breathing heavily]

48:34.369 --> 48:36.496
I told you Mama would get you out of here.

48:45.672 --> 48:47.674
I could never abandon you.

48:51.595 --> 48:53.430
Wish I could say the same.

48:55.182 --> 48:57.976
You're the reason
I've been locked away in here.

49:01.021 --> 49:02.147
You're not my mother.

49:03.148 --> 49:04.900
You're my master.

49:04.983 --> 49:06.777
Or should I say…

49:08.654 --> 49:09.738
you were.

49:10.238 --> 49:13.533
Wednesday Addams!
We both know that she's the real enemy.

49:14.284 --> 49:17.287
She's here, in the building, right now.

49:17.371 --> 49:20.040
Destiny has given us
a second chance to take her out.

49:20.999 --> 49:22.793
I'll take care of Wednesday.

49:24.461 --> 49:26.630
Right after I take care of you.

49:27.798 --> 49:30.175
I'm the only one who's ever loved you.

49:30.258 --> 49:32.302
I unlocked your true potential.

49:32.928 --> 49:33.971
You did.

49:35.514 --> 49:38.016
That's why I'll give you
a five-second head start.

49:38.934 --> 49:40.936
[harrowing music building]

49:43.313 --> 49:44.940
-Run.

50:23.562 --> 50:26.690
[threatening snarls]

50:26.773 --> 50:28.900
[strained] Please, Tyler.

50:30.277 --> 50:31.778
Mommy loves you.

[thunder rumbling]

50:46.084 --> 50:47.711
[panicked clamoring]

50:51.882 --> 50:55.719
Of all the women I've ever used,
you're my favorite.

50:55.802 --> 50:57.804
[sweeping, romantic music playing]

51:16.281 --> 51:17.282
[music trails off]

51:20.452 --> 51:21.578
We'll be safe in here.

51:28.752 --> 51:29.878
[frantic tapping]

51:32.172 --> 51:33.215
Who's there?

51:38.053 --> 51:40.639
[frantic breathing]

51:41.723 --> 51:43.058
Show yourself.

52:12.129 --> 52:13.421
[Slurp] Hello…

52:14.881 --> 52:18.009
old friend.

52:21.805 --> 52:22.806
[crunch]

52:36.278 --> 52:37.279
Go.

52:38.697 --> 52:39.739
Now.

52:55.797 --> 52:57.215
[roars]

53:01.928 --> 53:03.930
[elegant, sorrowful music playing]

[intricate, wrenching music playing]

53:57.108 --> 53:58.777
[officer shouting indistinctly]

53:58.860 --> 54:00.654
Somebody get an ambulance!

54:00.737 --> 54:03.573
[Wednesday] I've always dreamed
of looking death in the face.

54:03.657 --> 54:05.075
But in my final moments,

54:05.158 --> 54:08.203
all I hear is my mother's words
ringing in my ears.

54:08.870 --> 54:11.289
Maybe I have made everything worse.

54:11.373 --> 54:12.749
[music halts]

54:12.832 --> 54:14.167
Much worse.

54:14.751 --> 54:16.753
