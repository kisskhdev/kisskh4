WEBVTT

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:42.960
The Nice Guy

00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:45.295
THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL,
AND THE PERSONS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:46.588
SETTINGS AND EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
SERIES HAVE BEEN FICTIONALLY CREATED

00:00:46.672 --> 00:00:47.756
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:48.966
WITH THE CONSENT OF
AND IN THE PRESENCE OF GUARDIANS

00:00:57.474 --> 00:00:59.059
How did the talk go?

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:04.189
The CEO seems to be very fond of you.

00:01:05.816 --> 00:01:06.817
It might work out.

00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:08.527
Good luck.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.903
What is going on here?

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:12.573
I said I wanted to help you.

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:16.034
What do you want to hear from me?

00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:18.579
You want me to thank you?

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:21.707
Is it fun
to play with someone else's life?

00:01:25.877 --> 00:01:29.256
I refuse to cater to your mood,
so go.

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:30.549
Miyoung, wait.

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:31.633
- Let go.
- Wait.

00:01:31.717 --> 00:01:33.176
- Let go of me.
- Hear me out!

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:36.972
Can't you stop pushing me away?

00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:38.890
I also have a heart that breaks.

00:01:44.438 --> 00:01:45.439
Let go of her.

00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:50.485
What are you doing?

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:54.406
Don't get the wrong idea.
I talked to her about work only to help.

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.366
Help her with what?

00:01:57.868 --> 00:02:00.620
Miyoung's dream is to be a singer.
I want to help her.

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:02.664
And why would you help her?

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:05.667
Because you can't.

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:10.464
- Seokcheol.
- And I can, so I will.

00:02:15.177 --> 00:02:16.678
Don't bother about him, okay?

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:18.180
Let's go, please.

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:22.392
Call me if you need me
before I change my mind.

00:02:24.186 --> 00:02:25.187
Taehoon.

00:02:25.896 --> 00:02:28.649
If you keep this up,
it'll get very awkward between us.

00:02:33.654 --> 00:02:34.655
"Awkward"?

00:02:39.076 --> 00:02:42.162
Look. I thought we'd be different.

00:02:45.624 --> 00:02:46.708
Seokcheol,

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.004
I'm not at all at ease around you either.

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:54.132
Seokcheol.

00:02:59.137 --> 00:03:00.472
Let's go.

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:02.474
Go. Don't come back here again.

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:06.520
Good-bye.

00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:14.319
It's okay.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.330
<i>Taehoon.</i>

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:28.542
<i>If you keep this up,</i>
<i>it'll get very awkward between us.</i>

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:48.645
- What?
- You were scary back there.

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.690
I can be quite scary when I get mad.

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:53.817
Okay.

00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:55.986
Oh, right. This is for you.

00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:58.029
What is it?

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.824
I bought it because it was pretty.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:03.118
It's a bit similar
to the one from the drawing.

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:07.747
What? You don't like it?

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:14.337
I'm touched.

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:16.548
That's a relief.

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:21.678
Seokcheol.

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:27.434
- Why don't we go somewhere?
- Go where?

00:04:28.477 --> 00:04:29.478
Somewhere far away.

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:32.397
Oh. Far away? Where?

00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:36.818
You know,
just anywhere far away that isn't here.

00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:38.945
Why don't we just go now?

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:43.325
All right, let's go.

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:49.414
- Two tickets to Gangneung, please.
- Sure. It'll be the last bus.

00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:54.252
- The bus will be here in five minutes.
- Okay, thank you.

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:59.549
One ticket to Gangneung, please.

00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:14.272
Miyoung.

00:05:16.608 --> 00:05:17.609
Miyoung?

00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:20.654
Miyoung.

00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:23.073
Miyoung!

00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:26.952
Miyoung!

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:31.414
Seokcheol.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.370
<i>I love you.</i>

00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:35.955
<i>I've loved you for a long time now.</i>

00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:38.583
<i>And I'll love you in the future too.</i>

00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:41.294
<i>I love you too.</i>

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:44.255
<i>I've loved you for a long time now.</i>

00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:48.093
<i>And I'll love you in the future too.</i>

00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:55.725
The Nice Guy

00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:05.402


00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:09.364


00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:15.662
Come on.
Kicks are only for losers.

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:18.456
Remember the thunderbolt skill
that I taught you?

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.625
That's the best fighting skill.

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:23.837
But it hurts to practice that skill.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.132
If it hurts you,
it'll be worse for the other person.

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:29.509
It will be like
getting struck by a thunderbolt.

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:32.262
Watch closely.
I'll demonstrate it for you.

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:37.058
So, this kid in your class teases you
for your mom not coming to school, right?

00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:39.853
Yes, he's the strongest one in school.

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.730
It's all right. Don't be scared.

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:45.859
When it comes to a fight,
you lose when you get scared.

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:50.030
If he tries to tease you again,
don't get whiny and go, "Stop teasing me."

00:08:50.113 --> 00:08:52.282
Glare at him like this, okay?

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.492
Try it. Make a fierce glare.

00:08:55.994 --> 00:08:57.829
Oh, goodness.

00:08:57.912 --> 00:09:00.415
I said glare,
not roll your eyes into your head.

00:09:00.498 --> 00:09:02.417
Glare with spite, like me.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.461
Strain your eyes.

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:07.464
- Like this?
- Yes.

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:12.135
But if I glare at him,
he'll punch me for sure.

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:14.971
So don't give him the chance.

00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:19.517
When you feel like he'll punch you,
grab him and do this.

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:21.269
Ow! Oh, my. My head's spinning.

00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:23.438
Headbutt him like that.

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:24.522
Gosh, I'm dizzy.

00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:28.026
This has been our family's secret skill
for generations.

00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:30.945
It's our secret skill. Got it?

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:32.530
Now, give it a try.

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:34.199
Glare at it.

00:09:34.282 --> 00:09:35.909
Grab it. Right.

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:39.079
Ahhh!

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:41.122
I won't do it.

00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:44.876
How did a softie like you
come from this family?

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.129
No one in this family
has ever allowed anyone to hit them.

00:09:51.174 --> 00:09:55.011
Well, I guess you won't cause any trouble
for your mom. That's what matters.

00:09:55.095 --> 00:09:57.347
It's okay. Mom will come back soon.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:02.143
Then, I'll go to school with Mom.
I don't have to practice the thunderbolt.

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:05.355
Right, don't.

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:08.233
I'll bring your mom over soon.

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:09.776
- Really?
- Yes.

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:12.362
- So get up. Let's go eat.
- Okay.

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:15.240
Dust off your buttocks.

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:17.867
Let's see who runs faster.

00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:32.507
<i>I'll be there</i>
<i>to take your sister tomorrow.</i>

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.440
She couldn't have run off.

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:54.821
Where have you been?

00:10:55.864 --> 00:10:58.241
I was out buying some tofu.

00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:00.994
Don't do such things without telling me
You freaked me out.

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:02.412
I wanted to cook for you.

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:04.497
You're acting unusual
already in the morning.

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:05.999
Gosh.

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:09.210
Mom texted me yesterday.

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:12.672
She's coming to get me tomorrow.

00:11:13.882 --> 00:11:14.966
She texted me too.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.677
- So?
- So?

00:11:20.305 --> 00:11:21.306
I'm going back.

00:11:23.725 --> 00:11:26.352
But I still don't have the courage
to face Father.

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:30.273
Seokkyung,

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:32.775
Hyeonggeun has been praying
that you'll come home

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:35.236
when the lilac tree starts blooming.

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:41.117
How impressive of you
to make a 7-year-old kid rely on religion.

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:44.579
- My boy remembers the lilac tree?
- Yes.

00:11:48.499 --> 00:11:51.252
When the lilac petals
would scatter in the yard,

00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:54.756
he'd get excited,
saying, "This is like snow!"

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:57.675
I should go back.

00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:59.469
Yes, I should.

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:00.762
I should go back.

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:10.521
It's not like you to be this obedient.

00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:12.815
One should know when to be obedient.

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:14.400
I'm sick of it.

00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:17.320
I'm sick of living off someone.

00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:20.073
I'm sick of living in pitch darkness.

00:12:23.534 --> 00:12:26.496
Pitch darkness? What do you mean?

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.960
"You can't picture your future
unless you unfold the cards."

00:12:32.043 --> 00:12:33.044
It's what gamblers say.

00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:38.132
Oh! Oh, goodness.

00:12:57.777 --> 00:12:59.654
Are you still angry?

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:03.157
I texted you that I was still half angry.

00:13:04.367 --> 00:13:06.577
When will all your anger go away then?

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:10.832
It's not going to go away
so easily.

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:15.962
Seokhee.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.756
I'll behave.

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:22.176
That's no use.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.262
Because half the anger
is directed at myself.

00:13:24.345 --> 00:13:28.933
Why would you be angry at yourself?
Just take all your anger out on me.

00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:31.978
I don't want to get angry with you
for my own problem.

00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:33.354
It's mine to deal with.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.315
What is your problem?

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:38.735
I don't see it.

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:40.570
What? You can't see?

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:41.738
My dream.

00:13:42.363 --> 00:13:43.489
I don't see my dream.

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:47.285
I can't picture my future.

00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:49.704
It's like pitch darkness.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:51.956
Pitch darkness?

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:55.543
You wouldn't know its meaning.
It's a term my sister uses.

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:58.337
It kind of means that you feel hopeless.

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:04.093
I used to dream of becoming a nurse.

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:07.388
Then, my future was
to become a good nurse.

00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:09.474
Now, I don't see it.

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:11.893
I don't see my future.

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:14.437
I can't picture it.

00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:19.150
I guess you're burned out.

00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:22.987
I hear nurses go through a lot
during their fifth year of training.

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:26.657
You have no right to comfort me.

00:14:27.241 --> 00:14:28.993
You're partly responsible for it.

00:14:32.955 --> 00:14:34.207
Seokhee.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.462
Why don't we go somewhere in a while
to get fresh air then?

00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:41.798
For a change, you know.
I know a good place nearby.

00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:45.843
Where?

00:14:45.927 --> 00:14:49.514
It's close by. We can get there quickly.

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:52.809
And I hear it's very hip.
I did some research about it.

00:14:53.392 --> 00:14:55.394
Like this and that.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.988
Thank you.
I'll escort you safely with kindness.

00:15:06.072 --> 00:15:07.698
- I'm sorry. Thank you.
- Jeez.

00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:14.705
The weather is so nice.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.041
It's nice.

00:15:18.793 --> 00:15:21.546
It feels different based on
which arm you use to link arms with me.

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:23.047
- Is it better for you too?
- Yes.

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:25.007
Really? Compared to...
Oh, you're right.

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:26.467
- Right.
- That's crazy.

00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:29.428
Wait. Like this.

00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:31.139
- Try it.
- Should I?

00:15:32.223 --> 00:15:33.516
I can't clap behind my back.

00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:34.600
- Why?
- I don't know.

00:15:34.684 --> 00:15:37.103
Wait. You really can't. Oh.

00:15:38.896 --> 00:15:41.399
Seokcheol, don't I remind you
of something?

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:44.026
What?

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:46.946
Oh, the drawing at your place.

00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:49.448
- Yes, that poster.
- Right.

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:51.868
It's totally like that poster
to be here in this.

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:54.120
- You're right.
- With a piano, it'll be perfect.

00:15:54.203 --> 00:15:57.415
- Who's going to move the piano?
- You will.

00:15:57.498 --> 00:15:59.375
Because you're strong.

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:29.822
THE LATE KANG SEOYEON

00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:31.073
Seoyeon.

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:34.368
Things have become a bit messy

00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:38.164
between me and Seokcheol

00:16:39.415 --> 00:16:40.416
with regard to work

00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:42.418
and a woman.

00:16:44.795 --> 00:16:46.380
Everything got complicated.

00:16:50.718 --> 00:16:52.011
Seokcheol...

00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:55.640
is planning to kill me.

00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:05.816
I don't know what to do.

00:17:21.624 --> 00:17:24.085
Taehoon, let them come
pay their condolences.

00:17:25.253 --> 00:17:26.545
Talk it out with them.

00:17:27.338 --> 00:17:29.507
- After the funeral.
- Call them.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:30.633
Tell them not to come.

00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:34.637
I don't want to lose myself
at my sister's funeral.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.889
Hello, Mr. Chairman.

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:40.184
Damn, they're so freaking diligent.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.311
Taehoon.

00:17:43.312 --> 00:17:44.313
I get it.

00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:46.566
Let go of me.

00:17:48.442 --> 00:17:50.319
<i>My little sister is in there.</i>

00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:52.238
I mean, Seoyeon.

00:17:52.863 --> 00:17:55.700
She died because we couldn't get
30 million won for her surgery.

00:17:56.993 --> 00:17:59.036
- Changsoo.
- That's enough.

00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:01.539
- Changsoo!
- Punk.

00:18:01.622 --> 00:18:03.040
Be respectful towards him.

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:05.918
Listen, I get it!
I know it's hard, but be polite--

00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:08.254
- Why should I be polite to him, huh?
- Taehoon! Don't!

00:18:08.337 --> 00:18:10.006
Snap out of it, punk.

00:18:13.843 --> 00:18:15.344
Let's go, Sangyeol.

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:16.512
Take it back.

00:18:18.014 --> 00:18:19.181
Take it back.

00:18:20.224 --> 00:18:21.225
Take it all back.

00:18:21.684 --> 00:18:24.854
Take it back, you damn thug!

00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:29.567
Did you think
you could walk away that easily?

00:18:32.236 --> 00:18:34.572
- What is it, punk?
- That's enough.

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:36.866
Are you out of your mind? Let go.

00:18:38.534 --> 00:18:41.829
- Stop it.
- Show some respect, you rude bastard.

00:18:42.496 --> 00:18:44.457
You're way younger than me.

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.500
Say that again, punk.

00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:48.961
Please let him go.

00:18:54.508 --> 00:18:55.676
I'm begging you, sir.

00:18:56.802 --> 00:19:00.348
I can't believe this.

00:19:02.058 --> 00:19:03.476
Fine, let's do that.

00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:11.525
How tearjerking.

00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:19.408
Goodness.

00:19:21.118 --> 00:19:23.579
- Taehoon, you think you can stand up?
- Yes.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.387
Seokcheol.

00:19:42.473 --> 00:19:43.474
I'll go alone.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:47.269
We're not colleagues anymore.

00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:51.607
Bye.

00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:53.693
MYOUNGSAN INDUSTRIES

00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:08.708
Seokcheol.

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:13.838
I should've looked after you as an elder,

00:20:14.922 --> 00:20:16.340
but I owed you so much instead.

00:20:20.094 --> 00:20:21.095
I won't forget.

00:20:23.764 --> 00:20:24.807
Take care.

00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:32.898
I'll come again.

00:20:43.492 --> 00:20:45.953
The men are ready. They can be trusted.

00:20:46.704 --> 00:20:47.913
Are they not from here?

00:20:48.414 --> 00:20:49.832
No, but...

00:20:52.668 --> 00:20:53.836
But what?

00:20:54.962 --> 00:20:56.046
Do you want him dead?

00:21:01.552 --> 00:21:02.553
Cheonho,

00:21:04.638 --> 00:21:05.848
stick to your orders.

00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:20.821
MYOUNGSAN INDUSTRIES

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:21.906
Say that again.

00:21:22.531 --> 00:21:23.532
What did you say?

00:21:24.366 --> 00:21:25.701
I apologize.

00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:28.120
Dusik can't be reached.

00:21:36.003 --> 00:21:40.382
Dusik can't be reached?

00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:46.138
Smile, punk.

00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:49.975
It'll bring you happiness, so smile.

00:21:52.353 --> 00:21:53.437
I apologize.

00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:57.733
You can't smile, can you?
But smile because I want you to.

00:21:57.817 --> 00:22:00.861
I'm giving you a chance
Can't you?

00:22:07.117 --> 00:22:09.787
- Pick what you like.
- Pardon?

00:22:10.996 --> 00:22:13.582
A golf club or a bat. Pick one of these.

00:22:15.543 --> 00:22:16.627
Well...

00:22:18.379 --> 00:22:19.380
Mr. Chairman!

00:22:20.548 --> 00:22:23.384
A bat seems like the better choice.

00:22:39.692 --> 00:22:42.987
You're seriously
going to make me die early, aren't you?

00:22:43.571 --> 00:22:45.072
- Get back down.
- Yes, sir.

00:22:48.909 --> 00:22:50.995
Sir, are you okay?

00:22:58.752 --> 00:22:59.753
How many did you take?

00:23:00.629 --> 00:23:03.299
You didn't count? You're asking for more.

00:23:03.757 --> 00:23:05.092
- Get back there.
- Yes, sir.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.484
Good-bye, sir.

00:23:27.197 --> 00:23:29.199
What are you looking at? Get back to work!

00:23:29.283 --> 00:23:30.492
Yes, sir.

00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:35.247
Where's Seokcheol?

00:23:35.331 --> 00:23:38.042
He can't come to work today
due to some other business.

00:23:38.125 --> 00:23:39.835
That punk really...

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:42.880
Are you okay, sir?

00:23:49.511 --> 00:23:50.512
<i>So?</i>

00:23:50.596 --> 00:23:53.682
So, it was way past 9:00 p.m.

00:23:53.766 --> 00:23:56.477
You can imagine how dark it must've been.

00:23:56.977 --> 00:23:59.605
And kids weren't allowed to have phones
at that time.

00:23:59.688 --> 00:24:00.773
Right.

00:24:00.856 --> 00:24:03.692
I think Seokhee was around 10 then.

00:24:03.776 --> 00:24:05.778
Right, because I was in sixth grade.

00:24:05.861 --> 00:24:08.113
What was she up to until that hour?

00:24:08.197 --> 00:24:09.490
Who knows?

00:24:09.573 --> 00:24:12.534
Our father, in his pajamas,
went out on a bicycle to find her.

00:24:12.618 --> 00:24:14.620
I ran around the neighborhood too.

00:24:15.537 --> 00:24:18.582
It was so dark, there were no streetlamps.
I sensed it was serious.

00:24:18.666 --> 00:24:21.085
But then, from afar,

00:24:21.168 --> 00:24:23.379
I saw a little girl
approaching with someone.

00:24:23.462 --> 00:24:25.422
- Seokhee?
- Yes.

00:24:25.506 --> 00:24:26.507
With Seokkyung.

00:24:27.216 --> 00:24:28.217
Seokkyung found her?

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.428
That's hard to tell.

00:24:31.512 --> 00:24:33.013
It's not that she found Seokhee.

00:24:33.097 --> 00:24:35.140
- Rather that Seokhee spotted her.
- What?

00:24:35.224 --> 00:24:38.185
She was wandering
on a ridge between rice paddies

00:24:38.268 --> 00:24:41.605
when she saw a cigarette light from afar.

00:24:41.689 --> 00:24:43.983
She figured it was someone
and dashed toward her.

00:24:44.066 --> 00:24:45.859
It turned out to be Seokkyung.

00:24:47.778 --> 00:24:48.821
Are you serious?

00:24:48.904 --> 00:24:52.783
As soon as Seokhee met her,
she called out to her and cried in relief.

00:24:52.866 --> 00:24:54.451
- Oh!
- Then, Seokkyung said,

00:24:54.535 --> 00:24:57.579
"If you tell Dad that I smoked,
I'll leave you here."

00:25:00.541 --> 00:25:02.376
- Your food is ready.
- Okay.

00:25:02.459 --> 00:25:03.794
That's insane.

00:25:03.877 --> 00:25:05.587
She's been like that
since childhood.

00:25:05.671 --> 00:25:07.297
Is this about Seokhee or Seokkyung?

00:25:08.424 --> 00:25:10.175
Both, I guess.

00:25:10.592 --> 00:25:12.136
- It looks good.
- Thanks.

00:25:12.761 --> 00:25:14.013
Thank you.

00:25:14.096 --> 00:25:15.556
How appetizing.

00:25:15.639 --> 00:25:17.391
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

00:25:18.851 --> 00:25:20.394
SANGYEOL

00:25:20.477 --> 00:25:22.730
It looks amazing. How pretty.

00:25:22.813 --> 00:25:24.398
- Eat up.
- I'll cut it for you.

00:25:24.982 --> 00:25:28.235
<i>The person you called is unavailable--</i>

00:25:30.362 --> 00:25:31.447
That punk.

00:25:34.408 --> 00:25:36.577
Now you're ignoring me too?

00:25:38.495 --> 00:25:40.122
Goodness.

00:25:40.706 --> 00:25:41.874
Wait.

00:25:41.957 --> 00:25:43.000
This is...

00:25:45.502 --> 00:25:46.503
Gosh.

00:25:47.087 --> 00:25:48.213
Hey!

00:25:48.297 --> 00:25:51.633
- Hey. Where is my suit?
- Which one?

00:25:51.717 --> 00:25:54.887
My favorite white suit.
The one from my father.

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:56.096
I'm having it dry-cleaned.

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:57.639
What... Go get it now.

00:25:57.723 --> 00:25:59.183
Just wear something else.

00:25:59.266 --> 00:26:01.060
Go get it now.

00:26:01.143 --> 00:26:03.312
Yes, you want me to obey and follow.

00:26:06.023 --> 00:26:07.441
Goodness.

00:26:27.294 --> 00:26:29.129
Oh, my goodness!

00:26:30.506 --> 00:26:32.382
Who is it?

00:26:36.011 --> 00:26:37.930
Who is it?

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.849
- Open the door.
- Who...

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.601
What?

00:26:43.393 --> 00:26:47.189
It's me, your friend, Go Jeongnim.

00:26:49.108 --> 00:26:51.068
Ta-da!

00:26:51.985 --> 00:26:54.154
I'm here for you.

00:26:54.238 --> 00:26:55.489
Goodness.

00:26:55.572 --> 00:26:56.990
Hey, this is insane.

00:26:57.741 --> 00:26:59.409
What a nice house.

00:26:59.493 --> 00:27:01.662
- Don't touch anything.
- You startled me.

00:27:02.246 --> 00:27:03.705
Jeez.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.375
You really are impressive.

00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:08.127
How did you find me here?

00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:10.963
I heard you were staying at Seokhee's.

00:27:11.046 --> 00:27:12.881
I asked around the neighborhood

00:27:12.965 --> 00:27:15.551
If they knew
where the temperamental nurse lived.

00:27:15.634 --> 00:27:20.180
Hey, don't hate her too much.
She may not seem like it, but she's kind.

00:27:20.264 --> 00:27:21.682
As if.

00:27:21.765 --> 00:27:24.142
Your sister kicked me out of the hospital.

00:27:25.352 --> 00:27:29.565
I was pleading how sick I was,
but she made a fuss and forced me out.

00:27:29.648 --> 00:27:31.108
Jeez, what is this? No way!

00:27:31.191 --> 00:27:32.776
Hey.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.945
You still have this?

00:27:35.028 --> 00:27:37.072
How adorable!

00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:39.324
- You're unbelievable.
- Give it to me.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.785
And if you have nothing to say, just go.

00:27:41.869 --> 00:27:43.453
You don't want Seokhee to see you here.

00:27:45.372 --> 00:27:46.373
What?

00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:51.336
I have nowhere to go.

00:27:52.004 --> 00:27:54.715
I mean, the gambling house is down
because of you.

00:27:58.844 --> 00:28:01.263
Speaking of which, Seokkyung...

00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:02.347
Come here.

00:28:02.431 --> 00:28:04.808
- What is it this time?
- Come.

00:28:04.892 --> 00:28:06.351
- Goodness.
- Come.

00:28:07.019 --> 00:28:08.020
You nasty girl.

00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:13.817
You know Changrak, right?

00:28:13.901 --> 00:28:15.068
My ex-boyfriend.

00:28:15.152 --> 00:28:16.236
Changrak...

00:28:16.987 --> 00:28:18.697
- The one with slanted eyes?
- Yes.

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:20.490
You're still in touch with him?

00:28:20.574 --> 00:28:24.828
Well, after his time in prison,
he's changed. He's not the same.

00:28:24.912 --> 00:28:26.371
He quit drinking too.

00:28:26.997 --> 00:28:29.333
You still believe him
after all that he did to you?

00:28:29.416 --> 00:28:33.128
It's not that he's believable.
I want to believe him.

00:28:33.211 --> 00:28:34.504
Anyway, he...

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:39.593
He lends money in exchange for cars
near a casino. He's quite successful.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.387
I hear he's totally settled down.

00:28:42.471 --> 00:28:44.556
He owns an actual pawnshop.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.350
- A car pawnbroker?
- Yes.

00:28:46.433 --> 00:28:48.727
Hey, you know that's our specialty.

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:52.481
Changrak is so busy these days.
He's short-staffed.

00:28:54.441 --> 00:28:55.442
So, what do you say

00:28:56.818 --> 00:28:58.195
we go work there together?

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:00.948
Well...

00:29:01.823 --> 00:29:03.283
- Gosh, girl.
- What?

00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:06.244
I'm going back home tomorrow.

00:29:08.372 --> 00:29:10.791
Home... What home?

00:29:11.833 --> 00:29:15.128
You're broke.
You should be too ashamed to go home.

00:29:15.796 --> 00:29:16.880
What...

00:29:20.258 --> 00:29:24.012
Come on, go to Gangwon-do with me.
Let's get down to this business.

00:29:24.096 --> 00:29:27.057
You know car pawnbrokers can make
100 million won a year

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.266
once they settle down.

00:29:29.059 --> 00:29:33.105
Work hard for just one year,
and go home with money.

00:29:33.188 --> 00:29:36.149
I wouldn't suggest this idea
to anyone else but you.

00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:44.116
You see, to be honest,

00:29:45.117 --> 00:29:46.868
I feel sorry for you in many ways.

00:29:48.203 --> 00:29:49.997
I'm the one who taught you how to gamble.

00:29:50.539 --> 00:29:54.292
I'm the one who caused your family
to lose your house.

00:29:54.376 --> 00:29:57.546
I'm telling you this to help you.

00:29:57.629 --> 00:29:59.673
You crazy... At least you know.

00:30:04.386 --> 00:30:08.098
We have to take a night bus
to Gangwon-do today.

00:30:08.181 --> 00:30:09.850
Give it some thought, okay?

00:30:10.517 --> 00:30:12.602
Or they'll have to find someone else.

00:30:13.186 --> 00:30:15.063
It's better that we take the job.

00:30:25.073 --> 00:30:28.827
Gosh, you should just wear
the one Seokhee bought you.

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:31.747
No one wears a suit like this these days.

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:34.416
Maybe only those circus hosts do.

00:30:34.499 --> 00:30:37.044
You'll draw everyone's attention outside.

00:30:37.127 --> 00:30:40.505
Don't worry. I wear this for attention.

00:30:42.466 --> 00:30:44.426
You have some business to attend to today?

00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:47.554
Yes, I'm going to meet Tick
and borrow some money.

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:52.267
Don't you worry.

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:55.062
He's not going to take
a private loan interest from me.

00:30:55.145 --> 00:30:56.521
How much are you going to borrow?

00:30:57.647 --> 00:31:00.734
70 million won at first
to pay off the bank loan.

00:31:01.276 --> 00:31:03.487
And I'll find an apartment for us
later on.

00:31:06.615 --> 00:31:09.284
You'll be at home tomorrow, right?

00:31:09.367 --> 00:31:10.619
Tomorrow? Why?

00:31:11.119 --> 00:31:13.538
I was just wondering if you'll be home.

00:31:13.622 --> 00:31:15.665
You're being silly.

00:31:15.749 --> 00:31:16.750
I'll be back.

00:31:17.209 --> 00:31:18.376
Your zipper.

00:31:18.877 --> 00:31:21.296
Oh, right. Thanks.

00:31:23.465 --> 00:31:25.217
- See you.
- Bye.

00:31:33.558 --> 00:31:38.313
Sir, I'm sorry I can't be of much help
regarding your bank issue.

00:31:38.396 --> 00:31:39.648
No, don't mention it.

00:31:40.273 --> 00:31:41.817
If not for you,

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:45.237
the branch manager wouldn't have
even talked to me in person.

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.322
Thanks.

00:31:47.405 --> 00:31:48.824
No problem at all.

00:31:48.907 --> 00:31:52.244
It's nothing
compared to all that you did for me.

00:31:54.079 --> 00:31:57.374
Anyway, how's your business doing?

00:31:57.457 --> 00:31:58.458
These days?

00:31:58.959 --> 00:32:02.420
The loan shark business
is just as tough.

00:32:02.504 --> 00:32:06.049
I'm a loan shark myself,
but I'd like to borrow money too.

00:32:07.717 --> 00:32:10.178
Is that so?

00:32:10.637 --> 00:32:14.141
Did you want to tell me something
in private?

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:17.561
No.

00:32:18.019 --> 00:32:21.148
You're struggling just as much.

00:32:21.231 --> 00:32:22.440
Jeez.

00:32:22.524 --> 00:32:24.401
Damn it, Tick.

00:32:24.484 --> 00:32:26.736
You know what he wants to discuss
with you.

00:32:27.445 --> 00:32:30.031
Look at you changing the subject
for someone so quick-witted.

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:34.244
His house is mortgaged to the bank.
It's about to be auctioned--

00:32:34.327 --> 00:32:35.328
Stop.

00:32:41.001 --> 00:32:42.669
- Tick.
- Yes, sir.

00:32:43.253 --> 00:32:46.756
Truth be told,
I'm currently in need of money.

00:32:47.424 --> 00:32:48.925
Could I ask you for help?

00:32:51.595 --> 00:32:53.346
Sir, how much do you need?

00:32:54.764 --> 00:32:58.727
- Can you lend me around 70 million won?
- 70 million?

00:33:00.353 --> 00:33:05.317
Gosh,
you should've told me sooner.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:09.988
You're not one to talk much about money,
so I had no idea.

00:33:10.071 --> 00:33:12.157
I see.

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:15.076
Things happened to be this way
in my later years.

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:18.330
I'll wire the money to your account
at the date you want.

00:33:19.539 --> 00:33:21.791
Gosh, thanks.

00:33:21.875 --> 00:33:23.793
I'll take only around 10% interest.

00:33:26.296 --> 00:33:27.297
What?

00:33:27.964 --> 00:33:29.132
You ungrateful punk.

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:31.801
You'll take interest from him?

00:33:31.885 --> 00:33:33.261
Should I just...

00:33:38.558 --> 00:33:40.477
Follow me out. Come.

00:33:42.187 --> 00:33:44.147
You punk, if not for him,

00:33:44.231 --> 00:33:46.983
you'd still be homeless
at Cheonggyecheon Stream.

00:33:47.484 --> 00:33:48.485
Follow me out.

00:33:49.194 --> 00:33:50.278
- Now!
- Hey.

00:33:50.362 --> 00:33:52.614
I'm not even asking
for prior interest or collateral.

00:33:52.697 --> 00:33:55.075
I'm showing
more than enough respect for him.

00:33:55.158 --> 00:33:57.160
What? Goodness!

00:33:57.994 --> 00:34:00.080
You really want to die, is that it?

00:34:00.664 --> 00:34:02.165
Is that what you want?

00:34:02.249 --> 00:34:04.251
Quiet down. The customers are watching.

00:34:04.334 --> 00:34:05.335
Sir.

00:34:07.754 --> 00:34:09.172
- Tick.
- Yes, sir.

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:15.345
Thanks. I'll pay you back
with all the interest.

00:34:18.265 --> 00:34:19.266
Damn him.

00:34:36.658 --> 00:34:40.120
Sir, isn't he being
so disloyal and heartless?

00:34:40.203 --> 00:34:42.038
How could that bastard do this to...

00:34:56.469 --> 00:34:57.470
Ah.

00:35:11.192 --> 00:35:12.444
Seokkyung.

00:35:15.905 --> 00:35:17.115
Seokkyung.

00:35:17.741 --> 00:35:18.950
Seokkyung?

00:35:24.331 --> 00:35:27.125
<i>Mom, I'm sorry.</i>

00:35:27.208 --> 00:35:28.585
Seokkyung!

00:35:28.668 --> 00:35:29.919
Seokkyung!

00:35:30.003 --> 00:35:31.087
Seokkyung.

00:35:31.671 --> 00:35:32.881
Seokkyung.

00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:35.175
Seokkyung!

00:35:35.842 --> 00:35:37.260
Seokkyung!

00:35:37.344 --> 00:35:39.012
Seokkyung!

00:35:40.013 --> 00:35:43.058
Seokkyung. Seokkyung.

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:45.685
Seokkyung... Seokkyung...

00:35:46.728 --> 00:35:48.355
- Seokkyung...
- Grandma.

00:35:48.438 --> 00:35:50.065
Grandma!

00:35:52.275 --> 00:35:54.486
Grandma, did you have a nightmare?

00:35:55.487 --> 00:35:56.488
What?

00:35:57.447 --> 00:35:58.657
No, it's nothing.

00:35:59.616 --> 00:36:02.077
Did Mom appear in your dream?

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:05.205
You kept calling her name.

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:06.956
Did I?

00:36:07.499 --> 00:36:10.502
Yes. Do you miss her too?

00:36:11.378 --> 00:36:12.796
Of course.

00:36:13.463 --> 00:36:15.548
I miss her so much.

00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:18.843
I miss her too.

00:36:19.719 --> 00:36:22.347
Gosh, do you?

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:26.267
I can't believe she's not coming back
to see you, my adorable puppy.

00:36:28.144 --> 00:36:29.938
- Go back to drawing.
- Okay.

00:36:44.828 --> 00:36:47.163
WE PURCHASE CARS AT A HIGH PRICE

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.257


00:37:00.802 --> 00:37:04.180
<i>He lends money</i>
<i>in exchange for cars near a casino.</i>

00:37:04.264 --> 00:37:05.473
<i>He's quite successful.</i>

00:37:05.557 --> 00:37:07.767
<i>I hear he's totally settled down.</i>

00:37:07.851 --> 00:37:09.519
<i>He owns...</i>

00:37:39.507 --> 00:37:40.800
- Isn't it tiring?
- No.

00:37:45.847 --> 00:37:47.182
How refreshing.

00:37:48.057 --> 00:37:50.185
Gosh, you're exhausted.

00:37:52.061 --> 00:37:53.605
Look here and smile.

00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:58.693
It came out well.

00:38:00.236 --> 00:38:02.614
Let's take selfies too.

00:38:06.367 --> 00:38:07.368
Mmm.

00:38:09.245 --> 00:38:10.538
- Want some noodles?
- Sure.

00:38:10.622 --> 00:38:12.248
Hold on.

00:38:13.541 --> 00:38:15.293
- Hi, Mom.
- <i>Where are you?</i>

00:38:15.376 --> 00:38:18.213
- I'm out with Kihong.
<i>- Come meet me right now.</i>

00:38:18.713 --> 00:38:21.341
- At your house? Now?
<i>- Yes.</i>

00:38:21.424 --> 00:38:24.010
<i>I'll go bring your sister back home today.</i>

00:38:24.093 --> 00:38:26.721
I feel too uneasy to wait until tomorrow.

00:38:26.805 --> 00:38:30.391
<i>Mom, she's made up her mind.</i>
<i>She won't run away.</i>

00:38:30.475 --> 00:38:34.312
No, she's one to run away for sure.
Come right over now.

00:38:35.188 --> 00:38:36.564
What...

00:38:37.732 --> 00:38:38.900
What? What did she say?

00:38:38.983 --> 00:38:40.527
Oh, man.

00:38:54.749 --> 00:38:57.377
<i>Hey, you know that's our specialty.</i>

00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:00.839
<i>Changrak is so busy these days.</i>
<i>He's short-staffed.</i>

00:39:07.095 --> 00:39:09.722
<i>You know car pawnbrokers can make</i>
<i>100 million won a year</i>

00:39:09.806 --> 00:39:11.808
once they settle down.

00:39:11.891 --> 00:39:16.020
Work hard for just one year,
and go home with money.

00:39:16.104 --> 00:39:19.691
I wouldn't suggest this idea
to anyone else but you.

00:39:32.412 --> 00:39:34.247
Gosh, it's relaxing.

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:36.749
The ocean
has such a beautiful color.

00:39:36.833 --> 00:39:38.835
The weather is amazing, right?

00:39:38.918 --> 00:39:40.920
Yes, I love the cool breeze.

00:39:44.716 --> 00:39:46.092
Goodness. Just a moment.

00:39:48.678 --> 00:39:50.597
- Hi.
- <i>Where are you?</i>

00:39:51.973 --> 00:39:53.224
Me?

00:39:54.475 --> 00:39:55.685
I'm on a date.

00:39:56.227 --> 00:39:59.439
<i>You picked the perfect day.</i>
<i>Mom wants to go to my house now.</i>

00:40:00.023 --> 00:40:02.400
- What? Now?
<i>- Yes.</i>

00:40:02.483 --> 00:40:05.570
She wants to go drag Seokkyung home
in case she runs away.

00:40:05.653 --> 00:40:07.280
This won't do. Come right away.

00:40:10.158 --> 00:40:12.911
But I'm out far away.

00:40:12.994 --> 00:40:14.829
<i>What do we do then?</i>

00:40:14.913 --> 00:40:17.332
I need you there stuck next to Seokkyung.

00:40:17.415 --> 00:40:20.919
If she's told to go home now,
she might really change her mind.

00:40:22.754 --> 00:40:25.423
Jeez. Okay, let's hang up for now.

00:40:43.191 --> 00:40:44.192
Hi.

00:40:50.365 --> 00:40:52.867
Hello? Seokkyung.
Where are you? At Seokhee's?

00:40:52.951 --> 00:40:54.452
<i>Yes, I'm at Seokhee's.</i>

00:40:54.535 --> 00:40:56.371
Congrats. I hear you're going back today.

00:40:56.454 --> 00:40:59.248
<i>You made a great decision.</i>

00:40:59.332 --> 00:41:00.416
- What?
<i>- You did.</i>

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:03.127
- My mom's coming tomorrow.
<i>- I just talked to Seokcheol.</i>

00:41:03.211 --> 00:41:04.879
Your mother is coming today.

00:41:04.963 --> 00:41:05.964
What?

00:41:06.047 --> 00:41:08.174
<i>I'm on my way too.</i>
<i>It'll take about 30 minutes.</i>

00:41:08.257 --> 00:41:09.342
Why are you coming?

00:41:09.425 --> 00:41:13.680
Seokcheol asked me to stay glued to you
as if I was arresting a criminal

00:41:13.763 --> 00:41:15.431
in case you changed your mind.

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:19.018
You don't have to come.

00:41:19.102 --> 00:41:23.147
<i>What are you talking about?</i>
<i>I have to go, for your safe return.</i>

00:41:23.231 --> 00:41:27.360
You're too scared of your father to go.
You'll be fine if you go with me.

00:41:27.443 --> 00:41:30.321
<i>I doubt he'll break your leg</i>
<i>in my presence.</i>

00:41:30.405 --> 00:41:32.115
<i>- And if he still tries,</i>

00:41:32.198 --> 00:41:34.993
<i>lock the doors and stay in your room.</i>
<i>I'll stop him somehow.</i>

00:41:35.076 --> 00:41:36.411
I'll see you later. Bye.

00:41:45.044 --> 00:41:47.005
<i>Seokkyung is going back home today.</i>

00:41:47.088 --> 00:41:48.089
- Really?
- Yes.

00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:49.257
That's great.

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.467
Shouldn't you go home, then?

00:41:51.551 --> 00:41:52.969
No.

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:55.346
Let me be free

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:58.182
from all my family businesses
at least for today.

00:41:58.266 --> 00:41:59.434
I'd love that.

00:42:42.894 --> 00:42:44.812
Oh, goodness.

00:42:48.858 --> 00:42:50.485
Hello, ma'am.

00:42:50.568 --> 00:42:53.321
Hi, Kihong.
Sorry we have to meet on a day like today.

00:42:53.404 --> 00:42:55.948
No, I should be here
on a good day like today.

00:42:56.032 --> 00:42:57.658
- Please get in.
- Thanks.

00:42:57.742 --> 00:42:58.951
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

00:42:59.952 --> 00:43:01.871
- Where's Dad?
- He stepped outside.

00:43:03.081 --> 00:43:04.874
We'll bring Seokkyung back home
without him?

00:43:04.957 --> 00:43:07.043
It's better than him
slamming the doors in her face.

00:43:07.919 --> 00:43:10.546
If we get her in the house
while your dad's away,

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:12.298
he won't be able to drag her out.

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.092
All right. Let's go.

00:43:14.175 --> 00:43:16.010
Okay, let's take off.

00:43:36.906 --> 00:43:37.990
All right.

00:43:45.123 --> 00:43:46.541
Seokkyung, I'm here.

00:43:46.624 --> 00:43:48.668
Do you have a lot to carry?
I'll come up if you do.

00:43:48.751 --> 00:43:50.711
<i>It's not a lot.</i>

00:43:50.795 --> 00:43:52.255
I'll wait down here, then.

00:43:52.338 --> 00:43:54.674
<i>Wait a bit. I need to fix my makeup.</i>

00:43:54.757 --> 00:43:56.134
Okay. Hurry down.

00:44:15.361 --> 00:44:17.780
You look much younger
than before.

00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:22.368
And you've become better with your words.
Now you know how to flatter.

00:44:22.451 --> 00:44:23.703
Oh, please.

00:44:23.786 --> 00:44:25.913
How could you let me see you this way?

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:29.500
You should visit your future father-in-law
from time to time.

00:44:30.084 --> 00:44:32.670
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

00:44:32.753 --> 00:44:33.921
What, am I wrong?

00:44:34.005 --> 00:44:35.631
You're right, ma'am.

00:44:35.715 --> 00:44:36.716
I mean, Mother.

00:44:38.968 --> 00:44:40.928
Goodness. I have as many as two daughters,

00:44:41.012 --> 00:44:43.055
but it's so hard
to become a mother-in-law.

00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:47.101
I'll visit you more often
from now on, Mother.

00:44:49.979 --> 00:44:51.522
I'll drive you safely, Mother!

00:44:52.315 --> 00:44:54.567
Thanks.

00:45:08.122 --> 00:45:10.666
She's taking too long to fix her makeup.

00:45:12.043 --> 00:45:13.836
It can't be.

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:16.672
It can't be. Goodness, no way.

00:45:17.506 --> 00:45:19.508
Why do I keep having this bad feeling?

00:45:20.635 --> 00:45:22.637
Maybe I should quit being a detective.

00:45:24.889 --> 00:45:25.890
Seok...

00:45:27.016 --> 00:45:28.017
Jeez!

00:45:35.066 --> 00:45:36.484
Seokkyung!

00:45:38.694 --> 00:45:40.029
Seokkyung!

00:45:40.112 --> 00:45:41.197
Goodness gracious.

00:45:52.792 --> 00:45:54.252
BYEONGSOO

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:25.283
- One ticket to Jeongseon.
- Jeongseon, sure.

00:46:25.366 --> 00:46:27.994
- The earliest one, please.
- Okay.

00:46:45.886 --> 00:46:48.306
Mom. It has a nice view.

00:46:49.015 --> 00:46:51.017
- But too many stairs.
- Watch the stairs.

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:52.977
What the...

00:46:54.145 --> 00:46:58.024
<i>I'm sorry, Byeongsoo.</i>
<i>Don't look for me.</i>

00:46:58.107 --> 00:47:00.109
<i>- Thanks for everything.</i>
- What the...

00:47:00.693 --> 00:47:03.321
- Byeongsoo.
- Oh... Oh! Ma... Ma'am!

00:47:03.404 --> 00:47:05.823
A text?

00:47:05.906 --> 00:47:07.325
You're here too.

00:47:08.075 --> 00:47:11.620
<i>Mom, take care of Hyeonggeun</i>
<i>for me for one more year.</i>

00:47:11.704 --> 00:47:14.665
<i>I'm too ashamed to face you now.</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

00:47:14.749 --> 00:47:16.208
This crazy wench!

00:47:16.292 --> 00:47:19.962
<i>Seokhee,</i>
<i>I'm wearing your socks. Sorry.</i>

00:47:20.379 --> 00:47:22.673
<i>Spend time freely with Kihong</i>
<i>at your place now.</i>

00:47:22.757 --> 00:47:24.550
She's out of her mind.

00:47:24.633 --> 00:47:26.260
- Goodness.
- Mother!

00:47:26.344 --> 00:47:28.095
- Mom.
- What's wrong?

00:47:28.179 --> 00:47:29.805
I don't know, punk.

00:47:30.431 --> 00:47:32.141
Hurry in first.

00:47:32.224 --> 00:47:33.225
Byeongsoo.

00:47:44.904 --> 00:47:48.032
<i>Seokcheol, I...</i>

00:48:16.602 --> 00:48:18.687
- Gosh, I'm so full.
- Me too.

00:48:20.606 --> 00:48:22.566
Would you like
some aromatic scorched-rice water?

00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:25.486
Oh, we're actually too full.

00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:26.987
- But thank you.
- Thank you.

00:48:28.614 --> 00:48:30.991
- I can't eat anymore.
- Same here.

00:48:33.327 --> 00:48:35.079
SEOKKYUNG

00:48:39.583 --> 00:48:40.584
You won't pick up?

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:45.631
I should.

00:48:52.138 --> 00:48:54.181
- Seokkyung?
- <i>Hey.</i>

00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:56.600
<i>Seokcheol.</i>

00:48:57.518 --> 00:48:58.894
I'm listening.

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:01.647
I'm not going home.

00:49:03.315 --> 00:49:04.442
I can't bring myself to.

00:49:08.904 --> 00:49:09.905
I'm sorry.

00:49:12.491 --> 00:49:14.994
<i>I thought I should tell you.</i>

00:49:16.912 --> 00:49:18.372
It's too much for me.

00:49:20.249 --> 00:49:21.250
You know, right?

00:49:23.586 --> 00:49:25.504
Yes, I know.

00:49:26.922 --> 00:49:27.923
I'm sorry.

00:49:30.009 --> 00:49:31.510
At least you are.

00:49:34.472 --> 00:49:37.433
<i>If you want to leave and go far away,</i>
<i>go ahead and do that.</i>

00:49:39.477 --> 00:49:42.605
<i>Instead, let me know from time to time</i>

00:49:43.439 --> 00:49:44.690
<i>that you're doing well.</i>

00:49:47.234 --> 00:49:48.235
<i>But...</i>

00:49:49.069 --> 00:49:51.030
<i>if you suddenly feel like coming back,</i>

00:49:52.823 --> 00:49:54.033
don't ignore it,

00:49:55.868 --> 00:49:57.119
because it means that

00:49:58.329 --> 00:50:00.873
one of us is missing you.

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:07.421
That's family, you know.

00:50:13.886 --> 00:50:15.596
I feel bad for Hyeonggeun.

00:50:17.348 --> 00:50:19.099
The world has lots of good moms...

00:50:19.934 --> 00:50:22.728
...but out of them all,
I happened to be his mom.

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:35.741
I need to go.

00:50:39.286 --> 00:50:40.454
Okay, go on.

00:50:41.956 --> 00:50:44.500
Call me if something happens, okay?

00:50:48.212 --> 00:50:49.296
Bye.

00:50:49.922 --> 00:50:50.923
Bye.

00:51:13.195 --> 00:51:17.700
<i>Family can be a burden</i>
<i>or a strength sometimes.</i>

00:51:18.867 --> 00:51:21.620
<i>Tearfully, my sister said</i>
<i>she couldn't return home.</i>

00:51:22.913 --> 00:51:23.998
<i>Perhaps</i>

00:51:25.082 --> 00:51:26.959
<i>family couldn't be her strength.</i>

00:51:27.793 --> 00:51:28.794
<i>Or perhaps</i>

00:51:29.545 --> 00:51:32.214
<i>she didn't want to be a burden herself.</i>

00:51:33.048 --> 00:51:34.925
We're leaving in one minute.

00:51:42.474 --> 00:51:44.685
MOM

00:51:48.689 --> 00:51:50.691
HORRIBLE WENCH

00:52:13.088 --> 00:52:14.548
POWER OFF

00:52:18.469 --> 00:52:19.845
We're leaving.

00:52:40.574 --> 00:52:42.451
- Just drop us off here.
- Okay.

00:52:42.534 --> 00:52:44.411
- My dad might be asleep.
- Got it.

00:52:57.049 --> 00:52:59.843
I'll sleep over here tonight.
You can go home.

00:52:59.927 --> 00:53:00.928
Okay.

00:53:01.428 --> 00:53:02.429
Thank you.

00:53:02.846 --> 00:53:06.141
Go in and get some good rest for now.

00:53:06.892 --> 00:53:07.893
Bye.

00:53:12.648 --> 00:53:14.733
Don't show it to your father.

00:53:15.317 --> 00:53:17.236
Tell him we had dinner together.

00:53:17.319 --> 00:53:18.404
Of course.

00:53:35.129 --> 00:53:36.213
Dad!

00:53:37.339 --> 00:53:39.007
Wait. Hey, you...

00:53:39.091 --> 00:53:41.885
Hey, hey, hey.

00:53:41.969 --> 00:53:43.178
Have you been well?

00:53:43.262 --> 00:53:46.640
Stop this. You're a grown-up woman.

00:53:46.724 --> 00:53:49.685
- We came back after dinner together.
- I see.

00:53:49.768 --> 00:53:50.811
I'm sleeping over here.

00:53:50.894 --> 00:53:52.771
Why? You have a home of your own.

00:53:52.855 --> 00:53:55.566
To chat with you and stuff.

00:53:55.649 --> 00:53:57.651
- Is Hyeonggeun asleep?
- He fell asleep just now.

00:53:57.735 --> 00:53:59.194
- Don't wake him up.
- Auntie is here.

00:54:04.992 --> 00:54:06.452
Why are you in a daze?

00:54:07.411 --> 00:54:08.829
Is Seokcheol coming late today?

00:54:09.455 --> 00:54:11.915
He's on a trip. He texted me.

00:54:11.999 --> 00:54:13.876
What trip all of a sudden?

00:54:24.094 --> 00:54:25.387
Horrible wench.

00:54:53.248 --> 00:54:57.336
We're leaving in five minutes.
Go take care of your needs if you have to.

00:54:58.170 --> 00:55:01.256
- I'm going to the bathroom, sir.
- Okay, go on.

00:56:01.275 --> 00:56:04.111
MYOUNGSAN - JEONGSEON

00:56:12.661 --> 00:56:13.829
<i>Seokkyung,</i>

00:56:13.912 --> 00:56:17.332
<i>Hyeonggeun has been praying</i>
<i>that you'll come home</i>

00:56:17.416 --> 00:56:19.585
<i>when the lilac tree starts blooming.</i>

00:56:55.954 --> 00:56:59.791
It's said that
every star is the light of the past.

00:57:00.459 --> 00:57:02.628
Some are the lights from years ago.

00:57:02.711 --> 00:57:06.465
And some are the lights
from hundreds of years ago,

00:57:06.548 --> 00:57:07.924
traveling all the way here.

00:57:09.051 --> 00:57:12.054
Thus, the past and present are connected.

00:57:14.806 --> 00:57:16.141
I believed

00:57:16.725 --> 00:57:18.560
we'd meet again someday.

00:57:19.978 --> 00:57:22.564
I thought it'd be nice
to run into you on the street

00:57:23.231 --> 00:57:27.736
or pass you by in a moving car.

00:57:29.655 --> 00:57:33.325
And when I actually met you again,

00:57:33.408 --> 00:57:34.910
I was so happy

00:57:36.536 --> 00:57:38.038
that my wish came true.

00:57:42.876 --> 00:57:44.795
It wasn't just your wish.

00:57:45.837 --> 00:57:47.255
My prayer was answered too.

00:57:52.219 --> 00:57:55.013
Let's never part ways again,
no matter what happens.

00:57:56.765 --> 00:57:58.141
Let's never part ways again.

00:58:58.201 --> 00:58:59.911
Hyeonggeun!

00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:03.749
Hyeonggeun!

00:59:05.083 --> 00:59:06.835
Ms. Jo Maksoon!

00:59:10.338 --> 00:59:11.339
Mom?

00:59:12.048 --> 00:59:13.884
Mr. Park Silgon!

00:59:15.719 --> 00:59:17.053
Your foolish daughter

00:59:17.888 --> 00:59:19.806
is back home!

00:59:21.683 --> 00:59:22.684
Mom!

00:59:29.065 --> 00:59:30.609
Father!

00:59:31.276 --> 00:59:32.486
Mom!

00:59:33.445 --> 00:59:35.197
Hyeonggeun!

00:59:44.498 --> 00:59:46.583
Hyeonggeun!

00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:56.009


01:00:21.326 --> 01:00:22.494
The Nice Guy

01:00:23.078 --> 01:00:24.746

<i>Go in and beg him for forgiveness.</i>

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:25.831
Dad. Seokkyung.

01:00:25.914 --> 01:00:27.457
<i>Let him cuss you out</i>
<i>and beat you up.</i>

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:29.000
Father! No, Father!

01:00:29.084 --> 01:00:30.627
<i>Who took the order?</i>

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:32.671
<i>Seokcheol? Are you sure about this?</i>

01:00:33.255 --> 01:00:35.215
<i>Your father</i>
<i>wants to sell this house.</i>

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:38.718
<i>I borrowed some money</i>
<i>on this house as security.</i>

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:41.721
<i>You must be going through a lot.</i>

01:00:41.805 --> 01:00:42.848
Is it ready?

01:00:43.598 --> 01:00:44.766
<i>We can attack right now.</i>

01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:45.851
Begin.

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:57.696
<i>My son, Seokcheol,</i>
<i>said he'd quit.</i>

01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:00.323
<i>Let him go on a good note.</i>
