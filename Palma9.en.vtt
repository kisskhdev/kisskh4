mine

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.533
It's just that it's for someone else.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.333
They will think you are the same person.

00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.866
they won't hear my harsh words

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.500
because

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.333
i won't talk to them

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:34.600
if something happens

00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:35.533

Why are you so introverted?

00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:39.966
because they can catch my attention

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.733
you're the only person i talk to

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:44.566

00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.666

the previous mission

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.166
impossible to seduce drake palma

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.200
it seems to have been

00:02:33.466 --> 00:02:34.533
mission accomplished

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.733
Go home now.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.600
i think

00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:48.000
high school gave me a roller coaster of emotions

00:02:48.666 --> 00:02:50.533
Where are you, you ugly one?

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.300

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.100
and laughter

00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:00.566
but i'll try to fall

00:03:00.933 --> 00:03:01.800
while you're falling

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.866
and a whole lot of hearts

00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:04.866
palpitations

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:12.966
but like all things

00:03:13.733 --> 00:03:14.900
There is also an ending.

00:03:15.766 --> 00:03:17.066
my high school life

00:03:17.466 --> 00:03:18.266
ends here

00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:19.366
because

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:20.300
let's be real

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:21.366
not at all

00:03:21.366 --> 00:03:22.166

00:03:31.266 --> 00:03:34.000
Even though the cea in brentford is just walking distance

00:03:34.566 --> 00:03:35.200
I feel

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.066
cold

00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:37.066

00:03:37.966 --> 00:03:39.300

You didn't pass the SCA.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.400
That's how you behave.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.933

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:39.933
drake this

00:08:39.933 --> 00:08:40.733
drake that

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.766
Don't imitate your cousin Drake.

00:08:45.266 --> 00:08:46.066

00:08:59.566 --> 00:09:00.333

00:09:04.333 --> 00:09:06.100
I don't want business with Adad.

00:09:07.533 --> 00:09:09.533
You are really stubborn at all times, aren't you?

00:09:10.266 --> 00:09:11.966
why don't you imitate drake

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.000
You won't pass the sea anymore.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.100
like that

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:19.900
your habits

00:09:20.933 --> 00:09:22.333
Why are you like this?

00:09:22.933 --> 00:09:23.900
if you don't like me

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.066
Trade with Uncle Steve.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.066
It's a good thing I didn't pass the sea.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:30.900
for once

00:09:31.166 --> 00:09:31.966
i can force

00:09:32.066 --> 00:09:34.566
my way through life without being compared to my cousin

00:09:34.666 --> 00:09:35.466
good

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.766

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.166
without his shadow

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.533
It's just a shame I couldn't find a way to get the fine.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.500
arts like i wanted

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.566
but it's okay

00:09:47.466 --> 00:09:48.733
Let's give it to Pa first.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:49.500

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.300

00:10:27.766 --> 00:10:28.300

Oh, I'll send you your schedule, if you like.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.800

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.666
Hey, I'm sorry, don't be angry.

00:16:50.966 --> 00:16:53.200

Why do you know that?

00:19:08.066 --> 00:19:08.900
our old schoolmate

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.200

00:19:11.866 --> 00:19:12.666

00:19:12.666 --> 00:19:13.366
brentford

00:19:13.366 --> 00:19:14.700
Drake is also his classmate.

00:19:14.866 --> 00:19:16.733
until drake moved here to the sea

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:18.000

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:18.933

00:19:40.566 --> 00:19:42.200
I'm only in elementary school, so I know that, right?

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.066

00:19:46.533 --> 00:19:47.700

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:50.733

matured

00:22:00.133 --> 00:22:00.933
mysterious

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.333
I just thought so.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.866
you're still the same drake

00:22:08.966 --> 00:22:09.966
i knew back in

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:10.666
elementary

00:22:10.666 --> 00:22:11.466
and junior high

00:22:12.466 --> 00:22:13.266
and

00:22:14.766 --> 00:22:16.200
you still care about me

00:22:17.333 --> 00:22:18.866
what are you even talking about

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:20.700
well

00:22:21.133 --> 00:22:22.500
if you don't mind please

00:22:22.866 --> 00:22:25.066
I wish you had just left me at the clinic.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.000
but you still accompanied me

00:22:29.533 --> 00:22:31.266
you even offered your own car

00:22:31.366 --> 00:22:32.300
to take me home

00:22:33.533 --> 00:22:34.666
You still carried me.

00:22:37.133 --> 00:22:37.933
ah

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.933
Oh, it really hurts.

00:22:43.866 --> 00:22:44.666
hobby

00:22:44.933 --> 00:22:46.533

you take care

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.666
The mood swings are severe.

00:24:22.766 --> 00:24:23.566
that man

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.100
just met a friend

00:24:25.566 --> 00:24:26.366
done now

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:27.800
just walk a little

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:29.566

00:24:30.566 --> 00:24:31.200
freshman

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.600
It looks like he's probably walking around the whole school.

00:24:33.733 --> 00:24:34.533
grounds

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.300
Give up.

00:24:39.733 --> 00:24:40.533
because

00:24:41.133 --> 00:24:43.066
We've been walking without talking for a while now.

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.000
cooking

00:24:45.666 --> 00:24:46.466
I wish I was here.

00:24:46.466 --> 00:24:47.966
Aya, even if we walk for two hours

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.100
At least I'm talking to someone.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:52.600
departure

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:54.300
You are the only one here.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.900
Bentford, you can handle it.

00:25:02.766 --> 00:25:03.800
Why is it so ugly?

00:25:03.933 --> 00:25:04.733
your nose

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.266
We just met and you're already serious.

00:25:07.366 --> 00:25:08.166
be rude

00:25:20.333 --> 00:25:22.333
Wait, we're already left behind by the group.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.000
oh you

00:25:24.866 --> 00:25:26.166
Where are you going again?

00:25:30.066 --> 00:25:31.100
I am tired.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.666
Why are men like that?

00:25:40.266 --> 00:25:40.766
if not

00:25:40.766 --> 00:25:41.566

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:42.933

00:25:43.466 --> 00:25:45.333
Is it that hard to form a sentence?

00:25:46.533 --> 00:25:47.666
oh my gosh

00:25:48.066 --> 00:25:48.566
too much

00:25:48.566 --> 00:25:49.500
I am tired.

00:25:50.266 --> 00:25:51.400
Why not just a woman?

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.533
I became a partner.

00:25:52.966 --> 00:25:54.800
I hope my life is better now.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.200
Excuse me, please.

00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:58.900
Please buy a bottled water.

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.500
Have you ordered drinks yet?

00:26:04.066 --> 00:26:04.866

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.400

00:26:36.533 --> 00:26:37.333

Alice, what's up with you? I don't know them.

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:33.100
What's up with you?

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.866
I am embarrassed.

00:27:37.166 --> 00:27:37.966
departure

00:27:48.766 --> 00:27:49.666
What is that?

00:27:54.666 --> 00:27:55.566
Go home first.

00:27:55.933 --> 00:27:57.066
change your clothes

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.133
It's still early.

00:27:58.133 --> 00:28:00.166
We'll be here until afternoon, you might get sick.

00:28:03.733 --> 00:28:04.400

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.266

00:28:10.666 --> 00:28:12.100
mommy being bullied

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:12.866
I am here at

00:28:12.866 --> 00:28:13.666

00:28:14.666 --> 00:28:17.700
Please take back the decision to allow me to study here.

00:28:18.666 --> 00:28:19.200
I don't want to

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:19.900

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:33.733
I'm just going to buy some clothes.

00:28:38.533 --> 00:28:39.333

that's okay

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.933
You're a traveler looking like that.

00:28:54.166 --> 00:28:55.866
Why is there something wrong with my appearance?

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.400
You look like you fell into the sewer.

00:29:00.866 --> 00:29:01.666
also

00:29:07.366 --> 00:29:09.400
No one will hire a taxi for you like that.

00:29:09.533 --> 00:29:10.333
your appearance

00:29:11.266 --> 00:29:12.100
What?

00:29:12.266 --> 00:29:13.100
I should do

00:29:23.566 --> 00:29:25.100
Isn't that dangerous?

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.500
Well, it's fun.

00:29:28.466 --> 00:29:29.300

00:32:06.733 --> 00:32:07.600
Slow down.

00:34:58.666 --> 00:35:00.366
I won't ride your motorcycle anymore, okay?

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:01.966
You think you're the king of the road?

00:35:02.066 --> 00:35:02.900
if it shakes

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:04.300

You said that earlier too.

00:35:08.933 --> 00:35:09.900
This is art.

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:11.966
I'm sorry.

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.600
If only I loved my life, right?

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.933
Oh, you see, we got here because of my motorbike.

00:35:19.133 --> 00:35:19.666
whatever

00:35:19.666 --> 00:35:21.900
As long as I get a cab, at least I'm safe.

00:35:22.266 --> 00:35:22.900
oh wag

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:23.700

you are beautiful

00:35:24.766 --> 00:35:26.800
It's just you, it's just you if you're being rude.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.166
I don't want to say it.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:29.400

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:31.866

This school is already big enough, it's just not enough.

00:36:34.766 --> 00:36:36.133
They will take over the entire city.

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:41.133
Why don't I have that guy's number?

00:36:42.266 --> 00:36:43.000
I don't want to either.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.666
I'm the first to ask, right?

00:36:44.766 --> 00:36:45.566
Let's just be quiet.

00:36:45.566 --> 00:36:47.066
He should have been the one to ask me first.

00:36:53.866 --> 00:36:54.666

00:37:05.466 --> 00:37:06.266

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.200

You don't want to be sent to the states, do you?

00:38:04.966 --> 00:38:06.966
Well, Aya still texted like that.

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:10.666
Well, it's just the first day of school.

00:38:12.866 --> 00:38:14.333
It seems like he has no clue.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:15.766
that text

00:38:15.766 --> 00:38:17.466

you don't care

00:38:30.166 --> 00:38:30.966
It doesn't belong to you.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.100
This is the road.

business

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:10.900
administration is about

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:11.666
managing

00:39:11.666 --> 00:39:12.466
and organizing

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.066
different parts of a business

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:15.700

00:39:18.133 --> 00:39:20.566
They also discussed how they could grow

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:21.566
their business

00:39:22.166 --> 00:39:23.966

00:39:26.266 --> 00:39:27.066

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.366
my expectation for this subject

00:39:29.466 --> 00:39:31.066
is to learn how the economy works

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:31.966
from the basic

00:39:31.966 --> 00:39:32.766

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.866
supply and demand to major economic policies

00:39:36.066 --> 00:39:37.666
and of course i also want to understand

00:39:37.866 --> 00:39:38.500
how the

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:39.066
economy

00:39:39.066 --> 00:39:40.466

00:39:42.166 --> 00:39:42.966

00:39:48.166 --> 00:39:49.700
the fundamentals of business

00:39:50.533 --> 00:39:51.800

00:39:51.933 --> 00:39:52.566
overview

00:39:52.566 --> 00:39:54.166
of how companies are structured

00:39:54.666 --> 00:39:55.933
and how they function

00:39:57.166 --> 00:39:57.966

00:40:09.866 --> 00:40:10.500
wearable

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:11.300
piece of art

00:40:11.733 --> 00:40:12.766

00:40:13.066 --> 00:40:14.066
you will learn

00:40:14.266 --> 00:40:15.066
design

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.466
choose fabric

00:40:16.766 --> 00:40:18.966
and learn your own style

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.500
Do you know how to sew?

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:22.800

Do you want to see?

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.566

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:45.266
Make sure you are doing it right.

00:40:46.066 --> 00:40:47.766
and after this you have to clean

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:48.766
all your areas

00:40:52.666 --> 00:40:54.133

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:07.500

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.066
hello

00:41:12.066 --> 00:41:12.866
day mo

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.000
fine

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:15.766
Be careful with your answer.

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:18.700
we made dumplings

00:41:19.166 --> 00:41:19.966
That's my case.

00:41:20.166 --> 00:41:20.966
quite a bit

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:21.800
among

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:26.400
This is terrible.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.366
but you know it's okay even if it's blood, right?

00:41:30.466 --> 00:41:31.066
annoying

00:41:31.066 --> 00:41:31.866
the one next to me earlier

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:32.700
he told me

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:33.200
that's it

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.000
This is wrong.

00:41:34.133 --> 00:41:34.733
you know that

00:41:34.733 --> 00:41:35.533
he is worried

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:37.333
He was teaching me, he said this.

00:41:37.533 --> 00:41:38.166
like that like that
