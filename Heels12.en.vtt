WEBVTT

00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:20.539
She used it for the Human Amulet spell,

00:01:20.623 --> 00:01:22.750
so maybe I should say
it belongs to Gyeon-U.

00:01:25.127 --> 00:01:26.003
If that's the case,

00:01:26.921 --> 00:01:28.380
you should give it to Gyeon-U.

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:32.843
That way, we can reconnect

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:35.095
the ties that have been broken.

00:02:12.925 --> 00:02:14.552
They will meet at last.

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:25.479
Hey, if you were going to stay out,
you should've told me…

00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:34.196
Seong-A.

00:02:40.578 --> 00:02:42.955
Darn. That didn't work.

00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:46.041
I couldn't move over to Bae Gyeon-U,
so no wonder it didn't work on this one.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.502
Long time no see, you massive pushover.

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:53.841
Bong-su?

00:02:53.924 --> 00:02:55.467
Do you have a girlfriend now?

00:02:55.551 --> 00:02:57.636
Or you still have a crush on the shaman?

00:03:01.891 --> 00:03:02.766
You're hopeless.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.393
Hey, you…

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:05.561
Come here.

00:03:05.644 --> 00:03:07.938
Stop bullying him and come.
You need to get changed first.

00:03:08.022 --> 00:03:10.357
-Why? I'm comfortable right now.
-We're not. Come inside.

00:03:10.441 --> 00:03:11.859
-Come along.
-Hey.

00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:22.369
What? Am I excessively pretty?

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.999
How's this?

00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:29.668
Forget the clothes.
Why do you keep coming out with shoes on?

00:03:29.752 --> 00:03:30.628
It's fashion.

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:35.633
Smile.

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:37.176
Unless you want me to kill you.

00:03:41.972 --> 00:03:42.806
How about now?

00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:53.692
You look pretty.

00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:58.072
Hey, Ji-ho.
Your big brother's out on leave!

00:04:02.326 --> 00:04:03.285
Move that way.

00:04:04.453 --> 00:04:05.287
Goodness.

00:04:06.997 --> 00:04:08.207
No.

00:04:11.502 --> 00:04:12.544
What are you doing here?

00:04:12.628 --> 00:04:15.839
What do you mean?
I'm here because this is my home.

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:17.633
Right.

00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:21.387
-Why are you here?
-Hang on.

00:04:22.096 --> 00:04:24.390
-Where's Ji-ho?
-Hey.

00:04:24.473 --> 00:04:26.809
-What?
-Why are you looking for Ji-ho here?

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:29.228
-Can't I?
-You can't.

00:04:29.728 --> 00:04:31.689
Ji-ho must be at his place, why would he…

00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:32.606
Get going.

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:36.360
Do you have to be so unwelcoming?

00:04:36.902 --> 00:04:38.195
It's not like that…

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:39.446
Sorry.

00:04:40.239 --> 00:04:41.490
I'm off, then.

00:04:41.573 --> 00:04:42.533
Don't go!

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:44.618
-I like you.
-What?

00:04:47.955 --> 00:04:48.956
Get back inside.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.088
Gyeon-U.

00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:57.423
Someone's stealing my sweets.

00:05:00.718 --> 00:05:01.719
Park Seong-A?

00:05:02.845 --> 00:05:03.887
Hey!

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:07.307
-What?
-What?

00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:08.726
-Seong-A's back?
-Seong-A's back?

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:11.729
Your clothes are all…

00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:12.938
Oh, geez.

00:05:13.731 --> 00:05:15.733
This is slightly better
than the other ones.

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:19.570
Change into these two
and cover up with this, okay?

00:05:20.446 --> 00:05:22.072
Act like Seong-A. Understood?

00:05:22.156 --> 00:05:23.699
Oh, my gosh…

00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:28.662
I thought I'd seen a ghost.

00:05:29.538 --> 00:05:31.290
Sure, I get you.

00:05:32.541 --> 00:05:33.709
What?

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:34.793
Who's there?

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.546
Seong-A. Where is she?

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.298
How do you all know the passcode?

00:05:40.132 --> 00:05:41.216
-You--
-Gyeon-U.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.342
Where is Seong-A?

00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:46.305
In there.

00:05:48.432 --> 00:05:49.516
If she came back,

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.226
-you should've called.
-That hurts.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.895
-You…
-Why are you hitting me?

00:06:00.194 --> 00:06:01.195
Seong-A.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.498
Right, hi.

00:06:13.916 --> 00:06:15.459
But who are you?

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:19.505
I'm Do-yeon.

00:06:20.297 --> 00:06:21.131
Do…

00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:23.133
Ku Do-yeon?

00:06:25.511 --> 00:06:26.345
It can't be.

00:06:28.597 --> 00:06:29.598
You're too pretty.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.643
Dang, girl.

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:34.353
You're pretty.

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:52.704
Hey. Don't cry.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.999
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three.

00:06:56.542 --> 00:06:57.793
-Ta-da!
-Ta-da!

00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:01.797
Let's celebrate Seong-A's safe return!

00:07:02.381 --> 00:07:03.507
What the heck?

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:09.888
We should celebrate with a toast!

00:07:09.972 --> 00:07:11.431
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

00:07:11.515 --> 00:07:14.226
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:16.395
Seong-A. How have you been?

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:19.940
Where were you? In Korea? Abroad?

00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:21.984
-Yeah, what were you up to?
-Seriously.

00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:24.736
I'm curious too.
You never called once. How could you?

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:25.863
So mean.

00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:27.614
Sorry.

00:07:27.698 --> 00:07:30.075
I was busy being all over the place.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.704
I traveled a lot, and time flew.

00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:38.125
It must be nice
to feel like time flies by.

00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:39.042
Babe.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.546
I missed you so much I thought I'd die.

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:43.463
Me too.

00:07:44.298 --> 00:07:47.759
How about we go
on a long trip like Seong-A?

00:07:47.843 --> 00:07:49.136
-Shall we?
-Shall we?

00:07:50.846 --> 00:07:52.973
Jin-ung. Not before you're discharged.

00:07:54.183 --> 00:07:55.809
You haven't even enlisted yet.

00:07:55.893 --> 00:07:57.394
Why bring up the military?

00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:59.646
I can take care of myself,
thank you very much.

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:02.608
Guys. I have a crush on someone.

00:08:03.275 --> 00:08:05.694
Hey. Give up already.

00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:06.820
That hurts.

00:08:06.904 --> 00:08:08.322
You be quiet.

00:08:08.405 --> 00:08:09.239
Drink up.

00:08:09.323 --> 00:08:10.324
Me too!

00:08:10.407 --> 00:08:11.909
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

00:08:16.788 --> 00:08:18.332
-What the heck?
-That's beatboxing?

00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:21.293
-What was that?
-He's good when he makes an effort.

00:08:24.213 --> 00:08:25.464
That's insane.

00:08:32.638 --> 00:08:34.056
-Did you not know?
-I had no idea.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.974
What did you do to your hair?

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:41.063
-Me too.
-Yes, of course.

00:08:41.146 --> 00:08:42.397
-Which one?
-What do you want?

00:08:42.481 --> 00:08:44.608
-I want a chicken skewer.
-Good choice!

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:45.984
This needs to be grilled, though.

00:08:46.068 --> 00:08:47.486
We have tripe? Amazing.

00:08:52.241 --> 00:08:53.325
I wonder

00:08:54.076 --> 00:08:55.911
how everyone is doing.

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:12.052
I miss them.

00:09:21.478 --> 00:09:24.147
The person basking in this warmth

00:09:25.941 --> 00:09:27.484
should be Seong-A, not me.

00:09:29.695 --> 00:09:32.155
Since it came up, you should answer.

00:09:32.239 --> 00:09:33.073
Seong-A.

00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:34.908
I actually prepared something for today.

00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:42.374
I'm sorry.

00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:47.629
I'm sorry that I'm here.

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:00.809
It's okay, Seong-A. It's fine.

00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:04.354
Why are you apologizing?

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:09.109
You're back, so it's all good.
You don't have to cry.

00:10:10.027 --> 00:10:13.572
Hey, instead of crying,
how about we drink some more?

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:14.614
-Let's do that.
-Yeah.

00:10:14.698 --> 00:10:16.199
-It's a happy day.
-It is.

00:10:16.283 --> 00:10:18.452
-Hang on, guys.
-Cheers!

00:10:35.552 --> 00:10:37.763
So, where's Seong-A?

00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:43.435
What should I do to meet the real Seong-A?

00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:49.483
The Hour of the Ox.

00:10:52.235 --> 00:10:53.653
The hour of ghosts.

00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:10.379
Seong-A.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:12.798
Seong-A?

00:11:17.469 --> 00:11:18.637
Do you hear me?

00:11:20.222 --> 00:11:21.431
It's Gyeon-U.

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:39.074
Gyeon-U?

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:46.998
Seong-A.

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:49.626
Seong-A…

00:12:10.564 --> 00:12:11.690
"Seong-A."

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:14.526
"Do you hear me?"

00:12:14.609 --> 00:12:15.902
"It's Gyeon-U."

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:26.913
I'm sorry.

00:12:33.378 --> 00:12:34.588
Shoot!

00:12:37.466 --> 00:12:38.300
Damn it!

00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:41.261
What is it? What's wrong?

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:44.181
It's Bong-su. I wish I could just…

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:45.390
Darn it.

00:12:45.891 --> 00:12:47.767
He's the worst.
He tricked me with Seong-A…

00:12:51.855 --> 00:12:52.898
I'm so pissed.

00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:01.114
Hey.

00:13:04.201 --> 00:13:05.410
"Seong-A."

00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:08.788
"Do you hear me? It's Gyeon-U."

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:10.790
"Seong-A."

00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:16.254
You should know when to stop.
Gyeon-U's scary when he's angry.

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.507
So what if he's angry?

00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:23.220
I don't know anymore.

00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:27.098
If you don't know,

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:29.476
just stuff your face.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.394
Yummy, right?

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.403
Babe.

00:13:40.946 --> 00:13:41.947
You're home.

00:13:52.916 --> 00:13:56.920
Sweetie. Tell me how your day was.

00:13:58.129 --> 00:13:59.589
That was a low blow.

00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:07.472
Did you really think I was the shaman?

00:14:07.556 --> 00:14:10.934
I should've kept it going for longer.
Then you would've bawled your eyes out.

00:14:13.228 --> 00:14:14.271
Stop it. It's not fun--

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:17.065
Let's try again at the Hour of the Ox.
It might work then.

00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:19.526
I told you to stop it.

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:22.612
I don't want to.

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:27.534
Don't test my patience.

00:14:32.289 --> 00:14:33.957
What? What were you two doing?

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.000
Nothing.

00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:40.255
Bong-su's still a kid,
and you're an adult.

00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:41.631
So act like one.

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:47.345
He keeps on taunting me
with Seong-A of all things.

00:14:47.429 --> 00:14:49.055
You saw him cry too.

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:54.561
I'm sure there's a story
he can't share easily.

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:59.399
He's serious about Seong-A
as much as we are.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:02.444
That's it.

00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:04.529
Pull it up. Go on.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.243
Yes.

00:15:10.327 --> 00:15:11.494
I got it.

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:17.667
Console him.

00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:19.044
Give this to him and apologize.

00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:24.507
They're exactly the same.

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:27.260
Give him that one.

00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:31.306
I'm off

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:32.724
to apologize.

00:15:39.314 --> 00:15:40.732
You just wait.

00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:43.276
I'll get you lots of friends.

00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:55.080
Don't turn the lights on.

00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:09.803
So…

00:16:18.228 --> 00:16:19.604
I'm sorry about earlier.

00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:21.564
It was

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:24.484
not so grown-up of me.

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:39.999
Will you do me a favor?

00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:42.669
Okay.

00:16:43.962 --> 00:16:45.255
Die for me.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.510
Die in the shaman's place.

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:53.054
I'm begging you.

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:00.562
And how should I do that?

00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:12.532
Pretend to be me.

00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:16.619
She'll never come out
if she thinks you're you.

00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:44.731
Hey.

00:17:45.482 --> 00:17:46.357
Shaman.

00:17:47.609 --> 00:17:48.485
Come on out.

00:17:59.412 --> 00:18:01.080
I thought you were Gyeon-U.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.833
You startled me.

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:06.002
What if I'm Gyeon-U?

00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:09.964
Then I should hide, of course.

00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:11.758
Why?

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:14.302
Because I could harm him.

00:18:19.808 --> 00:18:20.642
Hey.

00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:24.145
Why are you so quiet today?

00:18:38.409 --> 00:18:39.327
Seong-A, wait.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.830
You shouldn't be around me.

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:44.123
Seong-A.

00:18:44.207 --> 00:18:46.084
Her spirit vessel is cracking.

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:48.628
I must leave her body quickly
for her to live.

00:18:48.711 --> 00:18:49.712
But…

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:54.342
I can't get out.

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:58.429
She won't let go of me.

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:03.059
I knew from the beginning

00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:07.397
that this wasn't my dream.

00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:09.649
I knew I was in your dream.

00:19:11.693 --> 00:19:14.404
Ji-ho was in Grade 12, Class 1.

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:15.905
I was in Class 2.

00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:17.282
We were in different classes.

00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:19.200
The space on top of our lockers

00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:20.869
was never that organized.

00:19:20.952 --> 00:19:23.246
It was always cluttered with workbooks.

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:24.372
And…

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:28.334
none of the Grade 12 classes
had any potted plants.

00:19:28.418 --> 00:19:29.544
They would've withered

00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:32.338
because everyone was
too busy with studies to water them.

00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:37.051
Shall I go on?

00:19:39.137 --> 00:19:40.013
Yeah.

00:19:40.805 --> 00:19:41.806
First of all…

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:45.518
Ji-ho.

00:19:46.603 --> 00:19:48.897
He always came to my class
to borrow textbooks.

00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:51.316
Hey, Gyeon-U, I have English.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.526
Huh? He's not here.

00:19:59.574 --> 00:20:00.909
Do-yeon and Jin-ung

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:03.411
got split into different classes.

00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:07.248
Jin-ung and his gang
would come to our classroom

00:20:07.332 --> 00:20:09.125
-to hang out with her.
-There's a ghost here?

00:20:10.168 --> 00:20:11.002
I don't see it.

00:20:11.085 --> 00:20:13.046
I really don't see it. Where is it?

00:20:14.297 --> 00:20:15.840
You don't see it?

00:20:17.008 --> 00:20:18.509
Hey, it's there.

00:20:19.093 --> 00:20:20.136
It's there. Look closely.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.057
Oh, as for Beom and Ju-seung…

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.558
JUNE MOCK EXAM SCORE CARD

00:20:25.642 --> 00:20:27.727
They were stressed
because of their grades.

00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:30.313
Hye-ri was there to lift their spirits.

00:20:30.396 --> 00:20:32.231
-Eat mine too.
-Okay.

00:20:32.315 --> 00:20:34.275
Eat my report card too, Beom.

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:38.488
You idiots.
You can always do better next time.

00:20:39.072 --> 00:20:40.823
I'll treat you to something nice today.

00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:42.283
For real?

00:20:43.117 --> 00:20:44.035
Let's do this.

00:20:45.912 --> 00:20:47.622
-Let's do it!
-Let's do it!

00:20:47.705 --> 00:20:50.208
They all did pretty well,
keeping themselves busy.

00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:52.585
I see.

00:20:53.503 --> 00:20:54.379
What about you?

00:20:57.006 --> 00:20:58.716
How have you been?

00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:05.264
I…

00:21:09.143 --> 00:21:10.228
YEONCHEON-GUN

00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:11.145
PATROL GHOSTS

00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:14.816
Well, it's been…

00:21:16.234 --> 00:21:18.236
I've been doing pretty well.

00:21:21.155 --> 00:21:22.156
That's a relief.

00:21:23.658 --> 00:21:24.492
And you?

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:30.915
How have you been?

00:21:33.876 --> 00:21:35.003
Well…

00:21:44.804 --> 00:21:47.098
Is it because Gyeon-U sat here?

00:21:48.141 --> 00:21:49.225
The seat's warm.

00:21:53.104 --> 00:21:54.564
This is good enough for me.

00:21:55.606 --> 00:21:58.026
Seeing him from time to time like this
is more than enough.

00:22:05.116 --> 00:22:06.576
It's been great.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.745
Really great.

00:22:15.043 --> 00:22:16.085
Seong-A.

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:26.512
I left you alone in our past.

00:22:28.556 --> 00:22:29.891
I'm so sorry.

00:23:07.345 --> 00:23:08.387
You're back.

00:23:13.559 --> 00:23:14.477
Where's Bong-su?

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.561
Bong-su?

00:23:17.313 --> 00:23:18.147
He's in here.

00:23:18.731 --> 00:23:19.565
What?

00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:21.317
No.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.820
He can't be in there. I need him back to…

00:23:23.903 --> 00:23:26.697
No, wait. You can't take him back.

00:23:26.781 --> 00:23:28.950
There's no going back.

00:23:29.033 --> 00:23:29.951
It's over.

00:23:30.034 --> 00:23:32.912
I worked so hard to get Bong-su back.
You can't take him from me.

00:23:41.671 --> 00:23:44.590
Come on, why the long face?
You don't have to worry.

00:23:44.674 --> 00:23:46.300
I have a plan.

00:23:48.177 --> 00:23:49.303
What plan?

00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:53.432
From now on,

00:23:54.684 --> 00:23:57.145
you just have to do three things.

00:23:58.146 --> 00:23:59.313
Sleep well,

00:23:59.397 --> 00:24:00.565
eat well,

00:24:00.648 --> 00:24:01.566
and smile often.

00:24:03.568 --> 00:24:06.737
Focus on those,
and I'll take care of the rest.

00:24:22.211 --> 00:24:23.546
Parents are always a handful.

00:24:24.547 --> 00:24:26.507
This place is the best.

00:24:35.641 --> 00:24:37.226
They're now this close?

00:24:38.686 --> 00:24:39.520
It's too much.

00:25:02.668 --> 00:25:03.669
It's Seong-A.

00:25:39.997 --> 00:25:40.873
Yes.

00:25:43.542 --> 00:25:45.002
GLASS NOODLES

00:25:56.722 --> 00:25:57.890
What are you doing, Seong-A?

00:25:57.974 --> 00:25:58.808
What?

00:25:59.934 --> 00:26:00.851
I was just…

00:26:01.852 --> 00:26:03.271
I don't think

00:26:04.397 --> 00:26:05.982
I can wear any of the clothes here.

00:26:06.899 --> 00:26:07.858
What on earth…

00:26:08.818 --> 00:26:10.987
Is this a bag or what?

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:12.571
Put that down.

00:26:12.655 --> 00:26:14.156
I'll throw them all away.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.533
I'll lend you my clothes.

00:26:16.325 --> 00:26:17.576
Is this some animal print?

00:26:20.788 --> 00:26:22.206
I can't wear this either.

00:26:34.176 --> 00:26:36.387
Hey, Ji-ho. Hi.

00:26:37.471 --> 00:26:38.597
Long time no see.

00:26:40.975 --> 00:26:42.018
It's me.

00:26:46.772 --> 00:26:47.648
I know that.

00:26:47.732 --> 00:26:50.067
I can tell by the footsteps.

00:26:54.405 --> 00:26:57.033
What's this? Did you make that japchae?

00:27:00.453 --> 00:27:01.287
Yeah.

00:27:12.965 --> 00:27:14.675
I eat this every day, and it's still good.

00:27:14.759 --> 00:27:16.677
You're an awesome cook.

00:27:16.761 --> 00:27:17.636
What the heck?

00:27:21.307 --> 00:27:22.433
You've got food all over you.

00:27:26.687 --> 00:27:27.813
Wait, it's still there.

00:27:32.777 --> 00:27:35.488
Go ahead and eat up.
You don't have to pass me the dishes.

00:27:42.328 --> 00:27:43.954
Guys. This is the best combination.

00:27:44.955 --> 00:27:46.707
-Hey, come on.
-What's that?

00:27:53.214 --> 00:27:55.091
What are you doing?
Are you going somewhere?

00:27:57.551 --> 00:27:58.386
Gyeon-U.

00:28:02.807 --> 00:28:04.058
Do you know what that sound is?

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:06.644
What sound is it?

00:28:17.738 --> 00:28:20.032
The sound of my first love ending.

00:28:26.831 --> 00:28:27.706
What?

00:28:28.249 --> 00:28:29.125
Hey.

00:28:31.043 --> 00:28:31.877
Hey.

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:02.575
It hurts.

00:29:25.931 --> 00:29:27.516
Isn't it too hot out?

00:29:28.058 --> 00:29:28.893
Shall we go indoors?

00:29:30.895 --> 00:29:31.896
It's okay.

00:30:54.353 --> 00:30:55.604
Don't look at her for too long.

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.856
It'll make leaving harder.

00:31:08.534 --> 00:31:10.244
She kept the evil deity inside her

00:31:11.161 --> 00:31:12.830
to the point it made her so weak.

00:31:15.499 --> 00:31:17.042
She's a tough one.

00:31:18.377 --> 00:31:20.212
She's going to recover, right?

00:31:21.463 --> 00:31:23.465
Shamanistic practice's
all about equivalent exchange.

00:31:23.549 --> 00:31:25.759
When one life withers,

00:31:27.386 --> 00:31:29.054
another blooms.

00:31:33.225 --> 00:31:35.603
I met him. I couldn't run away.

00:31:36.228 --> 00:31:37.896
More like you chose not to run away.

00:31:40.733 --> 00:31:42.901
So, did you let him into your body?

00:31:43.402 --> 00:31:44.528
The evil deity, I mean.

00:31:44.612 --> 00:31:45.571
Yes.

00:31:49.074 --> 00:31:51.035
You can save Seong-A, right?

00:31:53.621 --> 00:31:55.289
For that to happen, you must die.

00:31:56.832 --> 00:31:58.459
Yeah, I know that.

00:31:59.126 --> 00:32:00.794
Please, I've spent years around you.

00:32:27.363 --> 00:32:28.197
TO HEAVEN AND EARTH FAIRY

00:32:35.037 --> 00:32:35.996
It's done.

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:37.665
Shall we, then?

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:10.823
We're here.

00:33:10.906 --> 00:33:13.534
We have to walk from here.

00:33:20.749 --> 00:33:21.709
Aren't you curious

00:33:23.544 --> 00:33:25.212
if there's a way

00:33:26.505 --> 00:33:28.006
other than you dying?

00:33:31.844 --> 00:33:34.555
Seong-A kept trying
to find that other way, didn't she?

00:33:35.222 --> 00:33:36.765
But she failed.

00:33:46.483 --> 00:33:47.443
Have I

00:33:48.152 --> 00:33:50.237
ever apologized to you?

00:33:57.453 --> 00:33:58.287
No.

00:34:05.461 --> 00:34:07.337
I'll help you cross over without pain.

00:34:53.258 --> 00:34:54.384
You know,

00:34:55.135 --> 00:34:57.387
it's not fair
that I'm the only one to die.

00:34:58.514 --> 00:35:00.516
Shouldn't you die as well?

00:35:03.393 --> 00:35:04.311
What makes you think

00:35:05.062 --> 00:35:06.438
you're the only one to die?

00:35:10.651 --> 00:35:11.735
Yeomhwa!

00:35:13.445 --> 00:35:14.613
Where are you? Show yourself!

00:35:15.447 --> 00:35:18.534
Flower Master. Why the surprise visit?

00:35:18.617 --> 00:35:19.576
Where is Yeomhwa?

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:21.954
I don't know. I haven't seen her all day.

00:35:22.538 --> 00:35:26.166
She wired 100 million won to my account
and has been ignoring my calls all day.

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:27.584
Hang on.

00:35:30.671 --> 00:35:31.713
Master.

00:35:32.214 --> 00:35:33.799
She wired me the same amount too.

00:35:33.882 --> 00:35:34.842
YEOMHWA, 100,000,000 WON

00:35:36.593 --> 00:35:39.221
So you will die too?

00:35:39.304 --> 00:35:42.266
Yes, exorcising an evil deity
isn't an easy job.

00:35:42.891 --> 00:35:44.101
Aren't you afraid?

00:35:45.394 --> 00:35:46.645
You're about to die.

00:35:47.479 --> 00:35:48.856
All my life,

00:35:49.606 --> 00:35:50.941
I've been afraid of living.

00:35:52.234 --> 00:35:54.152
Death doesn't particularly scare me.

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:01.368
Are you afraid?

00:36:05.247 --> 00:36:06.081
I'll…

00:36:08.333 --> 00:36:09.334
go to hell, won't I?

00:36:20.512 --> 00:36:21.346
Don't worry.

00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:25.475
You won't be alone.

00:36:31.189 --> 00:36:32.649
You crazy witch! Open up!

00:36:33.901 --> 00:36:35.068
Yeomhwa!

00:36:35.152 --> 00:36:37.696
Do you hear me? Open the doors!

00:36:37.779 --> 00:36:39.781
This isn't right.
You can't do this, Yeomhwa!

00:36:40.365 --> 00:36:42.701
Yeomhwa. It's still not too late.
Open the doors.

00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:44.036
Oh, dear.

00:36:44.119 --> 00:36:47.164
-Yeomhwa, open up!
-We have an unwanted guest.

00:36:49.583 --> 00:36:50.918
Why worry?

00:36:52.169 --> 00:36:53.503
You've got…

00:36:54.546 --> 00:36:55.547
an evil deity on your side.

00:37:05.515 --> 00:37:06.516
Yeomhwa…

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:24.952
It's impossible.

00:37:25.661 --> 00:37:28.038
We're no match for him.

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:37.881
Let's still do it.

00:37:57.859 --> 00:38:00.737
It feels like
I forgot something important.

00:38:03.573 --> 00:38:04.783
What is it?

00:39:46.802 --> 00:39:48.011
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

00:39:55.852 --> 00:39:56.770
Hang on.

00:39:57.771 --> 00:39:58.730
That kid…

00:40:01.066 --> 00:40:04.027
That's right.
I'll go to a four-year college for sure.

00:40:04.111 --> 00:40:06.238
I'll stay and study for a long, long time.

00:40:06.321 --> 00:40:07.739
Which field? Which major?

00:40:07.823 --> 00:40:09.366
What's your plan after college?

00:40:11.243 --> 00:40:13.286
I sure have plans for after college.

00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:14.788
First of all…

00:40:14.871 --> 00:40:16.373
What do I want to do?

00:40:16.456 --> 00:40:17.791
There must be no plan

00:40:17.874 --> 00:40:20.001
because you'll continue
to be a shaman anyway.

00:40:20.085 --> 00:40:21.378
Not many can wield two swords.

00:40:21.962 --> 00:40:24.297
Who throws away their sharpened sword
to pick up a rusty one?

00:40:27.092 --> 00:40:29.886
Right. I'm a shaman.

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:38.270
What am I doing here right now?

00:41:12.095 --> 00:41:13.513
Heaven and Earth Fairy,

00:41:15.056 --> 00:41:16.308
by the time you wake up,

00:41:17.475 --> 00:41:19.102
it will all be over.

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:24.816
I was concerned
you might resort to risking your life

00:41:25.859 --> 00:41:28.612
when you're totally powerless
without your patron deity.

00:41:29.696 --> 00:41:30.697
I hope you'll understand.

00:41:34.034 --> 00:41:35.035
When you wake up,

00:41:35.827 --> 00:41:37.120
you will be heartbroken.

00:41:39.414 --> 00:41:40.790
But remember this one thing.

00:41:42.334 --> 00:41:43.835
Gyeon-U left you to save you

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.171
because he loves you.

00:41:48.048 --> 00:41:49.382
That will help you live on.

00:41:51.343 --> 00:41:52.677
Just like how I could go on

00:41:53.345 --> 00:41:54.763
even after our mother passed.

00:41:58.141 --> 00:41:59.392
Fairy God.

00:42:02.145 --> 00:42:03.396
Come on down.

00:42:06.858 --> 00:42:08.610
Come back to me.

00:42:27.254 --> 00:42:28.255
I can

00:42:28.338 --> 00:42:29.673
protect them.

00:42:31.007 --> 00:42:32.968
I can still do it.

00:42:33.885 --> 00:42:35.595
I can do it.

00:42:38.306 --> 00:42:39.975
Please…

00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:44.688
I can really do it.

00:42:45.522 --> 00:42:48.275
I know I still got it.

00:42:49.067 --> 00:42:49.943
So…

00:42:52.028 --> 00:42:53.655
So please…

00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:59.119
Please allow me one more chance…

00:43:02.747 --> 00:43:04.916
to share your power.

00:43:08.128 --> 00:43:09.337
Please…

00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:15.010
Please.

00:43:21.641 --> 00:43:22.475
Hey.

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:25.895
Is this meant to be this hard?

00:43:25.979 --> 00:43:27.063
We've done

00:43:28.732 --> 00:43:30.692
too much evil to deserve an easy death.

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:32.986
Don't worry.

00:43:35.488 --> 00:43:36.990
We're nearly there.

00:43:55.425 --> 00:43:56.301
Again!

00:44:07.395 --> 00:44:08.396
Please.

00:44:17.489 --> 00:44:19.032
You can't kill me with that.

00:44:20.742 --> 00:44:22.452
This place isn't real anyway.

00:44:23.036 --> 00:44:25.372
It's all an illusion. Am I wrong?

00:44:27.332 --> 00:44:29.918
Do you know this guy's name?

00:46:06.222 --> 00:46:08.057
Yeomhwa. Please.

00:46:10.602 --> 00:46:13.771
Yeomhwa, come outside. Yeomhwa.

00:46:17.734 --> 00:46:19.486
Yeomhwa!

00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:22.489
My dear friend! Yeomhwa!

00:46:24.741 --> 00:46:25.783
Master.

00:46:26.326 --> 00:46:27.368
Flower Master.

00:46:27.869 --> 00:46:29.162
Look over there!

00:46:36.127 --> 00:46:36.961
General?

00:46:39.005 --> 00:46:43.176
What took you so long, General?
You took your sweet time!

00:46:48.181 --> 00:46:49.307
It's Lady Fairy.

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:50.308
No.

00:46:50.892 --> 00:46:51.976
Over there.

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:54.687
General Dongcheon's there too.
What took you so long?

00:46:54.771 --> 00:46:56.898
You should've come sooner.

00:46:56.981 --> 00:46:58.816
Seriously, couldn't you have come sooner?

00:47:06.199 --> 00:47:07.033
Okay.

00:47:07.867 --> 00:47:09.827
We're all busy, so let's make it quick.

00:47:47.323 --> 00:47:48.741
Let's go, Yeomhwa.

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:08.219
Bong-su.

00:48:09.345 --> 00:48:12.515
It's not over yet.
All we need is your real name.

00:48:12.599 --> 00:48:14.142
Then we can turn everything back.

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:17.186
Do you know his name?

00:48:18.771 --> 00:48:19.814
Who is this guy?

00:48:21.316 --> 00:48:22.150
His name.

00:48:23.818 --> 00:48:24.652
What is it?

00:48:32.493 --> 00:48:33.703
You were all alone.

00:48:35.079 --> 00:48:36.205
It must've been scary.

00:48:49.886 --> 00:48:51.012
Mom.

00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:55.350
You couldn't ask anyone
to return your mother's ring.

00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:58.978
There was no one.

00:49:01.105 --> 00:49:03.900
That's why you came to imagine
there was a friend in your final moments.

00:49:06.819 --> 00:49:07.654
Hey.

00:49:09.989 --> 00:49:12.742
You believed he was real.

00:49:14.952 --> 00:49:17.872
You must've been so lonely.

00:49:24.545 --> 00:49:26.047
I'm real.

00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:29.133
My name is Bae Gyeon-U.

00:49:29.801 --> 00:49:32.720
Your name isn't Bong-su.

00:49:43.356 --> 00:49:45.149
-Jang Yoon-bo.
-Jang Yoon-bo.

00:49:50.947 --> 00:49:52.824
There was a reason I couldn't find it.

00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:55.493
One can't find something

00:49:56.744 --> 00:49:57.954
they've already found.

00:50:02.834 --> 00:50:04.460
"Yoon" means "sunshine."

00:50:07.505 --> 00:50:08.881
"Bo" means "wide."

00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:12.760
"Warm sunshine that reaches far and wide."

00:50:17.598 --> 00:50:19.726
It's a lovely name.

00:50:25.523 --> 00:50:27.984
YOUNG SOULS OF HWAMOK!
REST IN PEACE

00:50:28.067 --> 00:50:31.529
JANG YOON-BO

00:50:45.168 --> 00:50:46.461
Let's begin.

00:51:27.668 --> 00:51:30.046
I'm an evil jerk anyway,

00:51:30.129 --> 00:51:31.798
so though I know it's shameless to ask,

00:51:33.007 --> 00:51:34.842
can you grant me one last wish?

00:51:49.857 --> 00:51:50.942
I really wanted to

00:51:52.276 --> 00:51:54.821
hug you tight just once.

00:51:57.990 --> 00:52:01.869
Watching you carry all the weight
on your tiny shoulders

00:52:03.746 --> 00:52:04.831
made me want to

00:52:05.706 --> 00:52:06.916
comfort you at least once.

00:52:10.461 --> 00:52:11.671
There.

00:52:16.634 --> 00:52:17.510
Shaman.

00:52:18.803 --> 00:52:19.887
Goodbye.

00:52:24.183 --> 00:52:25.226
Take care.

00:52:28.521 --> 00:52:29.856
Come on now.

00:52:31.274 --> 00:52:32.692
You should say goodbye too.

00:52:44.328 --> 00:52:45.621
Goodbye.

00:53:12.315 --> 00:53:13.441
Seong-A.

00:54:44.365 --> 00:54:45.199
What?

00:54:46.117 --> 00:54:47.034
Your name.

00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:48.911
What is it?

00:54:49.537 --> 00:54:50.871
Not Yeomhwa.

00:54:51.497 --> 00:54:53.165
Your other name, the real one.

00:54:56.711 --> 00:54:58.504
Why do you want to know my name?

00:55:00.423 --> 00:55:01.257
Just because.

00:55:02.174 --> 00:55:05.011
It'd be nice to call you
by your actual name.

00:55:25.948 --> 00:55:26.824
See?

00:55:28.284 --> 00:55:30.161
Your body knows when you hate someone.

00:55:32.246 --> 00:55:33.581
Don't try too hard.

00:55:33.664 --> 00:55:35.291
Don't force yourself to forgive me.

00:55:36.876 --> 00:55:38.044
Take care.

00:56:05.362 --> 00:56:07.031
Aim for gold and shoot toward your dream.

00:56:07.114 --> 00:56:10.534
It's the second round of trials
for the 2028 Archery National Team.

00:56:10.618 --> 00:56:12.953
It's the last day already.

00:56:13.037 --> 00:56:16.874
Today, three male and three female
recurve archers will be selected

00:56:16.957 --> 00:56:20.503
to represent the Republic of Korea
in the 2028 LA Olympic Games.

00:56:21.253 --> 00:56:23.714
This is the final challenge
to compete in the Olympics.

00:56:23.798 --> 00:56:28.219
They say joining the Korean National Team
is harder than competing in the Olympics.

00:56:28.302 --> 00:56:29.720
The fierce competition will begin soon.

00:56:32.389 --> 00:56:34.850
The competition will start in 30 minutes.

00:56:35.518 --> 00:56:36.519
He's looking good.

00:56:38.813 --> 00:56:40.147
Beom, how did you two meet?

00:56:40.856 --> 00:56:42.191
We met…

00:56:42.274 --> 00:56:43.484
In the climbing club.

00:56:46.737 --> 00:56:49.824
It's about to start.
Why isn't Seong-A here yet?

00:57:01.627 --> 00:57:04.213
Village Chief, you won't have
headaches anymore.

00:57:06.132 --> 00:57:07.758
Thank you, Lady Fairy.

00:57:07.842 --> 00:57:09.552
I dreamed of being ordinary.

00:57:11.846 --> 00:57:13.764
Kang Gyeong-min, ten.

00:57:15.683 --> 00:57:16.934
Bae Gyeon-U, also ten.

00:57:18.227 --> 00:57:20.146
Hi. I'm almost there.

00:57:33.701 --> 00:57:34.577
I see

00:57:35.077 --> 00:57:37.413
more than others can.

00:57:49.091 --> 00:57:50.426
That has kept me

00:57:50.509 --> 00:57:52.803
hovering on the outskirts of the world.

00:57:53.554 --> 00:57:54.972
It doesn't upset me anymore.

00:57:58.976 --> 00:58:00.019
It's okay to cry in secret.

00:58:01.312 --> 00:58:03.105
I promise I'll find you.

00:58:04.899 --> 00:58:06.150
I'll be there with you.

00:58:07.234 --> 00:58:11.906
2ND ROUND
OF KOREAN ARCHERY NATIONAL TEAM TRIAL

00:58:12.489 --> 00:58:14.074
Kang Gyeong-min, ten!

00:58:15.367 --> 00:58:16.535
Gyeong-min shot a ten.

00:58:17.536 --> 00:58:18.412
Oh, my gosh.

00:58:18.996 --> 00:58:20.247
Do-yeon, I'm too nervous to watch.

00:58:33.177 --> 00:58:34.261
What are you doing here?

00:58:36.305 --> 00:58:38.098
Crying alone.

00:58:38.182 --> 00:58:39.183
You've been crying?

00:58:39.767 --> 00:58:40.643
Over there.

00:59:23.811 --> 00:59:25.062
Bye.

00:59:35.531 --> 00:59:37.366
He stopped crying?

00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:38.784
Yeah.

00:59:38.867 --> 00:59:40.619
He wiped his tears and marched off.

00:59:41.704 --> 00:59:42.746
Oh, right.

00:59:42.830 --> 00:59:44.665
How did the trials for the Olympics go?

00:59:54.883 --> 00:59:56.218
X. It's a ten!

00:59:56.302 --> 00:59:58.721
The last ticket to the next Olympic Games
for the male recurve team

00:59:58.804 --> 01:00:00.264
goes to Bae Gyeon-U!

01:00:12.526 --> 01:00:13.861
Hey, Gyeon-U!

01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:15.195
High-five.

01:00:23.871 --> 01:00:25.664
Hey, what was that?

01:00:25.748 --> 01:00:27.041
Come here.

01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:39.470
Well done.

01:00:40.721 --> 01:00:41.764
Thank you.

01:01:40.406 --> 01:01:41.240
Hello.

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:43.617
Word on the street says you're good.

01:02:16.817 --> 01:02:18.068
Ma'am.

01:02:19.611 --> 01:02:20.737
Hold him down, please.

01:02:24.575 --> 01:02:26.618
Me? Why would you hold me down?

01:02:28.328 --> 01:02:29.413
Don't you remember me?

01:02:34.418 --> 01:02:36.128
I'm sorry. I'm short on time here.

01:02:36.211 --> 01:02:38.046
If you don't go within ten minutes,

01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:39.548
I must give up on you.

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:42.468
You're that midterm exam kid, dammit!

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:47.848
I see you've gotten quite strong.

01:02:54.146 --> 01:02:56.982
You must've had a great time,
running about in the world

01:02:57.065 --> 01:02:59.026
in a living person's body.

01:03:17.294 --> 01:03:20.214
It's time to cross over.

01:03:21.465 --> 01:03:22.674
Go on.

01:03:23.258 --> 01:03:24.676
Let's move on.

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:25.761
No.

01:03:25.844 --> 01:03:26.887
No.

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:28.388
No!

01:03:28.889 --> 01:03:30.474
No!

01:03:30.557 --> 01:03:31.934
That hurts!

01:03:32.017 --> 01:03:33.519
It must hurt a lot.

01:03:36.855 --> 01:03:38.524
I'll help you stop hurting.

01:03:55.499 --> 01:03:56.458
It's time

01:03:57.501 --> 01:03:59.127
to fly far, far away.

01:04:19.231 --> 01:04:21.984
Oh, my gosh.

01:04:24.319 --> 01:04:25.821
That was a tough one.

01:04:26.655 --> 01:04:29.408
Who's next? Come in.

01:04:47.301 --> 01:04:49.303
