[Episode 7 – What's Mine Is Mine]

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:06.630
Let go, what are you doing?

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.080
Cha.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.580
Cha, what's wrong?

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.210
Cha.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.880
Cha.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.120
Cha, what's wrong?

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.229
Zefang.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.400
Xia Zefang.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:44.560
Cha.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.110
Are you alright?

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.580
Are you okay?

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.500
You're not hurt anywhere else, are you?

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.140
You're the one who's hurt.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.250
Do you have a death wish?

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.890
Didn't I tell you last time,

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.419
if there's danger, you run,

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.190
not throw yourself in the way?

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.030
Stop nagging.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.070
I'm scared of pain too, you know.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.340
But just now,

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.340
I saw you were in danger.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.750
Have you ever thought,

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.810
if something happened
to you because of me,

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.900
how would I feel?

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.770
No open wounds,

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.710
probably just bruising.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.800
This is the same spot

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.970
I injured when I fell down the stairs.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.560
So much bad luck.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.710
Let's go back to the dorm first.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.860
You okay?

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.860
Haru said we should just rest tonight.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.950
If you're still dizzy later,

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.350
we'll go to the hospital.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.340
But

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.590
I can't sleep outside.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.280
Then what will make you sleep?

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.880
Maybe… let me borrow a hug.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.220
Why would hugging me make you sleep?

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.390
Maybe because,

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.930
when I woke up in Zefang's body,

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.320
you were the first person to hug me.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.770
Hold on.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.810
I was kidding.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.670
You're really letting me hug you?

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:20.390
Go to sleep.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.260
Two grown men hugging like this,

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.700
what would people think?

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.170
"If I hadn't met you,

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.040
where would I be now?"

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.480
Still can't sleep?

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.490
No one's ever treated me like this before.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.070
And I've never treated
anyone this way either.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.610
So…

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.150
Mutual firsts.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.350
That body is mine.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.590
Mine.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.460
Why does everyone treat Grandpa so well?

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:46.800
You okay?

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:50.510
I'm fine, I'm fine.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.150
Luckily it hit Zefang's head both times.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.030
If it had been mine…

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:59.560
Are you alright?

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.360
Let's go.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.970
So Xia Zefang was helping Ye Haiyuan up.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:15.750
Whoa.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:16.680
Spicy news.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.260
Then Guan Riqing just got pushed aside.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.500
You know Xia Zefang?

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.570
I know, I know.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.940
Lately he's been
with one guy and one girl,

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.780
and in the middle of the night
you hear those sounds…

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.850
you know what I mean.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:30.880
Let me tell you a secret.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.450
You know how disgusting Xia Zefang is?

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.850
What happened?

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.150
He flirts with
a different person every day.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.120
No way.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.290
You know how outrageous Xia Zefang is?

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:38.350
He's seeing one guy

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.950
and one girl at the same time.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:02.380
[I'll go sort out the professor's files.
You be good and rest today.]

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:16.590
Go to sleep.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.670
Don't move.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.380
Why's my heart beating so fast?

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.830
Is there something wrong
with Zefang's heart?

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.330
Or does he like Haiyuan that much,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
his heart's still racing even here?

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.340
No way.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.210
I'm Xia Cha, a real man.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.230
No way I'd like another guy.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.880
And he's so much younger.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.640
If people knew,
they'd laugh their heads off.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.460
But right now I'm all alone,

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.030
who's there to laugh at me?

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.409
What are you doing?

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:43.450
Can you ask Qiansui to come out?

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.180
Why not just call him yourself?

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.380
I want to celebrate his birthday for him.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.110
Why can't he know?

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.020
He doesn't like people
celebrating his birthday.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.980
But if I don't, he'll be upset.

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:57.660
Why are you so good to him?

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:03.870
Must be fate.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.270
Could it be that you and Qiansui

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:09.840
are connected by the red thread too?

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.540
Red thread?

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.270
Yeah.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.580
Last time I took him to pray to
the Matchmaking God for the red thread,

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.440
he got mad and told me to go myself.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.340
I didn't dare go alone.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:24.920
I'm telling you,

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:25.590
later,

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:27.390
just bring Qiansui out later.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.790
I'll prepare a gift for him.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.030
You follow along behind.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.560
Then I'll surprise him from the back.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.230
Cha, what are you up to this time?

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.570
You're unbelievable.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.740
Pork knuckle noodles.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.250
Happy birthday.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.530
Who eats pork knuckle noodles
for a birthday?

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:55.990
That's so old-fashioned.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.450
Because…

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.070
I wish you a long,

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.590
healthy life.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.930
I only just found out it's your birthday.

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:07.760
It's a last-minute thing, but…

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:09.130
Happy birthday!

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.670
Happy birthday!

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.020
Thanks. Next time I'll throw you a party.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.870
No need.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.770
I'm not used to birthdays.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.680
And I've never had
someone to celebrate with.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.780
Aren't we enough?

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:25.810
Enough, enough, enough.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.180
Come on, eat.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.780
Bailing made these noodles.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:30.220
Here.

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:31.440
Here.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.120
If I eat it now,
my tongue will get burned.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.820
He's still smiling like that.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.080
So annoying to watch.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.370
Ever since Xia Zefang
came back from leave,

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:45.870
he's been kind to everyone

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.240
but you.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.570
Maybe I've been too pushy with him,

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.170
backfired on me.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.120
Look at Xia Zefang being a total flirt.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.980
Two men under his control at once,
and he still wants more.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:58.710
Now

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.250
he's trying to get between
Qiansui and Bailing too.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.050
What nonsense are you spouting?

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.030
You're here too?

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.290
What, gonna punch a classmate

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.470
to vent like before?

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.330
I'm telling you,

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:11.460
it won't help.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.140
He's already sleeping
in someone else's bed.

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:17.430
The whole dorm knows

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:18.830
you got dumped,

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.890
and Xia Zefang's with Ye Haiyuan now.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:23.510
Watch your mouth.

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.540
Funny, since when
did you start respecting people?

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:26.640
Apologize to Xia Zefang.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.040
Why would I
apologize to someone like that?

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.370
You dare say that again?

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:30.900
Stop fighting.

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:35.450
He treats you
like that and you can stand it?

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.490
The innocent stay innocent.

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:39.420
No need to care about what they say.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:42.350
You've really changed.

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.170
Before, if this happened,

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.910
you'd tell me to beat him up for you.

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:49.830
Stop using your fists to solve everything.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.200
You sound like an old man lecturing me.

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:57.370
Must've scrambled my brains.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:00.710
Guan Riqing.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:02.880
What are you doing?

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.150
Stay away from Cha.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:05.670
None of your business.

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:07.070
Haiyuan, don't misunderstand.

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:08.250
Guan Riqing didn't do anything to me.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.390
Calm down!

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:12.460
Oh no.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:13.480
So awkward.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.130
Just let me burn to death.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.290
Cha, Cha.

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:19.330
Where are you hurt?

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.100
My butt. My butt's burning hot.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.100
You guys are too much.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:26.060
Guan Riqing,

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.000
if you really like Xia Zefang,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.800
you shouldn't keep hurting him.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:31.210
And you, Ye Haiyuan,

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:32.230
you're just as childish.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:33.910
Someone throws shade
at you and you just start a fight?

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:35.640
And you dragged Cha into it too.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:40.480
Hurry up and take him
to the room, see if he's okay.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.590
Whatever's between them
isn't your business.

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:48.290
Leave.

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:58.470
What's wrong?

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:00.380
Since this morning,

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.560
I've only had one bite of noodles.

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:06.340
So you're just hungry, huh.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.740
What are you laughing at?

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.910
You went out of your way
to buy those noodles.

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:11.570
And now my birthday's ruined.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.520
I thought you didn't
like celebrating birthdays.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.050
Come on, I'll take you out
for something good.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:20.520
Ow, hot.

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:24.690
Fan it, quick.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:27.360
Feels like I'm on fire.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.490
Ah, that's better.

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:35.740
Didn't I tell you to stop running around?

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.270
First you get hit in the head,

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:38.870
now your butt joined the fun.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.810
Lie down.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:47.710
Who knew

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.750
you're actually good
at taking care of people?

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.920
Take back that

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.860
"who knew."

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.760
Whoever's with you

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.060
must be really happy.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.230
You really think so?

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.340
I think Zefang has great taste,

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.770
choosing you.

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:11.330
I don't care what Xia Zefang

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:12.680
thinks of me.

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:17.000
I was just thinking,

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.080
if you'd accepted Zefang from the start,

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.690
everything would've been different.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:24.480
What do you mean?

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.590
If Zefang had gotten
his wish and been with you,

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.060
he would've cut ties with Guan Riqing,

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.240
and wouldn't have fought
with me or fallen down the stairs.

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:36.630
Everything would've been perfect.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:41.490
Then you wouldn't be here.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:42.710
Perfect where?

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:45.610
I was already

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.480
a step away from the coffin.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:50.350
Now I'm just living in Zefang's place.

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:55.320
But I like that it's different now.

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:06.320
Listen to me.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.700
Even if it's the same face,

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:10.630
Xia Zefang and Xia Cha

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:12.760
are two completely different people.

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:15.240
He's him, you're you.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.470
Looking alike

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:19.440
doesn't mean you feel the same way.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:20.880
Understand?

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:30.220
It's because it's you

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.920
that I'm like this.

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:39.360
Forget it, never mind.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:44.100
Stop running around.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:46.800
I'll bring you food when I get back.

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:00.120
Why say this kind of stuff

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.320
when my butt is burnt?

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:33.050
It's because it's you

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.180
that I'm like this.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.380
Back when Yu Chan ran away from home
to be with me,

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.730
she said the same thing.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.630
Why does looking into Haiyuan's eyes,

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.230
and seeing that little mole,

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:52.870
make me dizzy every time?

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:00.480
What kind of bond

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.010
do I have with Haiyuan?

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.859
Weird.

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:16.720
Why are the cicadas so loud this year?

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:28.200
I'm leaving.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.070
Thanks, bye.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:29.890
Bye.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:52.540
Someone's lovesick.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.060
Didn't he say

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.840
they're just classmates?

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.710
No way.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.540
He's been sighing over there all night.

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:04.360
Must've had a fight.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:05.540
A fight?

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:06.740
Yeah.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:09.380
Couples always have little spats.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:10.620
Adds spice to love.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.520
We're not like that.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:19.690
Then what are you?

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.960
Hard to explain.

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:23.490
Then explain more.

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:25.990
It's complicated.

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:27.590
That's okay.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.230
We've got plenty of time.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.810
Guests will be here later.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.440
Turn off the lights, let's close early.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.670
Sis,

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.550
business was bad today,

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.120
so you want some gossip instead?

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.930
Told you he's in love,

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.210
won't admit it though.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:45.310
I'm not.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.590
Ye,

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:50.050
let me tell you something.

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:52.800
Men in love talk more.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.160
Haven't you noticed?

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.070
Every time we mention Xia,

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.440
you chime in,

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.130
even your voice gets softer.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:02.630
You're so different around Xia Cha.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:04.400
You smile, you care,

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.400
you're not cold anymore.

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:07.940
I'm not.

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:09.540
Oh really?

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.910
Your eyes never leave him.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.880
Fine, I won't push.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.280
Say it when you're ready.

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.050
If you have something
on your mind, say it.

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:22.150
Don't hold it in.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:24.480
Hold it in too long
and it'll eat you alive.

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:25.590
We're here for you.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.010
What, you wanna play with bubbles?

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.010
Childish.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:49.180
What?

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:50.910
Feed me.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:53.180
I'm hungry.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.210
I've never asked you this.

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:23.550
Does it feel awkward

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:25.380
seeing the two of us girls like this?

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.120
No.

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:27.280
But I'm curious,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.040
how did you know she was the one?

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.640
At first you think she's trouble,

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:45.260
but you keep getting dragged along by her.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.360
Then you start worrying.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.670
Worrying if you're not by her side,

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:51.610
will something happen to her?

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:53.240
And then

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.960
you make her your responsibility.

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:58.160
You want to keep her safe,

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:01.750
so she never leaves you
for the rest of your life.

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:06.490
But,

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.090
he's always ready to walk away.

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:16.070
Turns out Haru and I were wrong.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.570
You're the one secretly in love.

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.000
As if I'd fall for

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:22.430
a man pushing seventy.

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:26.640
Cha's personality
is a bit old-fashioned though.

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:28.410
Totally like my dad.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.980
Anyway, liking someone

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.980
has nothing to do with age or gender.

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:38.620
You usually keep your distance
from everyone.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.530
So why is Xia the exception?

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.190
Since you're not pushing him away,

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:46.600
and you even keep him in your heart...

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:50.390
If you really like him,

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:52.530
don't let it slip away.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:53.810
Go for it.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:54.570
Go for it.

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:52.290
How's your butt now?

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:56.800
Much better.

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:06.490
[When you want to stay by someone's side,
there's always a reason. What's yours?]

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.280
How's your butt now?

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:22.760
Much better.

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:03.960
[Next Episode Preview]

00:23:58.660 --> 00:23:59.660
Why'd you kiss me?

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:01.200
You kissed me first.

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:04.090
Do you believe in lovers from a past life?

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:05.800
If you found one,

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:07.670
shouldn't you hold on tight?

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.970
You feel differently about me.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:15.890
Stop fighting.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.720
You're not dogs in a ring.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.280
I thought I mattered to you.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.180
Turns out,

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:23.040
your body likes him better.

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:24.550
How are you any different
from Guan Riqing?
