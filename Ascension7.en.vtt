00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:16.220
Give me that!

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:17.060
Get it!

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:17.890
Hurry!

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.370
Quickly!

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:19.766
Whose is this?

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.100
- Oh, you.
- My talisman!

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:22.630
This token

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:24.110
couldn't have come at a better time.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:25.510
I'll remember you.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:26.846
This is yours.

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:27.870
Hold up.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:28.910
My talisman.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:29.580
Where is he?

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.560
At the bottom of the north valley.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:52.060
Mentor.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:52.940
What precious possessions

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:54.270
have you brought today?

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.660
[Hongfu, Yellow Maple Valley]

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:58.576
[Zhong Lingdao, Yellow Maple Valley
Sect Master] Snow Mountain Ice Lotus.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.610
Paired with hundred-year
banana leaf you brought,

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:01.940
it balances cold and heat.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.120
Nourishes the spirit root.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.720
Excellent.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.240
Wu.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.440
What about you?

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.100
[Wu Mian, Yellow Maple Valley]
What I brought is nothing

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.940
compared to what you all have.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:15.490
That's a fine item.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:16.630
Nine Heavens Mystic Cicada.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:18.300
Gentlest of all.

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:20.550
Please.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.400
What tea are we having today?

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:28.670
Let's enjoy some fine tea.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.360
Allow me.

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:35.750
Watch this.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.440
Excellent tea.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:45.790
Enjoy.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:52.510
Having tea without me?

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:54.630
Here comes the tea moocher.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.720
Quick! Finish the tea!

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:01.006
I hope the tea scalds you,

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:02.370
you money-grubber.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.710
Who says I am mooching tea?

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.360
Look.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.700
I brought something.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.440
A hundred-year spirit herb.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.840
Excellent choice.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:15.340
Hongfu,

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:16.730
I brought it just for you.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:19.750
Everyone,

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.920
today Yellow Maple Valley
welcomes a rare guest,

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.726
someone who's the likes of whom we
haven't encountered in a hundred years.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:26.060
Come

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:26.890
and have a look at this.

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.030
What is it?

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.696
I'm Song Meng, a Foundation
Establishment disciple

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.250
of Yellow Maple Valley.

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:35.576
This is my sixth junior brother,

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.060
Wu Xuan,

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.060
and this is our seventh junior sister.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.110
So he is the one who
brought the Ascension Token?

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.440
That is right.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.150
What is your name?

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.960
My name is Han Li.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.320
Why is he here?

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.310
That guy has

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
the Ascension Token?

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.420
That guy?

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.200
No way.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:01.946
Someone with a fake spirit root

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:03.650
couldn't possibly have an Ascension Token.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.120
They say anyone who enters
with an Ascension Token

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.150
receives a Foundation Pill by default.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:10.630
Why?

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:12.696
Because their ancestors
rendered great service

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:13.720
in the past.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.980
He doesn't look like someone
from a meritorious bloodline.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:19.650
A mere mortal

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:20.580
trying to sneak into the cultivation world.

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:21.976
Their ancestors did great service?

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.976
Cultivation clans use their
most precious resources

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.420
on their own descendants.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:26.646
Even I had

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.366
to fight for my life at
Tianwu Arena just to earn

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:29.980
the right to a Foundation Pill.

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:31.510
What gives him

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.030
the right?

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.120
Enough.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.650
We are here to cultivate,

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.240
so let us focus on that.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:39.790
Do not judge others.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.606
Understood.

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:41.096
Got it.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.120
Qiaoqian is right.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.120
We came here to become cultivators,

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:45.010
unlike someone

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.846
who came to be a toad lusting after a swan.

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:47.870
Right.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.010
Pay no mind to their comments.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.760
Four of the five elements spirit roots,

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:58.790
all at once.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.730
You could not ask for worse.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.650
Indeed.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.240
And a fake spirit root at that.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:05.510
Indeed.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.720
Which clan would waste

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.840
an Ascension Token

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.340
on someone this useless?

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:12.646
If I remember correctly,

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.886
sect rule 23 states that anyone
bearing the Ascension Token

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:16.580
must be accepted

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.200
without questioning

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.370
their background or aptitude.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:22.630
That is right.

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:23.940
And by the rules,

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:26.550
he should be given one
Foundation Pill as well.

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:27.630
What?

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:28.870
Giving him a Foundation Pill

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.010
is such a waste.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.490
What about my disciples then?

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.646
Yellow Maple Valley has
already done him a huge favor

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:39.180
by accepting this fake spirit root.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:40.950
Must we give him a Foundation Pill too?

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.320
What is owed must be given.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.980
We can't break the rules over one pill.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:45.460
Indeed.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.526
If word gets out,

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.246
we'll become the target of
mockery from the other six sects.

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:49.270
Indeed.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.080
He's right.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.120
Regardless of his talent,

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.600
he should be accepted

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:55.670
into the sect.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.376
The Foundation Pill should

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.400
be given too.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.080
However...

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.320
However what?

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:02.510
The Foundation Pill quota

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.820
is set in advance every year.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.366
This year, we only prepared
one, for the champion

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:08.390
of the Tainan Bazaar.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:09.976
If we give it to this newcomer,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:10.610
then the champion

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:11.840
will not get one.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.060
Then so be it.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.770
My suggestion is

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.340
that we temporarily replace it with gems.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.606
After all, the champion

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:22.130
will surely qualify next year.

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:24.176
Well.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.200
It's settled then.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.480
It's settled then.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:29.460
Wu,

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:30.340
go.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:31.790
And welcome him into the valley.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.890
Yes, Sect Master.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:35.460
Hongu.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:36.960
Please.

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:38.030
You brat,

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.890
I just repaid that gambling favor earlier.

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:42.486
Let's have some tea.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:43.510
Come.

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:45.460
Lovely tea.

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:48.370
Sect Master Zhong,

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:49.670
where's my cup?

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:51.510
Here you go.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:53.940
No tea for latecomers.

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:57.710
The tea's rather ordinary.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:03.030
It's good.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:04.750
There's more.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Really?

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:12.910
Senior Wu.

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:16.550
Senior Wu.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.250
You are the one

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:26.576
who brought the Ascension Token?

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:27.600
Yes.

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:28.910
My name is Han Li.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.240
The Ascension Token is a rare item.

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:34.270
Even I have never seen one before.

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:36.180
How did you come by it?

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.696
It was passed down from my ancestors.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.320
Are you perhaps from a cultivation clan?

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.160
Or do you have a senior family member

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.770
working in one of the seven sects?

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:51.290
I come from the mortal world.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.200
I am not from a cultivation clan.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:58.960
No matter.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.520
The Ascension Token is rare.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:04.390
The fact that you received one means
you have fate with Yellow Maple Valley.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:05.790
My surname is Wu.

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:07.030
From now on,

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:08.490
you may call me Mentor Wu.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.110
Welcome

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.310
to Yellow Maple Valley.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.480
I am

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.700
officially

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:39.880
a disciple

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:40.960
of Yellow Maple Valley

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.480
now.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.400
Thank you, Mentor Wu.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.090
For today,

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.330
I will act as your guide

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:09.030
and help you

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:10.310
understand

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.010
the basic rules of the valley.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:13.920
Follow me.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:27.460
Mentor,

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.680
watch your step.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.040
That is the Qianji Library.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.360
It holds basic cultivation
manuals and alchemy recipes.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.040
You can borrow them by paying gems.

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:35.490
I also

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.940
work there.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:39.807
To the west is where.

00:20:39.831 --> 00:20:41.330
Qi Refining Stage disciples live.

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:43.306
Aside from being hot like a steam furnace,

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:44.660
it is not too bad.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.456
If you have enough gems,

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.696
you can apply to move to the rear mountain,

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.140
where the accommodation is better.

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:51.510
Move aside.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:20:59.770
Otherwise,

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.006
you will have to wait until you
reach the Foundation Establishment,

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:01.700
Thank you.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.240
And establish your personal abode.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.376
There are many things that
require gems in the valley.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.010
How can I earn them?

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.360
You can go to Baiji Hall and take on tasks

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.440
to earn gems.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
What kind of tasks?

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.027
Tasks such as

00:21:14.051 --> 00:21:15.640
caring for spirit beasts in the valley,

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.090
supervising mining
operations at the quarries,

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:19.090
or instructing new disciples

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.137
in basic techniques

00:21:20.161 --> 00:21:21.700
at the Chuangong Pavilion.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:22.980
Each task pays a different amount

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.860
depending on its difficulty.

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:27.570
Baiji Hall is overseen by Mentor Ye.

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:29.630
He has a rather eccentric temperament,

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:30.830
so stay sharp around him.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.530
This is the Alchemy Room.

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:43.110
Once you've saved up enough gems,

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.160
you can come here.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:11.460
Ye.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.640
What are you doing so early in the morning?

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:14.790
I brought a new disciple

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.140
to pick up his entry supplies.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.696
Didn't someone just come earlier?

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:18.840
Why are we doing this again?

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.140
Greetings, Mentor Ye.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.136
You must be the one
with the Ascension Token?

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.250
Even you've heard about it.

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:27.860
These youngsters

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:29.376
have no interest in learning,

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.360
but they are all experts
when it comes to gossip.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.010
You may not have much talent,

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:40.860
but you sure are lucky.

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:48.110
Wait here.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:02.510
Don't touch anything.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:07.510
Come here.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:14.980
[Cultivation Basics]

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:18.216
This is the Yellow
Maple Valley entry token.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.526
Draw a strand of spiritual
power and inject it to activate it.

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:21.990
After that, it will be bound to you.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.150
Go ahead and infuse your spiritual power.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.810
A tenfold mystic pouch,

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.250
one Cultivation Basics,

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.380
a set of daily refining tools,

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:41.810
the Solarflame Sword and Cold Moon Blade,

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.780
and a yellow entry robe.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.620
You will take tasks to earn gems,

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:50.806
and spend them on gear

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:51.940
and tools here with me.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:54.770
Come back when you have more gems.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:57.400
Thank you, Mentor Ye.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:10.220
Well?

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:11.616
Does the Yellow Maple
Valley disciple's robe

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.980
not look flawless?

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.440
It does.

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.380
It is the first time in my life

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.380
I have seen a robe without stitching.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:22.680
Walk with me.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.360
That is about all you need to know

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.680
about the valley for now.

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:29.310
According to sect rules,

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.456
anyone entering with an
Ascension Token is to receive

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.980
a Foundation Pill in advance.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:34.730
This one

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.240
is yours.

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:39.270
Take it.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000
A word of advice.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:43.090
There are many

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:44.350
who covet Foundation Pills.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.700
Keep it safe.

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:47.110
If you lose it,

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.000
no amount of gems will get you another.

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:54.110
Thank you, Mentor.

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:55.806
I am responsible

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:58.070
for teaching the disciples
basic cultivation techniques.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.490
If you ever encounter
difficulty in your cultivation,

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:01.830
come find me anytime.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.006
I will never forget your guidance

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:06.030
when I succeed

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:08.620
in reaching the Foundation Establishment.

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:11.110
Don't worry about Foundation
Establishment just yet.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.460
Regardless of whether you succeed,

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:19.310
this pill must be

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:20.530
carefully safeguarded.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.400
I'll remember that.

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:24.140
Thank you.

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:25.390
Hurry back to your quarters.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.940
Even if they gave me a Foundation Pill,

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:31.870
with a fake spirit root like mine,

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.040
I'll never reach the
Foundation Establishment.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.900
That must be

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.400
what he meant.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.090
Don't give me that look.

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:27.110
Wasted on the undeserving.

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:30.136
Like giving a lamp to a blind man.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.400
An absolute waste of resources.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.700
Look at that snow. So white.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.090
Hey, it's Ascension Token!

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:26.550
Ascension Token!

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:28.810
My name is Han Li.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.246
"Han Li" doesn't sound nearly as
impressive as "Ascension Token."

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:32.430
Why not just rename yourself?

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.120
You can be "Ascension Token" from now on.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.530
You two, that's enough.

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:47.140
Grandmaster Hongfu.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.730
Choose a leaf you like.

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:03.376
You will ride it

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.400
through the skies.

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:07.376
Yellow Maple Valley's expanse is such that,

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.420
using just your legs,

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:10.150
you wouldn't cover it in ten days.

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:12.110
If you can't fly,

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:13.510
you'll never find

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.640
your place here.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.420
Most of you have only taken flight

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.250
in your dreams.

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:21.590
Some are too timid

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:23.770
to even dare dream of flying.

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.640
Those people

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:26.870
will never leave the ground.

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:28.460
Cultivation begins

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.730
by breaking past the limits in your heart.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:32.550
If the Kunpeng can soar,

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:33.960
so can people.

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:35.790
Harness the power of Heaven and Earth,

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:36.730
command

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:37.830
the six energies,

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:39.550
and fly upon the wind

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:40.590
through the void.

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:42.330
Grandmaster,

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.460
are you saying that if we believe,

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.640
we can fly?

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.936
Then what does that make us cultivators?

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.860
Fools chasing dreams?

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:53.246
Whether something is possible is one thing,

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:54.940
but whether you can do it is another.

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:56.510
Just because others can

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:57.570
doesn't mean you can.

00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:59.150
Just because others cannot

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:00.770
doesn't mean you cannot.

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:03.856
Remain steady in both praise and shame,

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.376
and let your heart guide your every move.

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.460
This is the state

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.920
that cultivators seek to attain.

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:11.510
All right.

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:12.660
I've explained

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:13.830
what needs to be explained.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.140
Fly beyond the mountain ahead,

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:18.810
and you will be

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.080
formally inducted as disciples
of Yellow Maple Valley.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.680
Any other questions?

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:30.700
Grandmaster Hongfu,

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:31.810
we just need

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:32.660
to fly over the mountain.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:34.560
We don't need to use these leaves, do we?

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:36.680
The choice is yours.

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:40.230
I will be waiting on the other side.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.770
I don't need this lousy leaf!

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:44.900
Come on!

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:45.770
Come on!

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.290
Let's go.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.640
Let's go!

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.040
How did this turn into tug-of-war?

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:47.030
Harness the power of Heaven and Earth.

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.680
Command

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.490
the six energies.

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:09.310
Here I go!

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:17.120
With the Kunpeng in my heart,

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:19.220
I will surely take flight.

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:24.550
This is too slow.

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:26.420
This is no Kunpeng.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.250
This is a bug.

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:46.310
What do you think?

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.620
When did you learn this spell?

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.700
While the flowers of April
fade in the mortal realm,

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.200
peach blossoms bloom
anew at the mountain temple.

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:57.830
It's just a small trick of mine.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.046
Don't let Xuan'er see you

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:01.220
using this.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.090
Seeing all these flowers and plants

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.200
will only distract her
more from her cultivation.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.770
You're right.

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:09.270
One moment.

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:19.420
There.

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:20.720
No more of that.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:21.920
I'll never use that again.

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:29.570
Hongfu,

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.246
why are this year's

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:32.416
new disciples

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.530
so untalented?

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:35.200
They're the worst group I've ever seen.

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:37.570
That's not entirely true.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:45.246
What about the disciple
with the Ascension Token?

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:46.856
Surely, his possession of such a rare item

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:47.460
indicates

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:49.390
that there is something
exceptional about him.

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:52.900
It is a waste of a Foundation Pill.

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:56.290
Still, he is not without merit.

00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:59.290
Maybe because he knows

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:01.110
he is mediocre,

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:01.940
he has

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000
a good attitude

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.200
and strong will.

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:12.570
A human life is short,
like trees in autumn.

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:15.220
With talent like his,

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:16.486
I fear

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:17.860
he might grow old and die

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.320
before he ever uses that Foundation Pill.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:41.480
What was that for?

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:45.250
I gave him some wind to wield.

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:47.700
Let us see if he is a sparrow

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:49.790
or a great swan.

From today onward,

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:13.610
you are officially disciples

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:15.230
of Yellow Maple Valley.

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:17.030
As your Sect Master,

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:18.420
I have only one request.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.610
Focus on your cultivation

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:22.260
and avoid causing trouble.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.460
Your purpose here

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:27.110
is cultivation.

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.040
The first major milestone in cultivation

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.840
is the Foundation Establishment Stage.

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.376
- Once you reach the Foundation Establishment...
- Want some?

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:34.740
I'm fine.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:35.170
Thank you.

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:36.550
You can absorb

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:37.170
the essence

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:38.990
of the sun, moon, earth, and heavens.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:41.006
You will no longer need to consume food

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:42.230
or take in worldly impurities.

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:45.510
So,

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:46.530
even if

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.320
you are still in the Qi Refining Stage,

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:49.400
you should already

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:50.510
begin practicing fasting.

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:12.340
You should eat later.

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:14.170
It's fine.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.480
I can eat

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:16.510
while he talks.

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:28.170
I can understand if it takes time

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.260
to let go of gourmet food.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.840
But if you can't even put
down a piece of flatbread,

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:35.830
how will you ever succeed in cultivation?

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:38.740
Who says cultivating means you can't eat?

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:41.340
My family told me

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:43.110
there's a Core Formation Grandmaster

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:44.260
who loved eating.

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:46.360
They carry all their utensils with them.

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:48.046
What's wrong with me eating a flatbread?

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:49.300
It's better than starving.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.880
Bad examples shouldn't be followed.

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:54.790
Is there really a Core
Formation Grandmaster

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:55.740
that greedy?

00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:57.070
Indeed.

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.440
Don't listen to his nonsense.

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.010
What a joke.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.520
Is there really be such a
gluttonous Core Formation cultivator?

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:09.561
The rule of the Ascension
Token was set by our ancestors.

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:11.256
It's not something that can be changed.

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.736
If you work hard and make good progress

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:13.960
with your variant spirit root,

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:15.510
the Valley may grant you

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:17.460
another Foundation Pill as a reward.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:18.800
Another one?

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:25.670
These 300 gems

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:26.710
are compensation

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:28.110
for you.

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.650
Sect Master,

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:31.736
I was the champion at the Tianwu Arena.

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:32.570
According to sect rules,

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:34.070
I should receive a Foundation Pill.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.530
You were simply unlucky.

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:40.320
By the sect's rules,

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.080
the Foundation Pill must go to him first.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:44.460
That

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:45.980
is a rule

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.400
we cannot alter.

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:49.740
Sect Master,

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:50.820
I cannot accept this!

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:51.920
Enough.

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:54.840
Just accept your loss and move on.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:56.680
Did you not hear what the Sect Master said?

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:59.206
The Foundation Pill goes to
the Ascension Token holder first.

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:00.780
- But...
- You are engaged

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:03.530
to the daughter of the Chen family.

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:07.260
The Chen family has
plenty of Foundation Pills.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.000
What's the matter?

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:11.310
Too proud to ask them for one?

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:16.776
If you want to blame someone,

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.460
blame the one with Ascension Token.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.320
Watch closely.

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:37.780
Did everyone understand?

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:40.486
Is there learn a specific
technique you wish to learn?

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:40.940
Mentor.

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:42.530
- Mentor.
- Mentor.

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:45.690

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:04.530
A fake spirit root wants

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.490
to learn Aura Concealment?

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.040
What aura do you have to hide?

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:10.630
Aura Concealment,

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.000
as the name suggests,

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.480
uses spiritual aura

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:15.230
to isolate yourself from the outside world.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.480
If done well,

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:18.090
it can hide

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.440
your presence

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:20.420

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:38.420

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.686
No wonder they call it Aura Concealment.
