00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.240
So this is...

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.490
Ms. Emma.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.600
Tojo-san, you probably don't know her, right?

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.200
But she's really perfect for this cosmetics promotion.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.100
The beauty products Emma introduced during her livestream

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.740
are well-known among all young women.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.500
Thank you, Keishi.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.280
Yes.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.850
I didn't expect you to know so much about this.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.300
In our generation, everyone knows her,
no matter if they're male or female.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.140
Even though the client agreed and we also sent out an invitation,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.450
she insists on only promoting products she genuinely likes.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.200
We finally managed to secure a chance to present directly, but...

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.590
But... it just so happens that the person in charge
on the client's side changed.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.100
I heard it's a newly appointed section chief…

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.830
Got it.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.300
I'll be joining as well.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.800
- Thank you so much.
- Thanks, that really puts my mind at ease.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.500
Alright! We absolutely have to nail this project!

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.300
- Thank you.
- We'll head out now.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.020
Then I'll show you the latest presentation materials that
I'm going to share with Emma. Could you help me do a final check?

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.820
No problem.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.390
So young!

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.500
"10 Things I Want to Do Before I Turn 40"
(Episode 4)

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.200
(Placing insanely customized orders at the café)

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.400
I had such a great time spending my day off with Keishi.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.300
- Wow, that's amazing!
- That's amazing!

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.700
Hey, Tojo-san.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.000
I'm not just acting on a whim.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.700
I think, “I'm not just acting on a whim”
that's probably true, too.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.400
What kind of person will the new section chief be?

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.000
Meeting someone for the first time really makes you nervous.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.800
But...

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.200
Hello.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.400
I'm Sakuma, taking over this project from the previous lead, Ono.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.850
No matter how I look at it, I still feel uneasy.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.740
This is my senior from the university volleyball team
who was two years ahead of me.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.220
Really?

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.610
Long time no see.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.100
It's really been a long time.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.760
Did you get a little taller?

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.650
- No way, senpai.
- I think there's probably someone out there who's a better match for Keishi.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.700
It's really been a long time.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.150
You haven't changed at all.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.500
I was really surprised.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.500
Plus, Keishi is even younger than me,
he's a full 10 years younger.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.360
Has everyone already seen it?

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.800
Even I love that makeup product so much myself.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.740
I seriously want to recommend it to everyone!

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.300
Btw, I didn't expect you guys to be senior
and junior in school. What a coincidence!

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.540
I also heard Keishi's name during the handover.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:42.430
Ah...

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.800
I was really surprised when I heard Tanaka-san's name.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.480
Just call me Keishi.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.870
Is that so? Then I'll just call you Keishi.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.700
But running into each other again after graduation,
this has to be fate.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.950
You could have let me know, since you're back in town.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.950
I've been at the Osaka branch this whole time.
I just recently came back to Tokyo.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.000
I see.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.500
Sakuma-san, your skin is really smooth!

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.900
I know it sounds like I'm bragging,
but I think it's thanks to our face masks.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.500
I actually use your company's face masks myself, too.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.700
Thank you.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.200
Putting in consistent effort every day really does matter.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.200
Yeah, that's right.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.300
Are you keeping up with it too?

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.080
Huh?

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.110
I am doing it! I think I'm doing okay.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.580
Let me take a look.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.800
You're too close!

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.240
Is that not okay?

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.440
I'm not saying it's not okay, it's just that we're at work today.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.960
You're right, sorry about that.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.000
Your skin looks great.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.650
Not at all. I actually take care of it every single day.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.500
Huh? But you're 30…?

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.500
I'm 32 this year.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.030
Oh wow, Emma-chan is really adorable.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.260
Tojo-san, thank you as well for helping to follow up.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.120
It's great that the promotional plans were finalized smoothly.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.200
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.210
Here are the face masks for you, from Sakuma-san.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.420
These are for Tojo-san.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.700
- I'll pass.
- Sorry!

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.630
Sorry, it was a call from Sakuma-san.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:45.800
Huh? What's up?

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.200
Hello?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.800
Thank you so much for earlier.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.000
Tojo-san, can I ask if you've ever used a face mask before?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.200
No, I haven't.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.000
Then let's start over from the beginning.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I'll bring a variety of different face masks.
Please try them out and see which one you like best.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.850
- One second, please. - Why?
- No need, I only have one face anyway.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.550
- But if Tojo-san gets more handsome, everyone else will start taking care of their skin too.
- Um...

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.800
He's asking if you want to grab a drink together later.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:14.500
The two of us together.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.800
Sure, I don't have anything urgent going on anyway.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.400
Then I'll go ahead and tell them.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.300
Sure.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.600
No problem.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.400
No, that would be going too far.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.200
Hey, bro, you're back!

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.000
There's still some garlic chili pasta.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.200
Even if I try harder at this point...

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.000
Putting in consistent effort every day really does matter.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.700
Challenge.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.500
Forget it, forget it.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.600
Is it really okay to just leave it like this,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.200
Suzume-chan?

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.000
Tojo-san, the next meeting with Miss Emma

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.600
will probably be scheduled for this Saturday.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.620
Sakuma-san is okay with it, right?

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.300
Yes.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.160
He agreed right away, saying he'd go to the sauna
with Keishi while he's at it.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.200
Alright, that's enough.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.800
I see.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.420
Sorry to trouble you on your day off. Thanks so much.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.000
- Okay.
- Alright, I'll head out first.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.800
I'll get in touch with Sakuma-san.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:01.800
Okay.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.400
Thanks for your hard work.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.500
That's way too much whipped cream!

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.960
This is something that can completely wipe away all my stress.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.270
A custom drink with an insane amount of whipped cream!

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.400
You're amazing.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.150
Really? Isn't that pretty normal?

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:26.000
I just feel like...

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.300
I'm a little jealous.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.400
What's up?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.980
Did the deal fall through?

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.120
Not at all.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.110
What is it?

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:35.500
Are you not getting along with your subordinates?

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.270
Ah... it's probably the opposite, actually.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:41.170
I just feel like I'm always being taught by my subordinates.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:42.200
What are you talking about?

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.060
Showing off much?

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.100
Not at all.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.500
Isn't that a good thing?

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.010
Huh?

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.430
Hmm...

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.700
I mean, there's nothing wrong with learning something from your subordinates.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.060
Kuroki, have you ever experienced that too?

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.320
Yeah, I have.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:08.650
If anything, lately I've been learning about
the trending videos from my youngest daughter.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.150
Isn't your youngest daughter still in kindergarten?

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.000
All that info is stuff she brings back from kindergarten.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.300
Even us old guys evolve with time.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.300
So there are actually so many beauty videos out there!

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.200
Hello everyone, I'm Kazunosuke.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.310
The topic of today's video is how to wash your face in the morning.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:01.300
Please wash your face with lukewarm water,
around 36 to 37 degrees Celsius.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.000
- If the water is too cold, it might not clean off all the dirt.
- Lukewarm water...

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.640
If the water is too hot, it can be too harsh on your skin.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.300
So try to be moderate...

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.950
Wash youor face with the temperature that feels

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.300
“just a little warm”.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
(Face mask)

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.500
Folded so neatly!

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:23.880
Huh?

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.000
Wow, that's amazing!

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
It sticks to your hands.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.360
Which side is the front and which is the back?

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.700
Suzume-chan, let's get pretty together!

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.000
Yay!

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.800
Yeah, that's right! Right over there!

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Thank you.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.860
Amazing!

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.800
So I really can change.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.500
(Dark Chocolate Mocha Cream Frappe)

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.960
(Placing insanely customized orders at the café)

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.700
Life is all about learning and growing.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.000
And also taking on new challenges.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.020
One dark chocolate mocha cream frappé.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.100
Thank you.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.600
Welcome!

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.000
Have you decided what you'd like to order?

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.000
Ah! Um...

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:03.500
This tastes so good!

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.200
Today's coffee.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.700
At that time...

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:22.500
I was only able to do it because Keishi was there.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.100
Here you go, please enjoy.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.400
No... I don't really feel like eating anything in particular.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.400
Why are you being so polite?

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.200
Isn't today exactly one of those days?

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.000
If you like something, just like it.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.800
(Keishi Tanaka calling)

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:51.600
Hello?

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.000
It's fine.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.270
Huh?

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:58.400
She broke a bone?

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.300
Ah! No, wait a second.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.500
Yeah, it's all good!

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.950
How is Emma's injury?

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:16.400
I heard it'll take 2 months to fully recover.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.000
Looks like makeup work is off the table for now.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:20.600
I see...

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.300
- We're really sorry for all the trouble caused.
- We're truly sorry.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.700
Please have a seat.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.660
Excuse me.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:30.700
So...

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:36.500
Among the candidates we suggested,
if it's these two, their schedules should work.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.400
Hmm, that's a bit difficult.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.700
After all, Emma is just such a perfect fit.

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:43.800
Yeah, you're right...

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.860
What I'm thinking right now is to
have Ms. Sayaka and Ms. Yuri take charge.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.680
How about having the two of them work together
to move this project forward?

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.100
No, if we do it that way, it'll lack a bit of freshness.
It just doesn't feel strong enough.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.400
Yeah, you're right...

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.400
Um...

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.000
If you don't mind.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.800
Can I suggest a new candidate?

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.800
Hello everyone, I'm Kazunosuke.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:15.740
Today,

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:19.050
- So, back to 2024.
- Huh, are you talking about Mr. Kazunosuke?

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:20.400
Do you know him?

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.400
Yes, I think he has a lot of potential.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.070
He's really popular among middle school and high school students!

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:27.100
That's right.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.750
For a beauty newbie like me, his explanations
are not only easy to understand, but also really thoughtful.

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:35.900
I think this also aligns really well with the target audience
for this budget-friendly line.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
It might actually be pretty good.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:38.840
Huh?

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:40.700
It feels really fresh.

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.700
Let's give it a try!

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.000
Thank you so much.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.500
I look forward to working with you.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:03.000
A few days ago, I went to cheer Kazunosuke up.
He's really looking forward to this shoot, too.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:03.690
Yes.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:05.200
Does the schedule look okay?

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.200
No problem.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.000
That's good to hear. Keishi, do you have any issues on your end?

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.700
Hello everyone, I'm Kazunosuke.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:13.400
Today…

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:18.200
The video hit over 1 million views in just half a day.
It's really gone viral.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:22.000
The number of pre-orders for the
new makeup line also hit our first-day target.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.210
We did it!

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
It was your idea to bring in Kazunosuke, right, Tojo-san?

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.050
You were a huge help.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:30.600
That's such a surprise! How did you know about him?

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.400
Tanaka, that was really disrespectful to the team leader.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.810
It's fine, really, don't worry about it.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.700
Honestly, I really didn't know anything.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.800
You went out of your way to learn it, didn't you?

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:38.800
Not at all.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.930
I'm really happy.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:45.800
No matter how old you are, it's great to be
able to try new things. Age really isn't an issue.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.270
I couldn't have done this without you guys.

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:49.320
Thank you, everyone.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.500
We should be the ones saying thank you.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.800
Huh? Tojo-san, your skin looks different!

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.800
Tojo-san is really amazing!

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.850
Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:10.200
We were just in the same place before,
but now it feels like you've already moved so much further ahead.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.000
That's not true at all.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.200
I just can't keep up anymore.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.500
So it's the same.

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.300
Even Keishi feels like there's some distance between us.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.700
- Keishi.
- Yes?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.600
But I just can't handle custom orders at coffee shops.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.000
You mean the list?

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:40.300
Yeah, I thought I could probably handle it on my own, you know?

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.000
Turns out I just couldn't do it at all.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.500
How about we go to a café together now?

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:51.090
What?

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:55.000
Let's order some insanely customized drinks!

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:08.800
Welcome!

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.300
Have you decided what you'd like to order?

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.600
Yes.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.000
Um...

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.130
One black chocolate mocha cream frappé.

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:37.800
One dark chocolate mocha cream frappé, got it.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.600
Tojo-san, would you like to customize anything?

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.800
Please substitute the milk with almond milk.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.260
Got it.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:50.640
Extra...

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:52.320
chocolate chips.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.540
Extra chocolate chips.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:54.900
Is that everything you'd like to order?

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:57.500
Tojo-san, would you like to add whipped cream?

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.990
A little extra whipped cream.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:05.000
Alright, is that everything for your order?

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.290
- Yes.
- Alright.

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:11.330
You ordered a dark chocolate mocha frappé
with the milk swapped for almond milk, plus extra chocolate chips.

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:13.340
A little extra whipped cream, all confirmed.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:14.800
Thank you.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:35.510
This is so good!

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.500
You really do have a sweet tooth.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:39.810
Don't you feel cold?

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.600
It tastes great even if it's cold.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.200
Why did you want to do it alone?

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:50.500
I mean the list.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.300
Didn't we agree to do this together?

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.800
I thought...

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Maybe you have someone like Sakuma-san by your side...

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.400
Sakuma senpai?

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:10.800
Why?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:12.950
Isn't that obvious?

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.100
You two are really close.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.600
And compared to someone like me,

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.000
Sakuma-san is better for you...

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.400
Senior Sakuma.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.000
He was the first person

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.200
who I genuinely fell for.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.500
He was a senior in my club.

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.500
He's always fair and kind to everyone.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.000
There were always a lot of people around him.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Before I even realized it,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
we started hanging out together, just the two of us, pretty often.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000
And then I just...

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.500
began wondering if he felt the same way about me.

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.400
But that wasn't actually the case.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.700
He ended up dating the club's female manager.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.400
They got married,

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.100
and then they got divorced.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.700
I heard he got married again last year.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.600
I see...

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.800
If you acted this way out of jealousy,
I'd actually be pretty happy about it.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.000
Now, for me,

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.000
I only want you, Tojo-san.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:47.000
So...

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.300
Please have confidence in yourself.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.000
Sorry...

00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.700
right when you're getting to the touching part.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.350
You've got some whipped cream on your lips.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:04.920
Are you kidding me?

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:05.700
Where?

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.450
Just kidding!

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.500
Teasing Tojo-san is just too much fun.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.400
If there are things you can't do alone,

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.500
just do it with someone else.

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.000
Next on the list...

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.000
must be the cake that rules the department store food court.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:39.040
Ah! Before that, I need to go buy something to wear.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:43.000
Anyway, my casual clothes just make me look like a dad on the weekend.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.400
I can't believe a new café just opened here.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:17.000
I want to check it out with him together, someday.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.800
What does he actually like?

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.750
Italian food?

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:29.500
No, he probably likes sushi or meat more.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.600
- Oh! Hey, you're back!
- Yeah, I'm back.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.000
Never have I realized...

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.600
the world could be such a beautiful place.

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.300
I'm also really looking forward to next time.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.200
Good night.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.100
Good night.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.510
(Next Episode)
I'd like to buy some clothes that are good for going out.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:35.190
Is it for a date?

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:36.300
Hmm... yeah.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.060
Rion, Mao, you two are way too enthusiastic!

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.330
You keep staring at me...

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:43.410
Would you mind?

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:44.200
No.
