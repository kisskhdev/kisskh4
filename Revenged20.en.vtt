(Adapted from the novel
"Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.639
(Episode 20,
Men are Like Menstruation:)

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.176
(You Think About It When It Hasn't
Come, But Annoying When It's Here)

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.576
(The love between the frugal mom
and son is as deep as the sea)

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.960
(A great debt of gratitude
for raising me)

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.279
(From your nephew, Wang Yu Chun)

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.599
(Your good virtue last forever,
always pure in heart)

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.000
(In memory of aunt, from your niece)

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.760
Let's go.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.280
Stop crying.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.320
My condolences.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.879
(Offering to the Deceased)

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.880
I know.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.400
I understand you two.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.720
I'm just afraid.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.440
I'm afraid that in the future,

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.040
you'll have a hard time.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.120
My condolences.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.120
Take good care of yourself.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.480
I'll wait for you outside.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.080
(Offering to the Deceased)

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.120
My condolences.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.200
I'll get going.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:00.960
Okay.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:21.000
(From your son, Chi Cheng)

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.760
Wang Zhen.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.200
I'll take you home.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.520
This year's loquat harvest
is abundant.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.720
Da Qiong.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.720
How come you're free
to come home today?

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.520
I'll cook for you.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.080
What do you want to eat?

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.880
I've decided.

00:05:46.881 --> 00:05:48.520
I'll cook your favorite
braised pork.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.280
And some sliced potatoes.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:11.240
(Fortune)

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.560
You're an adult now.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.720
You must learn
to take care of yourself.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.240
Why are you here?

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.760
To laugh at you.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.520
I heard...

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.240
Wang Zhen took Wang Shuo away.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.520
Why aren't you going after him?

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.520
I haven't seen you upset enough.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.880
How can I leave with Wang Shuo?

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.480
Fine.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.760
Look.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.280
Look all you want in one go.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.360
Look at how thin you are now.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.800
You used to be all right.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.280
Now, you don't even look human.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.120
You know what?

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.080
Seeing you like this now...

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.160
makes me feel so good.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.360
Cry.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.920
I'm here to see you cry today.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.760
The more you cry, the happier I am.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.840
You tricked me.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.840
You deserve to suffer.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.680
No one would feel bad for you.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.560
(Sugar Figure Blowing)

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.000
Stop crying! Do you hear me?

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.960
I told you to stop crying.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.960
Do you hear me?

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.600
Wei Wei.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:43.760
Stop crying.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.040
Don't cry.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
All right.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.760
That's enough, Wei Wei.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.280
Don't cry.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.600
Be good.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:25.800
Be good.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.320
Be good.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.400
Don't go.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.800
I'm not leaving.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.240
I'll get you some tissues.

00:10:52.241 --> 00:10:53.600
Don't go.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.280
Okay.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.160
I won't go.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.360
I'm not leaving.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.160
I won't leave.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.200
Did you wipe your snot
on my clothes?

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.440
I just changed into these clothes.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.120
I don't care.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.520
- I want you to stay with me.
- Okay.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.080
You have to stay with me.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.280
How about this?

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.760
I'll travel with you
in a couple of days.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
What do you think?

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.600
Then why did you...

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.720
Why did you come to see me today?

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.040
I want to come whenever I want,

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:43.960
depending on how long...

00:11:43.961 --> 00:11:45.321
I can bear you being away from me.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.760
Then from now on,

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.880
don't ever leave me again.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.680
I won't leave you again.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.320
I won't.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.080
I won't leave anymore.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:14.920
Mom, wash your feet.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.240
Wei Wei.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.600
Stop watching TV.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.880
I'm here.
Isn't it enough to look at me?

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.800
Let me tell you.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.000
I'm really good at cooking now.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.960
Look.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.400
It looks a bit ugly.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.760
But it's still edible.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.600
You don't like it?

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.960
Come on.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.416
I'll take you out
to eat something good.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.440
What are you doing?

00:12:51.441 --> 00:12:52.801
I'll take you out for a good meal.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.040
My slippers.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.480
Let's go.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.400
You want to eat loquats?

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.520
Yes.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.520
I'll pick some for you.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.320
Here.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.280
Okay. All right.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.240
Don't eat it. Eat something else.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.120
Watermelon.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.200
I'll give you a piece.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.480
It's better than that.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.640
One more piece.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.840
What song did you sing last time?

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.080
Let me think.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.680
Do things as simply as you want

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.880
It's the philosophy my mom taught me

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.640
Mom.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.200
Wei Wei, what's wrong?

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.080
I'm really speechless
with the lyrics.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.520
All right. Come on.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.520
It's okay.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.000
All right. I'm here.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.560
Since you like
grocery shopping so much,

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.120
why don't I open one for you?

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.200
You have no idea
about the joy of grocery shopping.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.760
We don't have
to eat scrambled eggs tonight.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.480
Wei Wei.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.320
Here.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.640
Try it.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.000
You haven't paid.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.720
We'll pay outside. Let's go.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.720
Let's go. I'll take you
to a bigger supermarket.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.600
Mr. Chi.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.280
You're still here?

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.280
Yes.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.440
Come in.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.840
You're still working overtime?
It's so late.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.080
I'm traveling with Mr. Wu
in a few days.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.760
I'm trying to catch up with work.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.799
Then I might need to extend
your overtime work...

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.800
for a few more minutes.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.360
It's okay. Give it to me.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.840
Our tax filing deadline
is coming up.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.440
The Finance personnel has
something to do today,

00:16:09.441 --> 00:16:11.161
so he went home
and asked me to come to you.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.400
Take a look first.

00:16:12.401 --> 00:16:13.736
If there's no problem,
please sign it.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.120
Finance will file this tomorrow.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.480
It should be fine.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.976
Have you gone over it with Finance?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
I have.

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.560
All right then.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.560
(Taxpayer: Chi Cheng)

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.359
If there's nothing else,
I'll get going then.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:30.936
- Okay. Thank you.
- I'm just doing my job.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.000
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.320
Wang Shuo...

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.520
has been gone for so long.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.600
And he's still hiding
Yue Yue so well.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.720
Until now,
Da Wei still can't find her.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.400
Because...

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.720
the one who sent Yue Yue away
after using her...

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.560
wasn't Wang Shuo.

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.360
It was me.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.160
Darn.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:16.800
It was you?

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.240
Do you have to be so surprised?

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.480
Gosh.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.640
What are you up to?

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.280
Did you let Chi Cheng know,

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.080
then...

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.920
make him dump Wu Suo Wei?

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.920
You're not aware.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.800
If we don't expose
this matter about Yue Yue,

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.600
it'll be a threat to them
sooner or later.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.120
Why don't we take
this opportunity to use her well?

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.640
They're both smart people.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000
They'll just...

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.600
get carried away
with anger for a while.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:44.960
After some time,

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.920
they'll slowly understand.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.440
You old fox. You're the best.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.440
Here.

00:17:53.441 --> 00:17:55.040
Try the new product...

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.320
this old fox just created.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.200
If you're opening a cake shop,

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:06.560
it will surely fail.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.160
Eat it.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.440
Okay.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.520
Then I'll just have
to sell my snake farm...

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:15.960
to make ends meet.

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.920
Aren't you going to be
Chi Cheng's backup guy anymore?

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.280
What does it have to do with him?

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.480
I am...

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.720
doing this...

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.320
to save money for my marriage.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.000
What an expensive wife.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.600
Tell me. I'll ask her...

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.320
not to marry you
to save you some money.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.560
Of course I must give...

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.800
more betrothal gifts.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.440
As long as he's willing to agree,

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.120
it's worth it.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.960
It's worth it?

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.920
That won't make him say yes.

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.080
Are you ready?

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:05.760
Wei Wei.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.240
Are you ready?

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.480
I'm ready. Let's go!

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.720
Go!

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.400
Be careful.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.440
Nice!

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.920
- Is it exciting?
- It's so exciting!

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.480
- Great!
- Awesome!

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.400
Do you want to have more fun?

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.520
Yes!

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.240
Darn you!

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.400
Darn you!

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.520
Go to hell!

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.280
Forget it all!

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.000
Forget all your worries!

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.600
Forget them all!

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.840
- Fearless!
- Fearless!

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.160
- Wu Suo Wei!
- Wu Suo Wei!

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.720
It's so pretty!

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:08.800
Are you happy now?

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.200
Yes.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.560
Wei Wei.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.560
During our time apart,

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.840
did you miss me?

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.520
No.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:36.960
What's wrong?

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.440
The last time we had a fight,

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.000
we were also apart
for more than 10 days.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
That's what you said too.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.360
As you know,

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:49.920
sometimes,

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.640
the truth burns your mouth.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.520
You were hiding something.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.880
Rather than live in fear every day,

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.600
I think you should have
just told me.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.760
I haven't even settled
the score with you...

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.800
for what you hid from me.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.200
All right.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.640
From now on,

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.440
let's not dwell on things.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.440
When there's a problem,
let's solve it.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.360
Okay?

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.760
- Okay.
- Come on.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:29.800
Pinky promise.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.200
- It's a deal.
- It's a deal.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.280
You're so childish.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.960
Look, that's our house.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.560
Our house is over there.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.240
Hello?

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.480
Is this Property Management?

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.000
There's a power outage at my house.

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:11.880
Hello, I'm sorry.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.976
There's a power outage
in the whole building.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.456
The circuit
is under emergency repair.

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.800
It can only be restored tomorrow.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.120
Hello?

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.320
Hey, Cheng Yu.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.976
There's a power outage at my house.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.080
- Can you...
- Yes.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.440
I'll pick you up right away.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.160
What are you doing?

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.720
What now?

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.520
Guo Cheng Yu.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.360
Get lost.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:47.920
Three,

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.360
two...

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:30.840
Why are you still up?

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.360
Then...

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.040
What's on your mind?

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.480
Don't worry.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:44.680
I won't try anything.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.520
Go to sleep.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:47.760
Good night.

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:09.920
Scoot over.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.400
After traveling,

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.440
you became so old-fashioned
when you came back.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.000
Xiao Shuai is a neat freak.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.240
How pretentious.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.560
If you're poor like me,

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.160
you can use this too.

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:34.280
What are you doing?

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.280
Pretending to be poor?

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.280
Can you believe this?

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.280
He only gives me 10 yuan a month.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.320
I can't even afford a lighter.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.280
Don't you have a lighter?

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.120
I do have a lighter.

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:46.880
But I can't afford to fill it up.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.776
You can't afford to fill it up?

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.520
Jiang Xiao Shuai
was here last night, right?

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.080
You didn't do anything again, right?

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.719
Who...

00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.720
Who said so?

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.520
Based on what I know about you,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.040
if you succeeded,

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.280
he won't be able
to walk out of this room.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.680
Sometimes, knowing too much...

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.520
is not a good thing.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:18.840
I already wired it.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.600
(Your account received 50,000 yuan)

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000
There's no need.

00:27:28.001 --> 00:27:29.801
It's easy for me to get money
behind his back.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.240
I like...

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.080
his poor...

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:34.960
calculating ways.

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.600
I just think of it
as coaxing a child.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.960
Your child...

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.320
is quite hard to coax.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.720
Thanks to all of you,

00:27:45.721 --> 00:27:47.720
the company is able to achieve...

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.440
such amazing results
in a short time.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.040
Especially Lin Yan Rui.

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:52.536
Mr. Lin, thank you
for your hard work.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.560
No.

00:27:53.561 --> 00:27:55.256
It's because of the great leadership
from you guys.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.559
I'd like to thank
Mr. Wu and Mr. Chi...

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:57.800
for trusting and guiding me.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Thank you.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.160
Here. I suggest...

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.439
let's make a toast
to Mr. Wu and Mr. Chi. Okay?

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.920
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.120
Here.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.640
Bottoms up for me.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.256
Let's continue working hard
in the next half of the year.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.280
- Okay?
- Okay.

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.280
- Keep it up!
- Work hard!

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.720
- We can do this!
- Go for it!

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.039
Mr. Wu, Mr. Chi, I'll get going.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.040
Bye.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.280
Take care.

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.520
Okay. You guys should go too!

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.320
Mr. Wu, you're really rich now.

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:33.760
When I get rich,

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:35.519
I'll treat you...

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.880
to the best spicy hot pot in town.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.080
But Guo Cheng Yu hasn't had it yet.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:41.720
Guo Cheng Yu?

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.880
Hasn't he taken over
the family business?

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.400
Darn it.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.520
He hasn't slept with him yet?

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:01.960
What should we do then?

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.240
How about this?

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.079
Ask them out tomorrow.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.680
Let's put on an act
for Jiang Xiao Shuai.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.160
We'll put on an act,

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.520
and Jiang Xiao Shuai
will sleep with him.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.120
Will that work?

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.480
Don't worry.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.040
He'll surely thank you.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.360
Tell him to drink less beer.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.736
- Take his medicine on time.
- Yes.

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.160
Okay. I'll get going.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:40.800
You're here.

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.336
Take this medicine once
every two days.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.040
Take two pills each time
before meals.

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.840
Remember to drink less beer
next time.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.560
Don't smoke. Quit it if you can.

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:22.560
Sir.

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.280
What's wrong?

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.399
I want to break up...

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.520
with Chi Cheng.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.200
Why?

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:35.560
Could it be...

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:36.720
that love...

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
really can't withstand...

00:30:38.001 --> 00:30:39.840
the test of time?

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.320
What do you mean?

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:45.920
Do you think...

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.560
he's tired of me?

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.360
He's so impatient with me.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.200
Da Wei.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.640
Love is...

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:57.760
a delicate thing.

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.256
Sometimes, being hot and cold...

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.560
is just a moment's decision.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.160
Every man's androgenic hormone
secretion volume is different.

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.120
When you think
he's getting tired of you,

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.360
it's actually just
an external symptom...

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.480
of insufficient androgenic hormone
secretion volume.

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.600
It's fine, Da Wei.

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:17.520
Sir.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:22.640
You think you're so good.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.399
If I don't show my ultimate move,

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.520
it seems like it won't work.

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.400
Sir.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.120
If it's really like what you said,

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.759
the androgenic hormone secretion...

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:38.440
is too low.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.560
How did this happen?

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:46.920
Don't look at it.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.240
Did he hurt you?

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:52.560
Sir.

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.040
Lower your voice.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.520
There are other people here.

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.159
Last night,

00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.160
when I was sleeping,

00:31:59.161 --> 00:32:00.880
I accidentally kicked him
in the face,

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.480
and he complained that I'm dirty,

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:03.880
so I fought with him.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.840
Then he hit me.

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:07.120
Sir.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.200
As you know,

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.240
I can't defeat him.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:11.520
Darn it!

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.800
Who is he to say you're dirty?

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.200
We haven't even
held him accountable...

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.600
for all the dirty things he did.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:19.800
I can't believe he did that.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.880
He...

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.080
He often compares me to you too.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.200
He said I'm not as fit as you.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.240
He even said...

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:32.200
I'm not half as reserved as you.

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.080
He's just trying to make you angry.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.416
Don't stay at his place anymore.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.440
Stay at my place.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Let's see what he'll do.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.280
Thank you, Sir.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:46.880
He's not worth it.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.640
He's really not worth it.

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:00.280
All right.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:02.360
That's enough.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:09.880
It's okay.

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:12.640
It's all right.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.039
Okay, be good.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.440
Hugs for you.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.640
I'm suddenly craving
instant noodles.

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:35.080
(Contacts: Chi Cheng, Da Wei,
Guo Cheng Yu, Mr. Li, Qiu Qiu)

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:36.720
(Guo Cheng Yu)

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.400
Lend me your phone to order takeout.

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.720
Men are like menstruation.

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.480
It's annoying when it comes,

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.480
but you think about it
when it doesn't.

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:10.680
Xiao Shuai.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.040
Xiao Shuai.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:13.960
Xiao Shuai.

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.080
How is it going?

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.039
Xiao Shuai hasn't seen Cheng Yu...

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.040
for many days.

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.240
He must miss him.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.736
When the time comes,
you have to play along with me.

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.760
Do you hear me?

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.200
Wait. Your plan is too costly.

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:42.600
Wei Wei.

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.960
I'll give you one more day.

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:46.840
If you can't make it happen,

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.840
I'll drug Jiang Xiao Shuai...

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.400
and bring him to Guo Cheng Yu's bed.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.280
No.

00:34:52.281 --> 00:34:53.440
One day is too short.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.520
At least three days.
Three days, okay?

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.079
Anyway, I can put up
with you being away from me...

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:00.280
for three days at most.

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:01.680
See what you can do.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.400
Got it.

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.800
Da Wei, I need to use the toilet.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.080
Are you in there?

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.080
I don't want to live anymore!

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.480
Da Wei!

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.640
Da Wei, come out!

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.720
Da Wei.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.160
Why are you doing this, Da Wei?

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.679
- Da Wei, don't be stupid.
- Chi Cheng.

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:28.199
- You'd better do well,
- He's not worth it,

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.320
- or I'll kill you.
- Da Wei.

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.080
Chi Cheng, you bastard!

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.000
Do you know Da Wei almost died?

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.360
Is he dead?

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.800
If he is, would I still come to you?

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:46.519
If he's dead,
I'd get someone to stab you twice...

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:47.520
and bury you with him!

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.440
How did he die?

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:00.480
Tell me.

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.640
He almost drowned.

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.240
Did he do it for real...

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:08.760
and really choked in the water?

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.880
You and Guo Cheng Yu
haven't slept together yet, right?

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.480
You know what?

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.200
Someone you can't feel...

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.360
and touch...

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.480
is even more appealing.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.560
I also don't know why...

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.520
I want to sleep with everyone
who is with Guo Cheng Yu.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:46.800
Especially you.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.280
Your appeal...

00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:58.880
doesn't just attract Guo Cheng Yu.

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.960
You're making me feel tempted too.

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:05.960
Please go and see Wu Suo Wei first.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:09.080
He's in a really bad mood right now.

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.360
Okay.

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:14.280
As long as you tell me to,

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:15.680
I'm willing to do it.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:19.800
Let's go, Chi Cheng.

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.200
You didn't have to do it
for real, Wei Wei.

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.160
Stop freaking crying!

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:51.800
Chi Cheng.

00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.480
Da Wei.

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:00.920
Why don't you guys talk first?

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:01.960
I'm going out for a walk.

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:17.800
Stop crying!

00:38:17.801 --> 00:38:20.040
You don't care even if I cry.

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:21.680
Stand up!

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:27.200
Why are you working so hard?

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:29.760
I have a cold.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:30.880
I don't want to infect you.

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:33.560
How did you catch a cold?

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.200
I was in the bathtub
for too long yesterday.

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.560
You're really asking for trouble.

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.320
For you,

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:42.600
I'm willing to do anything.

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:44.880
Are you doing this for me?

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:46.640
You're torturing me.

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.080
Da Wei! What's wrong?

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.560
Chi Cheng, why did you hit me?

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.880
Chi Cheng, I'm going to kill you!

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.720
Chi Cheng, let go of him!

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.280
Xiao Shuai, don't blame him.

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:01.800
Blame me if you have to.

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.160
Chi Cheng is right.

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.520
I'm shameless.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:05.720
Yes, I'm a simp.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:06.760
I deserve to die.

00:39:06.761 --> 00:39:08.520
If I had half your reservedness,

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.600
I wouldn't have ended up like this,

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:11.680
Xiao Shuai.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.559
How dare you talk
to Da Wei like that?

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:14.560
Xiao Shuai!

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.040
Do you have a death wish?

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.920
What did he say that's wrong?

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:20.600
Simp?

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.000
Or that he's not reserved enough?

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.840
Let me freaking tell you, Chi Cheng.

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:31.560
I'm the shameless one.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.080
I'm the simp.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.640
I'm not freaking reserved at all!

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.280
I'm going to find Guo Cheng Yu now
and sleep with him!

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:39.520
Xiao Shuai!

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:40.520
Don't go.

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.120
Don't let Guo Cheng Yu sleep
with you.

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.439
If a man like Guo Cheng Yu gets you,

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.680
he won't cherish you anymore.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:48.000
Let this be a lesson for you,
Xiao Shuai.

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:49.880
Don't follow in my footsteps!

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.360
I'm going.

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:55.759
I want to see what will happen
after I sleep with Guo Cheng Yu.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:56.799
- Xiao Shuai!
- Wu Suo Wei.

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:57.800
Don't go.

00:39:58.920 --> 00:39:59.920
Let him go.

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:01.440
He doesn't have the guts to do it.

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:02.760
Chi Cheng.

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:04.800
Fine.

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:05.960
Just wait.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.400
Sir!

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.880
He's gone.

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.400
He's finally gone.

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:25.120
I guess...

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.560
I've finished the mission early.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.440
You're a good actor.

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:34.920
Tell me.

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.279
Could this be a trap...

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.400
your teacher set on purpose?

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:38.640
No.

00:40:38.641 --> 00:40:40.096
He doesn't have the brains
to come up with this.

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:41.120
You're right.

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.440
If he finds out,

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:45.720
he won't hold a grudge
against you, right?

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.816
Why would he hold
a grudge against me?

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:48.840
Back then,

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000
if it weren't for him,

00:40:50.001 --> 00:40:51.200
would I fall into your hands?

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:55.160
This is perfect.
Now, I'll let him have a taste...

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.440
of his own medicine.

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:57.800
At the same time,

00:40:57.801 --> 00:40:58.896
we'll let Guo Cheng Yu fix...

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.520
his gossiping habit.

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.640
- Here.
- Done.

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:06.840
Have you had your fun in acting?

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:11.840
Xiao Shuai.

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.280
Let me explain.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:14.360
What should I listen to?

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.400
That I don't have a brain
or that I'm a gossip?

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:19.440
Sir!

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.840
I'm doomed. It's all over.

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:26.920
All our efforts are in vain.

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.400
No.

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.680
Plan B.

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.280
Plan B?

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:33.560
Will it work?

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:43.160
Hello?

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.560
Cheng Yu!

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.159
Chi Cheng and I
originally wanted to make you...

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:49.000
and Xiao Shuai's happy life
even more blissful.

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:51.839
But I think we ruined it.

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:53.160
I'm sorry,

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.400
Cheng Yu.

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:55.800
I'm sorry.

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:56.880
Cheng Yu...

00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:58.280
Hello?

00:41:58.880 --> 00:41:59.880
Cheng Yu.

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:10.920
(Bonus Clip)

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:12.480
- It's a deal.
- It's a deal.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:14.680
You're so childish.

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:18.920
Look, that's our house.

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:20.680
Our house is over there.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.760
Why am I always the one
doing this kind of thing?
