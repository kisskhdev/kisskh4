[Episode 24]

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.580
If I may comment,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.620
I've fought those four

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.090
Foundation Establishment Blood Guards before.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.730
They are strong.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.980
Especially their Demonic Transformation.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.820
It allows them to ascend

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.410
to the next tier by brute force.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.450
Of course,

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.850
it is not without weaknesses.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.660
One, the transformation

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.980
requires one to enter a Blood Cocoon.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.260
That takes time.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.050
Two, upon transformation,

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.410
one will be overtaken by the thirst for blood

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:49.620
and lose all

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:50.740
rationality.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.180
We can exploit those two weaknesses.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.660
Do not forget that.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.620
We'll try to waste their time.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.490
My fellow sisters,

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.260
please stick to our plan.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.180
If things go awry,

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.180
quit fighting

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.020
and regroup with us immediately.

[Cold Palace]

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.900
Stay alert.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.850
Master is training in solitude.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.900
We have released Beguiling Mist in the palace.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.900
So don't fall into a deep slumber

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.130
like those mortals did.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.930
Those three scoundrels.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.060
Who do they think they are?

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.890
How dare they put me on watch duty?

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.450
The enemies will fall for our traps, they said.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.940
It's just an excuse to shirk.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.450
Once Master comes out,

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.220
I'll report them to him.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.130
What is this new gadget?

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.010
It's quite useful.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.730
I assembled it myself.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.380
It's more than enough to fight

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:44.780
weaker cultivators.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.940
I knew it. An ambush.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.610
Kill the messengers first.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:51.570
Don't alert others.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.690
How annoying.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.660
Alert others.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:41.220
Yes!

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.540

My Seniors in arms,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.700

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.900
and kill this demon.

Sure.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.100
A long fight is risky.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.530
Go transform now.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.130

Let's swap.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:24.700
Come.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.650
Today, I shall avenge

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.180
my lost arm.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:04.180
I can handle this.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.730
Stop him from transforming.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.010
All right.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:47.300
Meng,

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.130
watch out!

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:09.580
Bladestorm?

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:11.530
As expected of you, Jing.

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.770
Let me aid you.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.250
Regenerate if you want.

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:29.010
I'll just chop it off again.

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:34.100
Good.

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:35.530
Rage on.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:38.130
The transformation brings out your animalistic instincts.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.130
If he loses his humanity,

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:41.610
he'll be dead soon.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:43.730
Where are the two other Blood Guards?

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:47.700
Watch out!

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:56.580
Senior Song.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.980
Take care of the meathead.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:58.940
Sure.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:00.010
Chen Rong.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.420
This is bad.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.420
It is a very potent corpse venom.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:05.130
Here.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:18.820
I can't believe we met again.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.100
How have you been,

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:22.850
Han?

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.610
I see you used the Ascension Token to enroll in Yellow Maple Valley.

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:30.650
And you have reached mid-Foundation Establishment.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:32.460
You

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.130
lured rogue cultivators to join you at Tainan Bazaar.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:36.890
Thanks to you,

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.090
Wu Jiuzhi has turned to this.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.750
Fate keeps me alive

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:45.580
so that I can kill you.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.130
Enough.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:48.770
For what you did to Wan Xiaoshan,

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:50.650
we'll settle the score today.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:08.730
Go support Senior Liu.

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.770
Take care.

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:52.730
Like I said,

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.100
you are mine.

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:56.730
You're different from others.

00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:58.850
You fight like a martial artist.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.730
You are smart.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.890
I hail from the Song Clan of Hanzhou.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.820
We are a martial arts clan.

00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:09.980
Perhaps you

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.340
were also

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:12.580
a martial artist?

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.420
Cultivators like you claim to stay away from the mortal affairs.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:20.530
Yet the endless war in our world

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:23.420
is all orchestrated by the cultivation sects.

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:27.100
You claim to maintain peace.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:28.980
But in the end,

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.460
the mortals pay with their lives.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:32.610
You're neither a human nor a demon.

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:34.060
You don't have the right

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.460
to speak such insolent words

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:36.850
on behalf of all mortals.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.650
Scums from the Seven Sects,

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.460
die!

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:32.770
The art of spear

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:33.580
is about

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:34.250
blocking,

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:34.940
lifting,

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:35.770
stabbing,

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:36.770
parrying,

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:37.490
striking,

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.220
sweeping,

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.050
and thrusting.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:42.620
The same goes for the art of sword.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.290
The longer the weapon,

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.140
the stronger it is.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.010
Your reckless fighting technique

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:48.570
does no justice to your monstrous strength.

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:50.380
What a waste.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.250
You talk so much.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:04.730
We did it.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:08.330
Careful!

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:14.900
Chen Mu!

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:21.330
Chen Mu.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.530
Chen Mu.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.530
I'm sorry.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.420
You

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.530
must taste good too.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:02.860
Chen Mu.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:06.010
Chen Mu.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.420
Chen Mu.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.010
Chen Mu.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:40.980
One less useless ally

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.330
for you.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.330
Han,

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:44.380
make it quick.

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:45.380
I need your support.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:10.050
This is Pinggu's belonging.

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:16.620
Drop dead.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.490
I will crush you

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:32.700
with my bare hands!

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:02.140
Using his blood essence to activate his life-bound treasure?

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.180
Senior Liu is going all out.

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:13.290
You are quite durable.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:14.530
Tell me.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:15.810
What is your name?

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.570
If I'm in a good mood, I'll erect

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:18.490
a tombstone for you.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.570
I am Tie Luo, General of Lanzhou Cavalry.

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:21.770
I'll also be the man who takes your life.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:23.900
Stop hiding any tricks.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:27.900
Our foe is strong.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.330
The ice demon is dead.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.050
Transform now

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:32.380
and fight them

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.290
with me!

Good.

I don't have to intervene then.

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:16.660
Villain.

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:18.380
You cannot leave.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:24.660
What joy is there in life?

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.380

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:28.660
You cannot leave...

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.420
It defeated a mid-Foundation Establishment

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:43.810
demon in one blow.

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:45.460
As expected of a life-bound treasure.

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:46.290
However,

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:48.180
it also burned the mystic pouch to a crisp.

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:49.570
What a waste.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:51.940
Han.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.220
I consider

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.090
this match

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:54.900
a draw.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:08.980
Well done, Jing!

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:11.860
We've killed them all.

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:15.290
You would sacrifice

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:16.860
your life-bound treasure to kill demons.

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:18.330
How admirable.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.570
You flatter me, Han.

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:23.570
Don't

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:24.900
tell Weiniang about today.

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:29.180
I don't want her to worry.

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:32.570
Chen Mu.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.660
I didn't mean to kill you.

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:38.010
How am I supposed to face others now?

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:54.570
What am I supposed to do now?

00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:58.620
Their leader still lives.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.050
No one knows

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:02.050
if the worst will come.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:03.980
We can't leave him here.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:22.570
Chen Mu.

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:23.940
Forgive me.

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:31.530
Forgive me.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:32.530
Chen Mu.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:42.570
Senior Liu.

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:43.940
Senior Song.

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:45.330
Senior Han.

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:47.050
I'll tell

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:49.220
Qiaoqian about Chen Mu myself.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.290
Don't tell her for now.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:52.900
I don't want her to be distraught.

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:56.660
Of course.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.140
My condolences.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.420
Chen Mu,

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.050
let's go home.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.010
Let's go inside.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.810
Something is amiss.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.250
This might be their hideout.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:32.220
Over here.

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:03.290
Murong Qing.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.490
Zheng Tiannan.

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:05.180
Zhou Yan.

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:07.530
Chu Shanming.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:08.940
Zhang Wei.

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:10.140
Feng Wan'er.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:10.900
An Keqiao.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:11.860
Zhang Shuisheng.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:13.700
Murong Chu.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:14.940
These should be

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.380
the names of the victims.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:18.530
Meng Yuan.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:19.770
Murong Zhu.

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:22.490
Shen Qianxun.

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:26.180
A blood pool?

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.140
Jing.

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:42.570
Jing.

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:44.090
Are you all right?

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:46.290
Did you

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.090
have a flashback?

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.490
We can kill all dark cultivators and demonic sects.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:52.810
There will always be new ones.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.180
They can't be purged.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.460
You

00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:59.730
are too critical of yourself.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.860
It's all in the past.

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:04.570
We're no longer the trembling kids

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.700
in the dungeon.

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:09.700
We gained spirit roots

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.420
and became Foundation Establishment cultivators.

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:15.460
It's been so many years.

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:17.730
You are still my senior.

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:19.530
I'm still not as capable as you.

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:24.420
Your potential

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.050
is far superior to mine.

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.770
But you've been suppressing yourself.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:30.460
You ascend every time after I do

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:33.980
so that I don't feel inferior.

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:35.180
Right?

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:37.940
Just because you don't

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.330
say it out doesn't mean I wouldn't know.

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.090
Come on. That's not true.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.180
When it comes to cultivation,

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:49.700
there's no waiting for anyone else.

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.090
Also,

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:53.860
I'm not as thoughtful as you imagine.

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:57.010
No need to comfort me.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.180
The experiment those dark cultivators put me through

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:01.700
has damaged my constitution.

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.980
I might never reach the Core Formation Stage ever.

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.770
Weiniang and you have great potential.

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:16.380
Don't squander your talent away.

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.050
You

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.660
always make things up.

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:26.220
This is not fun.

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:28.460
I'll check on Han.

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:30.380
Thank you so much for what you've done, Song Meng.

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:55.940
What is going on?

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:57.090
There is no exit.

00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:48.220
Jing!

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:49.380
Weiniang.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:49.940
- Weiniang? - Qiaoqian.

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:53.730
How did you find this place?

00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:55.530
We chanced upon

00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:56.490
a contraption.

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.250
Then, we ran into the emperor

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.090
and took the secret passage here.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:01.570
The Black Fiend Cult

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:03.420
sure has done many things.

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:04.620
[Emperor Yue]
It digs deep.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:07.730
Greetings,

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.770
fellow cultivators.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.220
Thank you for rescuing me.

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:12.460
You're welcome.

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:14.980
It is our duty to kill dark cultivators.

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:18.460
There is a soporific array here.

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.090
All mortals will fall asleep.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.010
How do you stay awake?

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:23.810
And did you

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:25.330
run into

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.980
any pursuers?

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:29.330
Master,

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:30.220
I have

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:31.660
no idea at all.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.700
I stumbled upon

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.530
these two cultivators

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.570
and they woke me up.

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:38.980
They even gave me a pill.

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:40.250
Master,

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:41.860
are my

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:43.010
consorts

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:44.340
and ministers

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:46.210
all...

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:49.010
Are they all dead?

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:53.530
Han,

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:56.260
I did give him a sobering pill.

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:57.570
And we truly

00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.010
did not run into pursuers here.

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:04.820
Han,

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:06.690
the enemies still roam about.

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:08.570
Let's find more clues now.

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:10.300
Any delay will bring more variables.

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:11.780
Come with us.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.490
We can protect you.

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.130
Thank you.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:17.940
Weiniang,

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.420
please look after him

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:20.570
with Qiaoqian.

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:21.610
Don't worry about it, Jing.

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:22.860
Let's go.

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:48.130
Seniors.

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:51.460
There might be traps.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.050
What is this place?

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:13.300
What is this place?

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:15.130
I've

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.420
never been here either.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:55.170
Apologies for the lack of reception, my esteemed guests.

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.610
But since you're here,

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:01.210
there's no need to leave.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.900
Late Foundation Stage.

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.010
He is the leader of Black Field Cult.

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.340
Evil cultist.

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:16.300
Chen Rong!

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:41.210
Why did he attack

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:42.690
the weakest Chen Rong first?

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:46.130
Time to return them to their rightful owner.

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:48.650
Are they the Blood Condensing Five-Element Pills?

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:50.130
How come there are only four?

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.300
You shall not leave!

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:03.010
Come.

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.460
Where did he go?

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.050
He is a Late Foundation Stage cultivator.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.690
Why did he attack ruthlessly

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:41.490
as if he doesn't care about his life?

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:43.420
Unless

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.900
there's something wrong with the Blood Condensing Five-Element Pills?

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:54.980
Thank you.

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.340
You brought me

00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:59.300
the Blood Condensing Five-Element Pills.

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:00.980
Everything

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.940
is now in order.

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:06.980
One.

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:07.740
Two.

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:08.570
Three.

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:09.340
Four.

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.420
Who is the last Blood Condensing Five-Element Pill?

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:12.650
Tie Luo is metal.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:14.210
Qingwen is wood.

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.380
The ice demon is water.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:17.900
Wu Jiuzhi is earth.

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.780
He must be fire then.

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:21.130
Oh, no.

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.210
He is not the leader of the Black Fiend Cult,

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.010
but the last Blood Guard.

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:26.570
Where is

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:28.420
the real leader then?

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:50.340
Jing!

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.860
Jing!

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:51.380
Weiniang.

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:57.940
- Do not move. - Weiniang.

00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:00.130
Or he will die.

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:03.130
Jing.

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:05.210
I'm sorry.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.740
You have to show your face today.

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.460
Don't worry, my dear brother.

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.050
What's yours is mine.

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:16.130
Villains,

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:18.170
quit pretending.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:19.690
You sicken me!

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:20.820
Jing.

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:22.130
Stop speaking.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.610
Use your power to heal yourself now.

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:25.380
You're right.

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:28.650
He's

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:31.380
about to die.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.260
Surrender yourself.

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:38.490
Weiniang.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:51.900
