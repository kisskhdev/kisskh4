[Episode 8]

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.846
While we're already bound
by the betrothal arrangement,

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:42.890
I still wish to know you

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.120
better.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:45.490
I see

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.940
you're still averse to me.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.800
You think

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.000
you're above a man of my
lowly background, don't you?

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.530
Not at all.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.810
Then what?

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.600
Why are you afraid of me?

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.710
Senior Lu,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.490
there are people here.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.600
Behave.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.420
You're adorable when you're shy.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.510
There is no one here.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.010
Him again.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.110
Senior Lu.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.180
Why do you like to pick on him?

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.940
He picked on me first.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.370
His Foundation Pill

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.860
should have been mine.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.730
Han Li!

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.200
Stand right there!

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.840
Senior Lu,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.840
ever since I entered the valley,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.200
I have done nothing but concede.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.460
Why must you back me into a corner?

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.490
You know very well why.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.200
Give me back the Foundation Pill

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.690
or be the fertilizer to the forest.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.710
You've done nothing wrong

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.270
but you stick out like a sore thumb

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.490
because you possess
something you shouldn't have.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.920
What are you doing?

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.210
This is between him and me.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.410
Please stay out of this, Mentor Wu.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.220
I didn't teach you
magic to hurt your peers.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.260
Before I came here, I fought with my life

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.656
on the Tianwu Arena

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.240
before I was offered a Foundation Pill.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.060
Yet he simply

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.496
took my spot with a show
of his Ascension Token.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.166
It was only reasonable for me to be angry!

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.390
The Sect Master and the elders

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.450
decide who can have the Foundation Pill.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.350
If you have issues with
their decision, appeal to them.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.380
I want fairness!

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.510
The prestigious cultivators
already look down on me.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.270
He's just a rogue cultivator
with a fake spirit root.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.170
How come he gets to steal my thunder too?

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.336
You have accepted

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.820
the compensation gems we offered

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.040
so you're no longer entitled to the pill.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.690
You still have a chance
to get it in the future.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.800
Just work hard for it when the time comes.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.940
Senior Lu.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.850
Let's go.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.480
Let's not blow this out of proportion.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.080
Han Li.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.680
You will never

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
hear the end of me.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:58.606
You won't

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.410
be so lucky next time.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.400
Are you all right?

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.400
Thank you, Mentor Wu.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.730
He was right.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.400
You've done nothing wrong,

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.310
but you stick out like a sore thumb.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.410
There's only one way for you

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.470
to keep your Foundation Pill.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.336
Get to Tier 13 as soon as possible

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.360
and ingest it.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:41.630
It's the only way.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.120
Do I

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.540
not deserve the pill?

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.800
Senior Lu.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.580
Calm down, Senior Lu.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:29.830
Senior Lu.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.510
Calm down!

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.560
I am calm.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.216
You're digging your own grave here.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.410
I fought for that pill for you!

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.806
Only by reaching the Foundation Establishment
Stage that I am deserving of you.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:40.830
Senior...

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.580
Didn't they offer you 300
gems as compensation?

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:49.950
That's a lot.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.340
No need to take any tasks from me anymore.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.600
That's not compensation.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:54.930
It was a robbery.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:03.390
Mentor,

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.600
I was told

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.160
that you

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.750
know a way to obtain a Foundation Pill.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.410
I do.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.610
But it costs a lot.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.720
Are you

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.340
going to splurge?

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.190
300 gems.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.560
Take it.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.140
300 gems.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.806
You won't keep anything for yourself?

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:28.930
Gems are nothing

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.850
compared to a Foundation Pill.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.160
Wait for my good news.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.800
Thank you.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.880
Have you made up your mind?

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:09.430
Almost.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.050
Are you done?

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:23.980
Mentor,

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.480
ten books in total.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.170
Ten books.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:26.930
20 gems.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.590
Leave the gems here and you can go.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.780
18...

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.930
That's not good.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.020
18 gems.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:09.726
Leave one book behind.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:10.750
Take nine books.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.720
Mentor,

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:15.780
can you help me out?

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.360
No.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:19.930
It took me a while to pick those books.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:21.846
Perhaps when I...

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:22.870
Fine.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.576
Just this once.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.600
Don't do it again.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.800
Go.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:26.870
Thank you, Mentor.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:35.830
Don't move.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:39.290
If I

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:40.610
treat your swollen neck,

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:41.250
is my effort

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:42.630
worth two gems?

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.290
You can heal?

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.120
You never mention it.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.360
Have you been

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.780
ingesting supplements
imbued with the fire element?

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:05.630
No.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:06.870
No?

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.220
Perhaps I've spent

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.980
too much time at Dihuo Palace lately.

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:15.700
Not bad.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.200
You hide many tricks.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:22.490
It's swollen

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:23.750
because the heat

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:24.910
has pervaded your body.

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:26.030
I need to cut it open.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.486
I'll gather some poisonous herbs

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:28.510
and make a numbing soup.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.600
After you drink it,

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.840
it won't hurt when I cut it.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.080
Han Li.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.600
Come back.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.060
Just cut it open now.

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:41.980
No need to numb it.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.650
It's bothering me so much.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.840
Come.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:46.890
It's going to hurt a lot.

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.730
Not being able to sleep or eat is worse.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:50.960
Just do it.

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:53.510
Come.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:56.630
Hurry up.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.010
Liar.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:05.340
I can't

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:06.510
count on him at all.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:16.580
It hurts.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.960
Mentor.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.200
Come.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:44.390
Are you sure?

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.600
Listen.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:53.770
If you botch it,

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.100
I'll make you pay.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.240
It's true?

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:12.390
What is?

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:18.030
I've read that some patients

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.460
had a bird coming out of their shoulder.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.080
It hid under the skin

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
like a tumor

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:25.270
or a lump.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.470
You can hear a bird's chirping from within.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:28.340
When it's cold or hungry,

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:29.550
you'll feel pain.

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:32.750
Once one uses a silver
blade to slice its feet,

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.240
the bird

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:36.010

It's treated.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:20.390
Who would have thought

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.770
that you could heal too?

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.180
You have a knack

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.530
for medicine and herbs.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:28.630
Here.

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:29.990

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.720
Like I said,

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:47.710
curing your swollen
neck is to be remunerated

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:48.870
by two gems.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:50.530
Also,

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:51.790
I picked ten books,

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.480

If you need money,

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.720

[Tame a Beast]

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.180
But taming a beast

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:19.600
can be dangerous.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.460
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:22.890
If you're too scared for it,

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.200
there's this one.

Anything simpler for me?

I have no use for that many gems anyway.

Mentor Ye,

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.056
is the task at Herbs
Garden still available?

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.080
Can I take that one?

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.420
Do you know what kind of place it is?

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:54.890
I looked down once

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:56.100
when I was flying.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.770
I'm confident enough to carry out

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.180
a herb-gathering task.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.420
I have to warn you first.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.420
The herbs in the Herbs Garden

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:05.980
are more precious than the disciples here.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:08.890
If you destroyed one or two herbs,

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.650
you would have to pay

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.980
more than a few thousand gems.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.240
You don't trust me?

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:21.790
I would like

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:23.420
to give it a try.

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:28.060
A fool never heeds any warning.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.240
Pay up.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:33.630
I'm here to take up a task.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.180
Why do I have to pay you?

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:38.370
I take 10% of the reward as commission.

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:39.670
It's the rule here.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
What about other tasks?

Besides,

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.726
to make sure you can't walk
away should you destroy the herbs,

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:48.830
you need to pay a small fee

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.180
as security deposit to accept this task.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:56.770
You can't get anywhere without gems here.

Easy.

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:35.220
Don't you have a Foundation Pill?

Sell it to me.

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.460
Not only can you own a large amount of gems

but I will also offer you better tasks

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:42.940

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.120

Why does it matter?

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:57.060
You have a fake spirit root.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.816
You can never reach the Foundation
Establishment Stage in your life.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.290
1,7...

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.960
Oh, no.

00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:59.700
She's using a trick.

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:01.980
She's more powerful than I.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:03.920
I must leave.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.480
Wait.

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:08.790
What is it?

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:14.920
What are you doing?

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:16.460
Stay still.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.730
Let me look at you.

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:21.250
You look plain.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:23.530
Your talent is also ordinary.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.490
But you have great eyes.

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:27.790
Very clear.

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:30.700
Miss,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000
take care.

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:37.070
You don't like people looking at you?

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.700
I don't like to be stared at.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.240
Your stare

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.900
makes me uncomfortable.

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:49.090
Do you get nervous when you see me?

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:51.220
Don't worry.

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:52.416
In this garden,

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.860
other than herbs,

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:55.360
you hardly find any humans here.

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:56.510
Relax.

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:58.270
Don't move.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.380
No. 91 on the rare insect
list, Chelonian Beetle.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:05.940
Look at its long horn.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.856
Its black and white horn points at the sky.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:08.880
How strong.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.940
And look at its fine hair

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.180
that gives out a green
hue under the sunlight.

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:13.900
It's beautiful.

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:15.250
It's like a war general.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.400
What rare insect list?

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.010
Even insects have a ranking?

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.620
That's right.

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:32.286
If there is a ranking for cultivators,

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:34.090
the bugs and the plants can have one too.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:36.380
Don't underestimate this garden.

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:38.420
There's more than meets the eye.

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:42.270
Indeed.

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:44.250
This cultivation sanctuary

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:45.860
is otherworldly.

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:52.790
What was the last number again?

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:56.550
I lost count.

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.320
Can you stop staring at me?

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:04.290
One.

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:05.250
Two.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.730
But weren't we born to be admired?

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.250
Look at the bugs and the plants.

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:11.770
They don't care about us,

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:12.980
so they are happy.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.880
You shouldn't care if others
are looking at you or not.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.730
This garden

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.400
has a lot of eccentric people.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.220
I don't want any attention.

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:26.510
That said,

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:28.910
she seems to be quite
familiar with this place.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:30.950
Perhaps I can learn from her.

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:36.790
Greetings.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
I am Han Li.

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:39.250
How may I address you?

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.530
Oh, you're the one with
the Ascension Token.

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:45.770
I don't mean to look down at you.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.240
I am Dong Xuan'er.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:48.980
We're now friends.

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:51.900
Miss,

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.420
do you work in this garden as well?

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:55.770
She is the Dong Xuan'er.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.980
No one can order her around.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:25:59.900
Mentor Ma.

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:01.030
Mentor Ma.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:01.810
Good.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.620
Since you two have met,

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.130
I don't need to make a lengthy

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:06.160
introduction.

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:07.380
This is Han Li.

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:08.290
Dong Xuan'er

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.050
is different from others.

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:11.770
She is the direct disciple

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:13.590
of a Core Formation Stage cultivator.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:14.250
She

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:15.810
sees things differently

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.730
in comparison to you.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:18.730
Don't waste

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:20.140
your time with her.

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:23.030
Understood.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.380
This is an excellent bug.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.680
What do you think?

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.880
It is good.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.900
Raise it for another decade or so

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.090
and it will become grade 2.

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.860
Keen eyes.

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:44.620
The universe is predestined

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.566
as countless lives were
brought to this world.

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:47.380
They exist,

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:48.980
so we should learn to admire them.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.440
Don't you think so?

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Han Li.

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:07.430
She sees the beauty in everything.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.440
Perhaps

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.440
this is another way of cultivating too.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.400
This garden

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:16.920
is wonderful.

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:18.750
I love it.

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:28.140
How is your day?

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:30.530
You don't look happy.

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:34.140
Be happy.

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:37.310
Mentor Ma.

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:38.660
How many

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.290
did you count today?

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:42.766
If we count the ones on the surface,

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:44.380
there are 7,123 plants.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:47.290
If we include Jade Wyrm
Root that grows underground,

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:48.250
we have

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.140
7,177 plants here.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.860
Wrong.

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:55.920
I counted twice.

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:57.070
I am very sure.

00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:58.830
Seven thousand,

00:27:58.920 --> 00:27:59.460
one hundred,

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:01.050
and eighty-two plants.

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:03.550
Impossible.

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:04.980
Impossible.

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:06.310
That's impossible.

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:09.590
There are five plants

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.680
in my hands.

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:18.770
Anyway, you passed.

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:19.880
Take them.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.250
You

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.440
barely pass.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:23.920
Thank you, Mentor Ma.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.180
Can I stay here?

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:27.730
Mentor Ma,

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:29.250
I've tended to herbs before.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.880
Please be reassured.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.980
Wait here.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:43.880
Don't gawk.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:13.940
Han Li,

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:15.270
come here.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.620
I told you that if you killed

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.330
any plants,

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.180
you'd have to pay.

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:25.486
Did you have a backup plan

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:26.510
in your mind already?

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:27.790
I'll do my best.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.290
Good.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:30.900
Write down anything.

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:32.310
Anyway,

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:33.350
take care of this garden.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.920
I'm going to cultivate in isolation.

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:36.430
You can stay here for the moment.

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:37.810
It makes it easier

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.080
for you to manage this place.

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:40.700
I'll return

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:41.880
after one season.

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:43.110
After we harvest them,

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:44.810
you will be rewarded

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.090
with plenty of gems.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.640
Do you understand?

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:49.246
Please put your mind at ease, Mentor Ma.

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:50.270
Also,

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.180
do not disturb me.

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:09.550
Mentor Ye!

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.240
Mentor Ye!

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:15.460
Where did that old man go?

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:24.656
He's often away during the day.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.620
I see he has been tinkering with puppets.

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:28.806
It seems like he is adept

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:30.290
in puppetry.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:33.730
This is huge.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.010
Wow.

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:37.940
I won't be able to defeat
him when I fight him.

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:40.660
That ancient fool.

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:43.420
You're so early.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.290
Are you here to snatch up new tasks?

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.200
Mentor Ye,

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.200
I heard

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.980
you have obtained a Foundation Pill.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.420
I came to thank you.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.180
Why thank me?

00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:59.140
An ancient fool like me made a promise

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.420
to a fledgling fool like you.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:02.940
Then

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:04.136
when can I

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.730
have the pill?

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:07.050
Be patient.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.200
Just wait.

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:13.616
The disciples will be arriving soon

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.640
to accept new tasks.

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:17.486
If you don't mind that they
find out about this deal,

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:18.510
you can wait for me here.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Once they are gone,

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:21.070
I'll let you know.

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:22.180
Come in.

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:23.420
Come get your tasks.

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:25.140
Morning, Mentor Ye.

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.240
Morning.

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:29.530
Pick whatever task

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:30.720
you like.

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:35.220
Which idiot

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.680
took the task in Herbs Garden?

Does he not know how odd Mentor Ma is?

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:41.220
Or how dangerous the herbs are?

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:43.010
Who else can it be?

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.480
Who?

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:46.050
The one with the Ascension Token.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.440
So he took it.

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.720

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:56.070
This garden

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.440
is no different from the
garden in Shenshou Valley.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.200
It's only bigger in scale.

Water the root and not the leaves.

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:11.420
You need eight hours of sun.

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:21.460
Looking after these plants

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.416
feels so much better than hanging out

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.090

The sun is bright.

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:40.940
Soak it in.

It seems like

not only are you good
with the art of healing,

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:04.820
you have a talent

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.120
for herbal horticulture too.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:07.800
Not bad.

Mentor Wu,

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:16.430
I merely make use of what I have.

Sure. Come.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.400
That feels great.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.800
That's the spot.

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:52.070
Tell me honestly.

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:53.206
What techniques

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:54.530
do you want this time?

I'm not talented

00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:59.670
and I joined late.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.280
I have too many things

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:02.400
that I want to learn.

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.320
Done.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.480
Okay.

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:25.190
I'll teach you

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.880
this technique today.

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:29.590
Watch carefully.

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:38.780
This is Freeze.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.130
This is Quicksand.

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:56.130
Don't underestimate these two tricks.

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:58.460
When used by someone powerful enough,

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.820
acres of land can turn into desert.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.780
Raging rivers can turn into glaciers.

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:05.960
Try it.

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:26.816
Not bad

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:27.840

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:28.650
Don't rush it.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.340
The efficiency of your spell

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:32.166
depends on

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:33.340
your ability

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:34.940
and your proficiency.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.440
You are not talented,

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:37.710
but you're diligent.

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.280
In time,

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:40.590
it will pay off.

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:44.030
Thank you, Mentor.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.400
Also,

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.480
when do I come back next?

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:53.150
As often as you want.

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:54.550
All right.

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.780
Practice the spells regularly.

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:18.300
Not too shabby.

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:20.340
You've tended to the garden well.

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.090
It's all thanks to your notes.

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:27.090
I merely replicated them.

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:28.710
Besides, the weather helped me

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000
to achieve

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.320
the results too.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:39.880
Mentor,

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:41.650
since you know herbs so well,

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.130
surely you're well-versed

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.440
in alchemy too.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.980

00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:59.510
I suppose

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:00.610

my question.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:09.606
If you have the time

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:11.460
to study these things,

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.240
it means you have too
much time on your hands.

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:19.610
Mentor,

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.530
will you give me a few recipes?

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.400
Truth be told,

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:24.760

You

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:34.610
are asking for too much.

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:36.230
I spent more than a decade

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:37.570
to come up

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.490
with those recipes.

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:42.530
I can't give them to you for free.

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:44.230
Even rough drafts will do.

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:45.870
I can experiment with them myself.

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:53.740

But the real challenge

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:00.840
is.

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.090
