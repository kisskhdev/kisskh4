The Nice Guy

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:45.212
THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL,
AND THE PERSONS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:46.505
SETTINGS AND EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
SERIES HAVE BEEN FICTIONALLY CREATED

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:47.714
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:48.924
WITH THE CONSENT OF
AND IN THE PRESENCE OF GUARDIANS

00:00:52.928 --> 00:00:55.681
I haven't enjoyed
a night view like this in a long time.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:59.810
Everyone's living hard.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:04.106
Have you made up your mind?

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.734
Yes, I'll finish him once and for all.

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:13.282
Once you're done with the job,

00:01:13.365 --> 00:01:16.660
keep a low profile for about a month,
and turn yourself in.

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:20.455
And don't worry, okay?

00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:36.471
Anyway, don't you want to know
who you're supposed to finish?

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:40.475
Who is it?

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:44.187
Kang Taehoon.

00:02:08.462 --> 00:02:10.339
If you have something to say, say it.

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:13.592
Let me enjoy the special Americano first.

00:02:20.057 --> 00:02:21.433
So, you no longer work at Nilbana?

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:24.770
Do you still sing?

00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:26.855
Did you stop?

00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:30.442
Because of me?

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:33.904
Yes.

00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:35.906
I knew it.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.326
You sure have a knack
for embarrassing people.

00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:41.953
I don't do this to anyone.

00:02:45.624 --> 00:02:46.708
Okay, fine.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.170
It was my mistake.

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:52.214
I mistreated you unintentionally.

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:55.217
I'd never met a woman like you before.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.885
If it felt too aggressive...

00:02:58.804 --> 00:03:00.430
It must've felt aggressive.

00:03:03.642 --> 00:03:04.643
I apologize.

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:09.022
If you're done talking, let me--

00:03:09.106 --> 00:03:10.190
No, wait.

00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:16.655
This is not who I am,
but you keep making me look bad.

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:23.161
Fine. It's all good.
Let's just talk about life, then.

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:29.376
I heard your mother is unwell.

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.212
She stays at a nursing home.

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:34.256
What does she have?

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:38.009
What are you talking about?

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:39.761
How did you find that out?

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:42.848
How?

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:46.351
I find everything out
about the people I like.

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:48.395
It's what I'm good at.

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:52.566
Why do you

00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:55.944
ask for trouble in life?

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:57.571
You can choose an easy life.

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:00.615
Look.

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:04.786
I don't want to buy my dream
with someone else's money.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.872
I don't want to hear such a thing again.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.542
And don't ever visit me like this again.

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:19.718
This is hard.

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:31.521
I hear you're dating Seokcheol.

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:38.195
I know him well.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.447
I know what he's like.

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:43.617
When he suffers, he endures it to the end.

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:45.911
But he can't watch others suffer.

00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:49.748
He tends to be very enthusiastic
about other people's business.

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:52.000
Miyoung.

00:04:53.502 --> 00:04:56.171
If you keep this up,
I may take it out on him.

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:03.512
Don't make me mess with
my dear friend's life.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.389
What are you talking about?

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:09.142
It means

00:05:10.227 --> 00:05:12.229
you may catch up with Seokcheol's life.

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:14.272
SAMJUN E&amp;C

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:16.858
Think wisely about what's right.

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:58.149
- Welcome.
- Hello.

00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:00.110
Well...

00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:03.572
Oh.

00:06:10.287 --> 00:06:11.288
Miyoung.

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:24.551
What is it? Did something happen?

00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:29.222
What's wrong? Why do you look so serious?

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:34.853
I'm just tired because I had to deal with
a lot of picky customers today.

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:37.731
Maybe I got a bit emotional
when I saw you.

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:39.190
I'll clean up and come out.

00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:42.193
Is that all?
Are you sure nothing happened?

00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:44.362
Yes, that's all.

00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:47.157
- I'll hurry out.
- Okay.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:14.517
- We're here.
- You're right.

00:07:19.898 --> 00:07:21.066
Head inside.

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:24.319
- After I see you off.
- No, after you.

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:25.862
After you.

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:37.749
<i>I know him well.</i>

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:40.085
I know what he's like.

00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:45.924
When he suffers, he endures it to the end.

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:48.385
<i>But he can't watch others suffer.</i>

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.519
What?

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:01.022
- Seokcheol.
- Yes?

00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:04.401
What you told me before.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.486
Do you still mean it?

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:08.530
What exactly?

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:11.157
You said if someone harassed me,

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.494
you'd do the same.

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:17.580
Do you still mean it?

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:20.792
Of course.

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:22.877
Always.

00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:36.057
Will you stay the night with me today?

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.112
The Nice Guy

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:54.117
SEOKCHEOL

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.202


00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:04.794
SEOKKYUNG

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:15.513
Grandma, the flowers have bloomed
on Mom's tree.

00:09:15.597 --> 00:09:18.183
You're right.

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:21.686
Goodness. Summer will be here soon.

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:25.607
- Right. And Mom will come home soon.
- What?

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:30.403
I prayed that Mom would come home
when flowers bloomed on her tree.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.085
Hyeonggeun.

00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:48.088
Look here.

00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:50.006
Amazing.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:51.216
One more time.

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:53.510
You look great.

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:56.096
Goodness, my puppy.

00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:58.056
- How adorable.
- I'm home.

00:09:58.932 --> 00:09:59.933
Hey.

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:01.810
Hello.

00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:03.186
What are you doing, Hyeonggeun?

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:06.147
I'm taking care of Mom's tree
so it will put out a lot of flowers.

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:07.232
I see.

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:10.360
You sure are the most devoted child
in our family.

00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:13.488
I hope you stay devoted forever.

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:40.890
Come in.

00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:45.103
Going out again?

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:47.105
Yes, I need to go to work.

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:49.274
- You must be busy.
- Yes.

00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:53.194
You got a girlfriend?

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:57.740
Yes.

00:10:58.867 --> 00:10:59.868
Be good to her.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:04.581
Father.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.083
Was there something you wanted to tell me?

00:11:10.044 --> 00:11:12.213
No. I'll see you later. Bye.

00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:26.436
SEOKCHEOL

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:31.858
Oh.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.403
Hi, Seokcheol. Are you on the way?

00:11:35.486 --> 00:11:37.280
Yes, I'm on my way to work.

00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:38.364
<i>To work?</i>

00:11:38.448 --> 00:11:40.867
Jeez, you're such a diligent gangster.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.660
What?

00:11:43.161 --> 00:11:44.954
<i>You're a super diligent gangster.</i>

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:48.708
You go to work every day,
you hardly drink,

00:11:48.791 --> 00:11:50.835
<i>- and your hobby is reading.</i>

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:53.421
<i>You're a gentleman to women.</i>

00:11:53.504 --> 00:11:55.089
Like a perfect model student.

00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:57.217
"A perfect model student"?

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.260
Yes, a perfect model student.

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:01.804
I see. Thanks.

00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:07.060
Can you pick me up at the agency
after work today?

00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:08.895
<i>Let's go eat something good.</i>

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:10.230
Okay, I'll do that.

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:11.981
Good.

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:14.108
- Have a nice day.
<i>- Thanks.</i>

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:37.382
<i>Don't make me mess with</i>
<i>my dear friend's life.</i>

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.510
It means

00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:43.680
you may catch up with Seokcheol's life.

00:12:44.722 --> 00:12:47.934
SAMJUN E&amp;C

00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:49.727
<i>Think wisely.</i>

00:12:58.778 --> 00:12:59.779
CEO KANG TAEHOON

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.041
Hello?

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:15.670
Hello?

00:13:16.587 --> 00:13:18.172
<i>This is Kang Miyoung.</i>

00:13:22.844 --> 00:13:24.929
I didn't expect to hear from you so soon.

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.307
<i>I have something to tell you.</i>

00:13:28.349 --> 00:13:29.350
You can say anything

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:31.227
and everything.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:36.149
Take back the rude things
you told me yesterday.

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:37.984
Take them all back.

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:40.987
This is disappointing.

00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:44.240
This isn't what I wanted to hear.

00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:46.200
<i>Don't expect anything from me.</i>

00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:49.579
Nothing you expect is going to happen.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.248
Then, I won't take back my words.

00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:55.209
If anything happens to Seokcheol,

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:57.920
I won't just sit back.

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:09.640
She must have mustered up her courage
to challenge me.

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:33.998
Mom.

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:35.792
Mom!

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:00.942
No, Seokkyung.

00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:04.153
No.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.407
Pull yourself together, Seokkyung.

00:15:14.413 --> 00:15:16.415
MYOUNGSAN HOSPITAL

00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:18.334
Thank you.

00:15:24.048 --> 00:15:25.133
Ms. Seokhee.

00:15:26.342 --> 00:15:27.343
One moment, please.

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:34.809
What is it?

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.939
Did something happen to you yesterday?

00:15:40.022 --> 00:15:42.108
I tried to reach you so many times.

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:45.862
I had a drink. I didn't know you called.

00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:48.781
You could've texted me at least once.

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.117
Who did you go drinking with?

00:15:51.909 --> 00:15:53.286
Who answered my call yesterday?

00:15:54.704 --> 00:15:56.122
- A patient.
- A patient?

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:57.540
Which patient?

00:15:58.916 --> 00:16:00.126
Just someone.

00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:05.339
Don't tell me it's that weird patient
from the other day with many problems.

00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:06.674
That jujitsu fighter or whatever?

00:16:07.675 --> 00:16:09.886
What about you? What did you do yesterday?

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:12.430
Me?

00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:15.725
I told you I had a reunion yesterday.

00:16:16.267 --> 00:16:17.643
Why bring that up now?

00:16:19.228 --> 00:16:22.106
Because I wanted to see
what answer you'd give me.

00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:25.818
Is the director's daughter
your college friend?

00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:29.280
You may enter from now on.

00:16:29.947 --> 00:16:32.200
<i>I saw you enter</i>
<i>the concert hall together.</i>

00:16:33.701 --> 00:16:38.873
Kihong, I expected
you'd never lie to me, at least.

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:41.876
When you put off
our studies abroad together,

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:43.294
I thought you had your reasons.

00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:46.047
I believed it when you said
you'd marry me after that.

00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:51.219
But I don't know anymore.
I'm confused.

00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:56.390
Are you putting off our studies abroad
or our marriage?

00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:06.609
Is it difficult to answer?

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:09.654
Seokhee.

00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:13.491
You're greatly mistaken
about this one.

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:17.119
Yes, I did meet the director's daughter,

00:17:17.745 --> 00:17:20.289
but I told her that I was engaged.
I met her to let her know.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.959
Do you think I'd believe that?

00:17:24.168 --> 00:17:27.088
Should the three of us talk in person?
Let's do that if you want.

00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:28.589
Don't make me miserable.

00:17:29.298 --> 00:17:30.633
I don't deserve such treatment.

00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:32.093
Seokhee.

00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:40.768
Let's stop here.

00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:45.356
What are you talking about?

00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:47.650
Let's break up.

00:17:48.442 --> 00:17:49.944
Let's stop hurting each other.

00:17:53.447 --> 00:17:54.448
Seokhee.

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:17.888
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- I'm not in the mood to talk to you.

00:18:18.472 --> 00:18:21.475
- I'm hanging up.
<i>- Hey. I'm moving out.</i>

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:23.686
- What?
<i>- I'm moving out.</i>

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:26.606
I'm calling because I felt
I should at least let you know.

00:18:26.689 --> 00:18:31.319
I'm going to pick up Hyeonggeun
after school and leave with him.

00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:34.572
<i>- Seokkyung.</i>
- What?

00:18:34.655 --> 00:18:36.449
He's obviously not at school right now.

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:38.868
<i>You seriously have no idea.</i>

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:39.952
What?

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:41.787
Is he not?

00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:42.872
Well, then,

00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:45.625
I'll sneak in and take him from home.

00:18:45.708 --> 00:18:48.753
Father will be wide awake.
As if that's going to work.

00:18:48.836 --> 00:18:51.130
<i>He could really kill you for it.</i>

00:18:53.257 --> 00:18:54.467
Damn it.

00:18:54.884 --> 00:18:56.761
Then, you bring him out for me.

00:18:56.844 --> 00:18:58.846
<i>I'm not insane.</i>

00:18:58.929 --> 00:19:01.515
Stop this, and check the cupboard.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.602
- Why?
<i>- You'll find calming pills there.</i>

00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:07.271
Take one and lie down on the couch
with your hands together.

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:09.982
As if.
I have no reason to take a calming pill.

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:12.109
<i>And it's not going to change anything.</i>

00:19:12.902 --> 00:19:16.489
I'm going back to the gambling house.
End of discussion.

00:19:16.572 --> 00:19:19.659
Go ahead and do that.
Seokcheol and I will find you again.

00:19:19.742 --> 00:19:23.079
<i>Actually, this time,</i>
<i>we'll bring Byeongsoo along too.</i>

00:19:23.746 --> 00:19:24.914
Damn it.

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.875
Whatever. I'm hanging up!

00:19:30.544 --> 00:19:32.963
Goodness gracious!

00:19:33.047 --> 00:19:34.382
My life's a mess.

00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:37.802
So, is this how you're going to behave?

00:19:38.886 --> 00:19:39.887
Fine.

00:19:40.554 --> 00:19:42.098
I'll let you meet Hyeonggeun.

00:19:42.765 --> 00:19:43.891
Just wait there.

00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:52.942
Gosh.

00:19:58.322 --> 00:20:01.075
- Hi, Seokhee.
<i>- Mom, what are you doing?</i>

00:20:01.158 --> 00:20:03.369
- Cleaning, of course.
<i>- What about Dad?</i>

00:20:03.452 --> 00:20:05.162
He stepped outside with Daegi.

00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:06.288
<i>What's up?</i>

00:20:06.372 --> 00:20:08.541
I'm calling because I miss you.

00:20:08.624 --> 00:20:11.127
<i>If you do, why don't you come by sometime?</i>

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.546
Things are so hectic these days.

00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:16.966
I work overtime every day,
and all I do at home is sleep.

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:19.385
I can't even do my laundry

00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:20.678
or even wash the dishes.

00:20:21.637 --> 00:20:23.931
That's not good. It could become a habit.

00:20:24.473 --> 00:20:27.393
- And it won't help your marriage.
<i>- I have you.</i>

00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:31.021
Mom, could you come over
and clean the house for me?

00:20:31.105 --> 00:20:33.899
<i>- Jeez, I'm not your housekeeper.</i>

00:20:33.983 --> 00:20:35.443
Please.

00:20:35.526 --> 00:20:38.070
Oh, and bring me
some seasoned perilla leaves too.

00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:39.530
I've run out of side dishes too.

00:20:39.613 --> 00:20:42.032
Goodness gracious.

00:20:42.116 --> 00:20:44.118
- Fine.
<i>- Thanks, Mom.</i>

00:20:44.201 --> 00:20:46.746
- I'll text you the door code.
<i>- Okay.</i>

00:20:46.829 --> 00:20:48.706
- Are you going to come alone?
<i>- Why?</i>

00:20:49.957 --> 00:20:50.958
Well,

00:20:51.709 --> 00:20:54.295
it could be too exhausting for you.

00:20:54.378 --> 00:20:57.673
What could be that exhausting?
Do you have that much laundry to do?

00:20:58.382 --> 00:21:01.427
That's not it. I'm just worried
it might be too much for you.

00:21:01.969 --> 00:21:04.054
Oh, come with Daegi's wife.

00:21:05.139 --> 00:21:07.433
Okay, I'll do that. Bye.

00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:08.517
Bye.

00:21:16.734 --> 00:21:18.152
Damn it.

00:21:18.861 --> 00:21:21.155
They were supposed to give you a month.

00:21:21.238 --> 00:21:23.991
Banks can never be trusted after all.

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:27.077
Goodness. Tick, this punk.

00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:28.913
He sounded as if everything was settled.

00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:34.460
Is Tick's business doing well?

00:21:34.543 --> 00:21:36.045
Well, you know what he's like.

00:21:36.629 --> 00:21:40.007
He always whines,
but he never forgets to take his share.

00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:44.428
Don't tell me

00:21:45.012 --> 00:21:47.515
you're going to borrow money from him.

00:21:50.017 --> 00:21:51.268
Oh, boy.

00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:55.397
You've never borrowed money
from any of your juniors.

00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:56.482
How come...

00:21:57.691 --> 00:21:59.819
Haven't you heard from Seokkyung yet?

00:21:59.902 --> 00:22:01.320
Don't even bring her up.

00:22:02.279 --> 00:22:03.280
Look.

00:22:03.739 --> 00:22:07.159
Should I ask the boys to look for her?

00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:09.537
You know I'm an expert at finding people.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.413
There's no need. Tsk!

00:22:11.497 --> 00:22:14.542
If she's forced to come back,
she'll run away again.

00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:17.753
If she ever comes back,
it has to be her decision.

00:22:17.837 --> 00:22:20.172
- What will you do if--
- You know what I'll do.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.883
I'll break her leg at least.

00:22:26.053 --> 00:22:27.137
Where are you going?

00:22:27.596 --> 00:22:30.099
I'm going to Seokhee's house with Maksoon.

00:22:30.516 --> 00:22:31.600
Her house is a mess.

00:22:31.684 --> 00:22:33.561
I'm off to clean with her.

00:22:34.562 --> 00:22:35.563
Be careful on the way.

00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:39.108
- Be careful when you park.
- Okay.

00:22:45.489 --> 00:22:47.491
Mr. Chairman, they called.

00:22:49.076 --> 00:22:50.828
They'd like to talk to you in person.

00:22:59.545 --> 00:23:01.255
Sir. Two, please.

00:23:01.338 --> 00:23:02.715
Okay. Two stews here.

00:23:04.592 --> 00:23:05.968
- Take a seat here, sir.
- Okay.

00:23:07.595 --> 00:23:10.431
Anyway, why isn't Dusik around
all day today?

00:23:10.514 --> 00:23:12.808
- He's out for offsite duty.
- Offsite duty?

00:23:12.892 --> 00:23:14.977
Is he at an arcade again? Call him now.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.813
I'm not lying. He's with Mr. Sangyeol.

00:23:18.772 --> 00:23:20.149
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

00:23:26.947 --> 00:23:28.991
- Enjoy, sir!
- Thanks.

00:23:29.074 --> 00:23:30.367
- Enjoy.
- Sit down. Sit.

00:23:30.451 --> 00:23:31.952
I'm saying it's right.

00:23:40.961 --> 00:23:43.422
Try not to eat all together.

00:23:43.505 --> 00:23:45.549
It's not like we've rented
this whole place.

00:23:45.633 --> 00:23:47.051
There are no places like this.

00:23:47.134 --> 00:23:50.971
Seeing a group of us like that
makes people uneasy and leave.

00:23:51.055 --> 00:23:53.265
- We should eat here.
- Yes, sir.

00:23:53.349 --> 00:23:54.850
I had too much soju.

00:23:55.601 --> 00:23:58.187
Tell me what you'll have,
and I'll place your order.

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:01.565
What is he doing here? Why is he here?

00:24:02.775 --> 00:24:05.319
Oh, him? That guy's so stubborn.

00:24:05.402 --> 00:24:07.780
Every time we have a meal,
he keeps doing that.

00:24:10.699 --> 00:24:12.076
Damn.

00:24:17.665 --> 00:24:19.083
What did I tell you before?

00:24:19.541 --> 00:24:22.211
I told you to stay away
until you place within the 10th rank.

00:24:23.629 --> 00:24:24.630
Have you?

00:24:25.673 --> 00:24:28.008
It's impossible to place within the 10th.

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:35.933
Have you even given it a try?

00:24:37.518 --> 00:24:38.519
Yes, sir.

00:24:38.602 --> 00:24:40.813
I've tried it, and it's impossible.

00:24:41.981 --> 00:24:42.982
What's your rank?

00:24:43.649 --> 00:24:44.775
It's gotten five places higher.

00:24:44.858 --> 00:24:46.652
- In your class?
- No.

00:24:47.444 --> 00:24:49.238
- In school.
- Wooseok.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.534
Thank you for remembering my name.

00:24:56.036 --> 00:24:57.746
- Yes, Wooseok.
- Huh?

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.040
Good job. I'm proud of you.

00:25:00.958 --> 00:25:02.501
See? You can actually do it.

00:25:03.168 --> 00:25:04.503
You have potential.

00:25:04.586 --> 00:25:06.422
Keep studying like this, okay?

00:25:07.172 --> 00:25:08.799
Now, go and study.

00:25:08.882 --> 00:25:10.509
- You're talented. Go on.
- Wait.

00:25:12.219 --> 00:25:14.555
No. I want to be like you.

00:25:14.638 --> 00:25:16.348
No matter what you say...

00:25:18.183 --> 00:25:20.185
...I'll devote my life to this.

00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:21.437
Please let me in.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.897
Damn, this is embarrassing.

00:25:27.443 --> 00:25:28.444
Do you drink coffee?

00:25:29.028 --> 00:25:30.320
Yes, sir.

00:25:41.749 --> 00:25:43.083
Sit down, you punk.

00:25:51.258 --> 00:25:53.135
What was your childhood dream?

00:25:53.218 --> 00:25:54.553
Not just being a gangster.

00:25:56.764 --> 00:25:57.848
A baseball player.

00:25:59.433 --> 00:26:01.393
I was a baseball player
until middle school.

00:26:04.063 --> 00:26:05.314
What was your position?

00:26:07.441 --> 00:26:08.442
A shortstop.

00:26:09.234 --> 00:26:10.486
And a second baseman.

00:26:13.906 --> 00:26:15.199
Did you like baseball?

00:26:20.913 --> 00:26:21.914
Yes.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:27.628
But I quit after middle school.

00:26:31.048 --> 00:26:32.049
Why?

00:26:34.927 --> 00:26:36.595
I got a hole in my gloves.

00:26:38.013 --> 00:26:40.182
I couldn't ask my family
to buy a new pair.

00:26:40.849 --> 00:26:42.059
So, I quit.

00:26:43.811 --> 00:26:44.978
Wooseok.

00:26:45.854 --> 00:26:46.855
Yes?

00:26:46.939 --> 00:26:49.566
You may expect something
from this line of work,

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:50.984
but there's nothing here.

00:26:53.946 --> 00:26:56.115
There's nothing you're looking for.

00:26:57.366 --> 00:26:58.617
It isn't here.

00:27:00.953 --> 00:27:02.204
So, start baseball again.

00:27:04.081 --> 00:27:05.290
Even if I do, I'll fail.

00:27:06.959 --> 00:27:07.960
It's already too late.

00:27:16.343 --> 00:27:18.095
An unsuccessful baseball player

00:27:19.179 --> 00:27:21.306
is better than an unsuccessful gangster.

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:24.101
So, go and do what you used to like.

00:27:25.686 --> 00:27:28.564
The guys in there? Me?

00:27:28.647 --> 00:27:30.399
We have nothing left to even fail at.

00:27:34.528 --> 00:27:35.529
Get up.

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:42.411
Go.

00:27:43.787 --> 00:27:45.831
Go and try again.

00:27:47.124 --> 00:27:50.043
And if you think
it's really not going to work,

00:27:50.127 --> 00:27:51.128
then come back.

00:28:40.886 --> 00:28:44.264
She's been going to that place
for a few days now.

00:28:44.973 --> 00:28:46.683
It's an agency for singers.

00:28:46.767 --> 00:28:50.562
Pathetically, she's going
here and there to become a real singer.

00:28:52.439 --> 00:28:55.359
Anyway, sir,
must I even follow Seokcheol's girlfriend?

00:29:01.531 --> 00:29:02.950
Have you always been this talkative?

00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:06.161
Then, I must've been wrong about you.

00:29:07.454 --> 00:29:09.831
No, sir. I apologize.

00:29:10.332 --> 00:29:12.417
What's the important news you have for me?

00:29:13.627 --> 00:29:14.628
Well...

00:29:15.379 --> 00:29:16.380
Sir.

00:29:19.174 --> 00:29:22.386
I didn't tell you this last time
because I wasn't sure,

00:29:24.262 --> 00:29:26.765
but I think you're being targeted
by my side.

00:29:32.062 --> 00:29:33.063
Me?

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:35.941
Who's after me?

00:29:37.943 --> 00:29:39.736
- Check the money.
- Yes, sir.

00:29:43.615 --> 00:29:45.283
It's been transferred, sir.

00:29:46.076 --> 00:29:49.579
Once you're done, the Chairman
will find you and reward you much more.

00:29:50.956 --> 00:29:52.290
- Thank you.
- You punk.

00:29:52.374 --> 00:29:54.126
You don't thank your family.

00:29:54.209 --> 00:29:56.628
I'll go in and meet the Chairman briefly.

00:29:56.712 --> 00:29:58.005
Wait here for a bit.

00:29:58.547 --> 00:29:59.631
- Yes, sir.
- See you.

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:34.708
Mr. Chairman.

00:30:40.338 --> 00:30:41.381
Where's Dusik?

00:30:42.007 --> 00:30:43.050
Outside, in the car.

00:30:43.133 --> 00:30:45.052
- Did you pay him?
- Yes.

00:30:46.553 --> 00:30:49.264
He used to steal from houses,
and nothing else.

00:30:49.347 --> 00:30:50.348
You think he can do it?

00:30:50.432 --> 00:30:52.309
Of course. He says he has experience.

00:30:54.603 --> 00:30:58.565
Tell him we'll have his back for sure
if he gets the job done.

00:30:58.648 --> 00:30:59.649
Yes, sir.

00:31:00.442 --> 00:31:01.443
Watch him closely.

00:31:02.402 --> 00:31:03.403
Sangyeol.

00:31:03.904 --> 00:31:07.699
He may change his mind,
so make him do it as soon as possible.

00:31:08.742 --> 00:31:09.951
Please don't worry.

00:31:56.832 --> 00:31:57.916
GAME START

00:32:20.647 --> 00:32:22.732
Now, think carefully before you answer.

00:32:24.734 --> 00:32:25.944
Who took the order?

00:32:27.696 --> 00:32:31.700
How far would you go
to show your loyalty to me?

00:32:32.325 --> 00:32:34.661
I'm not sure
what exactly you mean.

00:32:35.453 --> 00:32:37.122
Kang Taehoon, that rat.

00:32:37.998 --> 00:32:39.499
I want you to quietly end him.

00:32:42.502 --> 00:32:43.503
Seokcheol?

00:32:44.838 --> 00:32:46.047
Are you sure about this?

00:32:46.131 --> 00:32:48.508
Yes. I heard it myself.

00:33:26.129 --> 00:33:27.631
Hello, sir.

00:33:31.551 --> 00:33:33.386
- Welcome back, sir.
- Wait outside.

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:35.388
Cheonho, I need to talk to you.

00:33:35.889 --> 00:33:36.890
Yes, sir.

00:33:42.395 --> 00:33:43.396
Cheonho.

00:33:46.316 --> 00:33:48.443
Cheonho.

00:33:49.653 --> 00:33:51.655
Gather men who can hold their tongues.

00:34:04.251 --> 00:34:07.254
SEOKCHEOL

00:34:15.637 --> 00:34:17.097
How can you do this to me?

00:34:21.142 --> 00:34:22.769
You want me to go wild too?

00:35:20.702 --> 00:35:22.704
- What are you looking at?
- Hey.

00:35:23.747 --> 00:35:26.750
This drawing. She looks a lot like you.

00:35:28.335 --> 00:35:31.546
Then, you are this tree.

00:35:32.505 --> 00:35:33.548
A tree?

00:35:34.215 --> 00:35:36.593
- Am I too reserved?
- Mmm-mmm.

00:35:37.302 --> 00:35:38.803
You're very much like a tree.

00:35:40.347 --> 00:35:41.431
Listen.

00:35:42.474 --> 00:35:45.560
When I came back to this neighborhood,

00:35:45.644 --> 00:35:49.397
I found you staying here
like a sturdy tree.

00:35:49.898 --> 00:35:53.652
And you always give me
good things, like a tree.

00:35:54.194 --> 00:35:57.614
Whenever I need a place to rest or hide,

00:35:58.156 --> 00:36:00.700
you provide me a shade like a tree.

00:36:03.203 --> 00:36:04.371
So, you're like a tree.

00:36:05.163 --> 00:36:06.331
Thank you.

00:36:07.332 --> 00:36:10.627
I'll also provide you with shade

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:13.838
so you can get a good rest
whenever you need it.

00:36:15.757 --> 00:36:16.758
Thanks.

00:36:17.926 --> 00:36:18.927
My pleasure.

00:36:58.425 --> 00:37:04.597
♪ <i>I hope this love can become</i>
<i>a poem by my side ♪</i>

00:37:04.681 --> 00:37:09.894
♪ <i>You and me ♪</i>

00:37:13.106 --> 00:37:14.941
Miyoung, I love it.

00:37:17.277 --> 00:37:18.528
Gosh.

00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:24.451
Gosh, it feels like living.

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.619
Miyoung, you should have one too.

00:37:26.703 --> 00:37:28.079
Thank you.

00:37:30.498 --> 00:37:33.042
- So, does it need a lot of changes?
- Mmm-mmm.

00:37:33.126 --> 00:37:36.087
A bit more of a bossa nova vibe will do.

00:37:36.171 --> 00:37:38.089
- Ah.
- And the tempo should be a bit faster.

00:37:39.299 --> 00:37:40.508
Let's go with this vibe.

00:37:40.592 --> 00:37:42.969
Or an extended-play album
with a few more songs.

00:37:44.304 --> 00:37:45.638
Well...

00:37:45.722 --> 00:37:48.475
Do you perhaps have
other songs of your own?

00:37:48.558 --> 00:37:51.644
Something heartrending, you know.

00:37:52.395 --> 00:37:53.396
A ballad.

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:55.482
Oh, a ballad.

00:37:56.149 --> 00:37:57.901
Oh, there's one.

00:37:57.984 --> 00:37:59.277
But it's not

00:38:00.236 --> 00:38:01.654
complete yet.

00:38:01.738 --> 00:38:03.490
It's okay. Just show me how it goes.

00:38:03.573 --> 00:38:04.657
Well...

00:38:05.867 --> 00:38:06.868
This is...

00:38:09.537 --> 00:38:12.832
...about couples
who have sensed they'll break up.

00:38:12.916 --> 00:38:16.503
They sense a breakup
before they fall in love

00:38:16.586 --> 00:38:17.879
or before they even meet.

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:45.281
What the... That punk.

00:39:06.219 --> 00:39:07.220
Ah.

00:39:23.361 --> 00:39:26.531
Why isn't she picking up?

00:39:36.124 --> 00:39:37.709
Goodness.

00:39:37.792 --> 00:39:39.878
Gosh, thanks for driving.

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:49.304
- Is this her house?
- Yes.

00:39:49.387 --> 00:39:51.431
- I see.
- It's on the second floor.

00:39:55.143 --> 00:39:56.895
Pick up. Come on.

00:40:00.523 --> 00:40:01.733
BYEONGSOO

00:40:02.984 --> 00:40:03.985
What?

00:40:06.446 --> 00:40:07.447
Gosh.

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.867
- Hi, Byeongsoo.
- Seokkyung!

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:12.827
<i>- What's up?</i>
- Why...

00:40:12.911 --> 00:40:15.663
<i>- You should get out of there right now!</i>
- Come out now?

00:40:15.747 --> 00:40:17.707
No. Don't come out. Stay there.

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:19.375
<i>Why didn't you answer my calls?</i>

00:40:19.459 --> 00:40:21.628
Your mom is coming up right now.

00:40:21.711 --> 00:40:23.796
- What?
- Calm down. Calm down.

00:40:25.256 --> 00:40:28.134
Ah! It has a nice view.

00:40:28.217 --> 00:40:30.428
Hey, what do I do? Hold on.

00:40:30.511 --> 00:40:31.888
But it has no elevator.

00:40:31.971 --> 00:40:33.723
It's not good for old people.

00:40:33.806 --> 00:40:35.558
It's only the second floor.

00:40:35.642 --> 00:40:37.644
You're strong.
You can easily take the stairs.

00:40:38.937 --> 00:40:41.564
Buildings with elevators
are twice as expensive.

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:48.321
Byeongsoo, what do I do?

00:40:48.404 --> 00:40:51.199
Lock the doors, hide,
and pretend you aren't there.

00:40:51.282 --> 00:40:52.283
<i>- Hide?</i>
- Okay?

00:40:54.035 --> 00:40:55.703
Oh, my goodness.

00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:58.665
Is it not the right code?

00:40:58.748 --> 00:41:01.960
Gosh, Seokhee texted me the code.

00:41:13.554 --> 00:41:16.307
Gosh, it worked.

00:41:19.352 --> 00:41:20.353
Oh?

00:41:21.187 --> 00:41:22.480
It's clean here.

00:41:23.398 --> 00:41:25.149
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

00:41:25.233 --> 00:41:27.652
- It's nice and cozy.
- Right.

00:41:29.362 --> 00:41:33.700
It seems like she's living with someone.

00:41:33.783 --> 00:41:34.826
What?

00:41:36.911 --> 00:41:41.416
Oh. Her junior nurses
probably came and slept over.

00:41:41.499 --> 00:41:42.917
I don't think so.

00:41:43.001 --> 00:41:45.420
She's engaged to that doctor
she works with, right?

00:41:45.503 --> 00:41:47.714
Look. There are two pillows.

00:41:47.797 --> 00:41:50.591
No, they haven't gone that far yet.

00:41:50.675 --> 00:41:52.427
Who knows?

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:55.513
People these days easily make love
if they like each other.

00:41:56.097 --> 00:41:57.098
Not my daughter!

00:41:59.225 --> 00:42:01.602
Anyway, where's the bathroom?

00:42:01.686 --> 00:42:03.146
Over there.

00:42:03.855 --> 00:42:04.856
The bathroom?

00:42:07.108 --> 00:42:08.776
Wait. The door won't open.

00:42:09.444 --> 00:42:10.987
It won't?

00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:15.074
I think it's locked from the inside.

00:42:17.118 --> 00:42:18.536
It can't be.

00:42:20.038 --> 00:42:22.540
What the...
What's wrong with this? What...

00:42:22.623 --> 00:42:24.917
I think someone's inside.

00:42:25.001 --> 00:42:28.296
This is bad. I really need to go.

00:42:28.379 --> 00:42:31.049
It's not like we can break the door open.
What do we do?

00:42:31.132 --> 00:42:32.341
Maksoon.

00:42:32.425 --> 00:42:34.010
Should we ask next door?

00:42:34.093 --> 00:42:35.803
We don't even know them.

00:42:35.887 --> 00:42:37.680
I'm too shy to go at a stranger's place.

00:42:47.106 --> 00:42:48.775
You get something too.

00:42:53.071 --> 00:42:55.656
Hey, you in the bathroom.
Who are you?

00:42:56.199 --> 00:42:59.202
Come out with your hands up,
or we'll break the door open.

00:43:00.661 --> 00:43:01.662
One,

00:43:02.288 --> 00:43:03.706
two...

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:04.957
You won't come out?

00:43:06.209 --> 00:43:07.627
I'm coming out.

00:43:19.514 --> 00:43:20.515
Mom.

00:43:27.563 --> 00:43:28.689
What were you doing in there?

00:43:29.315 --> 00:43:30.566
Things happened.

00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:33.319
What on earth? Is it you, Seokkyung?

00:43:33.402 --> 00:43:34.946
How have you been, ma'am?

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.741
You little rascal!

00:43:39.325 --> 00:43:40.868
MYOUNGSAN INDUSTRIES

00:43:58.636 --> 00:43:59.637
What's up?

00:44:02.765 --> 00:44:05.309
What's wrong with a mom
visiting her daughter's house?

00:44:06.144 --> 00:44:08.187
Hey, wait.

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:11.482
- Then, Seokhee--
- That's right, you punk!

00:44:11.566 --> 00:44:14.110
I was so flustered
that I couldn't do anything.

00:44:14.193 --> 00:44:16.279
- Hey, well... Okay.
- Calm down.

00:44:16.362 --> 00:44:18.489
- Let's hang up. All right, you punk.
- Seokcheol.

00:44:18.573 --> 00:44:20.158
Damn it.

00:44:23.035 --> 00:44:24.036
Hey.

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:26.664
<i>Do you know that Mom's at your place?</i>

00:44:26.747 --> 00:44:28.499
<i>- Seokkyung got caught.</i>
- I know.

00:44:29.917 --> 00:44:31.294
- You know?
- Yes.

00:44:31.377 --> 00:44:33.671
I made her go.
And I gave her the door code.

00:44:35.047 --> 00:44:36.507
- Hey, Seokhee.
<i>- What?</i>

00:44:36.591 --> 00:44:39.135
We should send her home.

00:44:39.218 --> 00:44:41.137
We can't let her leech off me forever.

00:44:42.847 --> 00:44:44.807
<i>- Those who must go, should go.</i>

00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:46.350
Right.

00:44:46.934 --> 00:44:48.060
You're right.

00:44:48.144 --> 00:44:50.062
Leave her be. It's her fate.

00:44:50.688 --> 00:44:51.689
I'm hanging up.

00:44:54.692 --> 00:44:55.693
Oh, boy.

00:44:56.235 --> 00:44:57.778
Whatever. I don't care.

00:45:01.532 --> 00:45:04.702
I'm not an informant or consultant.
Why do people keep calling me?

00:45:04.785 --> 00:45:05.828
Hello, sir.

00:45:05.912 --> 00:45:07.330
Seokcheol, where are you?

00:45:07.413 --> 00:45:10.374
- At the entrance, I was about to go up.
<i>- We have to find Dusik.</i>

00:45:10.458 --> 00:45:11.500
What?

00:45:12.168 --> 00:45:13.836
- What...
<i>- That punk, Dusik,</i>

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.671
<i>ran off with the Chairman's money.</i>

00:45:15.755 --> 00:45:17.715
Find him now. Okay?

00:45:17.798 --> 00:45:19.050
<i>Find him immediately.</i>

00:45:19.133 --> 00:45:20.593
Hello?

00:45:24.722 --> 00:45:26.599
What's happening now?

00:45:32.313 --> 00:45:33.898
Since when have you been hiding here?

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:39.528
Tell me. You're good with your words.

00:45:40.821 --> 00:45:43.741
Have you no shame?

00:45:44.659 --> 00:45:47.119
Aren't you ashamed
of leeching off your younger sister?

00:45:48.204 --> 00:45:50.748
I'm not ashamed.

00:45:52.458 --> 00:45:53.626
Life is just tough.

00:45:53.709 --> 00:45:55.670
Watch what you say to your mother.

00:45:56.545 --> 00:45:58.756
So, what makes your life that tough?

00:45:59.423 --> 00:46:00.841
It's too hard

00:46:01.801 --> 00:46:02.843
to make

00:46:03.594 --> 00:46:04.595
a living.

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:08.307
I bet.

00:46:08.391 --> 00:46:10.768
Because you're a runaway
who did something wrong.

00:46:10.851 --> 00:46:11.852
Mom.

00:46:12.478 --> 00:46:14.230
I missed you so much every night--

00:46:14.313 --> 00:46:16.357
Shut up.

00:46:17.316 --> 00:46:19.443
Because of the debt you left us with,

00:46:19.527 --> 00:46:21.654
your father and Seokcheol
are struggling so much

00:46:21.737 --> 00:46:23.781
to borrow money here and there.

00:46:24.573 --> 00:46:28.494
Your brother, Seokcheol,
even saved someone from a burning house.

00:46:30.663 --> 00:46:31.956
You little...

00:46:33.749 --> 00:46:34.834
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:46:36.085 --> 00:46:38.337
I'm sorry to Father, too.

00:46:41.424 --> 00:46:44.218
Maksoon, aren't you hungry?

00:46:44.302 --> 00:46:45.511
Check the rice cooker!

00:46:48.597 --> 00:46:49.765
It's empty.

00:46:51.267 --> 00:46:52.476
Should I make ramyeon for you?

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.895
Forget it, you punk.
Don't you move an inch.

00:46:54.979 --> 00:46:57.148
There are many packets of ramyeon.

00:46:57.231 --> 00:47:00.359
- I'll boil water first.
- Okay.

00:47:00.901 --> 00:47:01.902
Two packets?

00:47:08.826 --> 00:47:09.827
Make it three.

00:47:10.411 --> 00:47:12.246
Okay, three.

00:47:12.997 --> 00:47:16.417
Mom, I missed you.

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:19.295
Gosh, the back of your hand
has become so rough.

00:47:19.378 --> 00:47:20.379
It breaks my heart.

00:47:23.049 --> 00:47:25.217
Get off of me. It's gross.

00:48:01.879 --> 00:48:03.047
- Hello, sir.
- Hi.

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:05.174
- Hello, sir.
- Hi.

00:48:05.257 --> 00:48:06.550
Sir, Dusik...

00:48:06.634 --> 00:48:08.719
Yes, I heard. What's going on?

00:48:08.803 --> 00:48:10.346
I'm not so sure.

00:48:10.429 --> 00:48:12.139
Younggi is mad, too.

00:48:13.182 --> 00:48:14.225
Why?

00:48:14.308 --> 00:48:16.727
I think Dusik borrowed money
from him, too.

00:48:16.811 --> 00:48:19.146
He stormed out with a weapon to kill him.

00:48:19.605 --> 00:48:21.482
Please help get things under control.

00:48:22.149 --> 00:48:27.488
All right. Text the boys
to contact me as soon as they find Dusik.

00:48:27.571 --> 00:48:28.572
Yes, sir.

00:48:28.656 --> 00:48:30.866
That mess earlier, and now this. Tsk!

00:48:35.246 --> 00:48:36.247
Search the place.

00:48:38.666 --> 00:48:39.750
Damn it.

00:48:45.631 --> 00:48:46.882
- He's not here?
- No.

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:49.510
That rat.

00:48:50.803 --> 00:48:51.887
Search there too!

00:49:25.671 --> 00:49:27.006
DR. JANG KIHONG

00:49:27.089 --> 00:49:30.176
<i>If it were the past,</i>
<i>I would've told you every detail</i>

00:49:30.259 --> 00:49:32.052
<i>and left no misunderstanding like this.</i>

00:49:32.136 --> 00:49:34.638
<i>I love you. And this won't change.</i>

00:49:34.722 --> 00:49:36.974
<i>Please believe me.</i>
<i>You've got to believe me.</i>

00:49:37.683 --> 00:49:39.727
<i>I only half believe you.</i>

00:49:41.812 --> 00:49:42.980
Tsk!

00:50:05.961 --> 00:50:07.546
I'm home.

00:50:10.758 --> 00:50:12.676
What are you doing? Drinking?

00:50:14.595 --> 00:50:16.096
Seokhee.

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.390
- What?
- Come sit down.

00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:23.979
What? Do you feel lonely drinking alone?

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:25.981
Yes.

00:50:26.565 --> 00:50:30.444
My life is lonely, empty, and complicated.

00:50:31.028 --> 00:50:32.279
It's so confusing.

00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:39.662
Did something happen?
Why drink without any food?

00:50:40.829 --> 00:50:41.997
Don't look so surprised.

00:50:43.082 --> 00:50:44.375
Mom came by.

00:50:44.458 --> 00:50:46.001
Really?

00:50:46.085 --> 00:50:47.711
No way. Here?

00:50:48.087 --> 00:50:49.088
When you were alone?

00:50:50.172 --> 00:50:53.175
She came to clean and do the laundry,
and caught me.

00:50:53.259 --> 00:50:54.260
My gosh.

00:50:54.343 --> 00:50:55.761
Oh, dear.

00:50:55.844 --> 00:50:57.805
So, what did she say?

00:50:58.264 --> 00:50:59.807
She said, "How could you?"

00:51:00.599 --> 00:51:04.144
She got all worked up,
saying we deceived her.

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:06.897
Didn't she tell you
to follow her home right away?

00:51:12.319 --> 00:51:13.320
She didn't.

00:51:14.405 --> 00:51:17.741
She told me to stay hiding here
with you forever.

00:51:17.825 --> 00:51:19.451
What? Really?

00:51:22.997 --> 00:51:24.498
- Hey.
- What?

00:51:24.582 --> 00:51:28.085
Since we were kids,
you've always been foolish around me

00:51:28.168 --> 00:51:30.087
even if you acted all smart around others.

00:51:31.171 --> 00:51:32.172
You know what?

00:51:32.756 --> 00:51:34.800
This is why you can't be my match.

00:51:36.051 --> 00:51:37.511
- What?
- When you lie,

00:51:38.262 --> 00:51:40.848
it shows on your face.

00:51:40.931 --> 00:51:43.726
That's your biggest weakness, you punk.

00:51:46.562 --> 00:51:48.188
You gave her the door code, didn't you?

00:51:49.064 --> 00:51:50.524
You asked her to do the laundry!

00:51:51.066 --> 00:51:53.152
- No.
- I know you did!

00:51:53.235 --> 00:51:55.404
The circumstances tell me
you're behind it.

00:51:55.487 --> 00:51:56.780
- Come over here.
- Ahhh!

00:51:56.864 --> 00:51:58.949
- Let go. I said let go.
- Come here, you punk.

00:51:59.033 --> 00:52:03.704
How could you do this to me?

00:52:03.787 --> 00:52:05.998
This wouldn't have happened
had you gone back home.

00:52:06.081 --> 00:52:07.708
It's not that I didn't want to.

00:52:08.375 --> 00:52:11.128
I said I was too scared of Father
to go back home!

00:52:11.211 --> 00:52:12.588
You're that scared of him?

00:52:12.671 --> 00:52:14.882
Then how did you take out the loan
so fearlessly?

00:52:14.965 --> 00:52:17.426
Find that same courage to go home.
It'll be a piece of cake.

00:52:18.177 --> 00:52:21.013
Hey! That's up to me to decide!

00:52:21.096 --> 00:52:22.598
How do you expect to do that?

00:52:23.182 --> 00:52:25.100
You said you wanted to be
a car pawnbroker.

00:52:25.184 --> 00:52:27.019
That this house was like jail.

00:52:27.102 --> 00:52:28.228
I...

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:32.524
called Mom on purpose
in case you'd break out of jail.

00:52:54.088 --> 00:52:55.756
Goodness.

00:53:01.929 --> 00:53:02.930
Yes, sir.

00:53:06.934 --> 00:53:08.227
Damn it.

00:53:17.653 --> 00:53:20.239
Sir,
there's a place you should check.

00:53:23.867 --> 00:53:25.119
Is this it?

00:53:26.203 --> 00:53:27.287
Hello, sir.

00:53:30.165 --> 00:53:32.167
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Seokcheol.</i>

00:53:32.251 --> 00:53:33.627
<i>I guess this is just how I am.</i>

00:53:35.629 --> 00:53:37.715
You found this in Dusik's cabinet?

00:53:37.798 --> 00:53:39.258
Yes, and...

00:53:41.218 --> 00:53:42.261
What is it?

00:53:59.319 --> 00:54:00.612
Damn it.

00:54:00.696 --> 00:54:02.156
Sir, where are you going?

00:54:10.372 --> 00:54:12.374
This is why I told you to...

00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:21.550
Let's talk again later.

00:54:21.633 --> 00:54:23.218
Why was this in Dusik's locker?

00:54:23.969 --> 00:54:25.721
Don't change the subject.

00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:27.848
Did you give it to him?

00:54:27.931 --> 00:54:31.018
That punk can't even kill a bug.

00:54:31.101 --> 00:54:32.102
Hey.

00:54:32.686 --> 00:54:36.482
It was the Chairman's order.
We needed someone to do the job.

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:38.192
You said no.

00:54:39.026 --> 00:54:41.361
We've got to catch him soon.

00:54:41.445 --> 00:54:43.906
Otherwise, the Chairman will kill me.

00:54:43.989 --> 00:54:46.825
- Whatever. Clean up your mess yourself.
- Wait, Seokcheol!

00:54:46.909 --> 00:54:50.496
Fine. If you find him,
I'll give you the money you asked.

00:54:50.996 --> 00:54:53.290
It's an easy request.
Just find him for me.

00:54:53.373 --> 00:54:54.374
Damn it!

00:54:54.458 --> 00:54:57.628
If I have to take out a loan for you,
I will, you little punk.

00:54:58.962 --> 00:55:00.047
Seokcheol!

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:01.798
You said you needed money!

00:55:02.466 --> 00:55:03.467
Seokcheol!

00:55:26.949 --> 00:55:28.951
What...

00:55:31.912 --> 00:55:32.996
The key's here.

00:55:44.675 --> 00:55:45.968
Jeez!

00:55:54.768 --> 00:55:56.103
Damn it!

00:56:16.081 --> 00:56:17.207
Damn it.

00:56:20.711 --> 00:56:21.753
Taxi.

00:56:21.837 --> 00:56:23.338
Goodness.

00:56:25.966 --> 00:56:26.967
Gosh.

00:57:07.299 --> 00:57:08.467
Stop the music.

00:57:10.552 --> 00:57:12.679
- Miyoung. That was nice...
- Okay.

00:57:12.763 --> 00:57:15.265
...but why don't we go again
from the 17th bar where it goes,

00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:16.892
"We're from the same place"?

00:57:16.975 --> 00:57:19.603
- With a slightly more fluttery vibe.
- Okay.

00:57:20.145 --> 00:57:21.146
Begin.

00:57:32.032 --> 00:57:33.325
Hello, sir.

00:57:33.408 --> 00:57:34.743
Keep working.

00:57:36.453 --> 00:57:37.954
- Is she the one?
- Yes.

00:57:39.915 --> 00:57:41.458
What on earth?

00:57:41.541 --> 00:57:44.628
I didn't expect much,
but she's actually good.

00:57:44.711 --> 00:57:46.296
I like her vibe.

00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:49.591
Didn't you recommend her?
That's what I heard.

00:57:49.675 --> 00:57:53.387
No. It was a request from my acquaintance.

00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:56.139
I was going to help her
release just one album,

00:57:56.682 --> 00:57:59.267
but that might be a shame for us.

00:57:59.851 --> 00:58:03.105
Right. She's got enough potential.

00:58:15.325 --> 00:58:16.618
Gosh, sir.

00:58:16.702 --> 00:58:18.078
Goodness.

00:58:18.578 --> 00:58:20.497
I really like this one.

00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:22.249
- You like her?
- Yes.

00:58:22.332 --> 00:58:25.168
- We're lucky to find someone like her.
- That's good.

00:59:10.213 --> 00:59:11.715
How did the talk go?

00:59:13.884 --> 00:59:16.928
The CEO seems to be very fond of you.

00:59:18.555 --> 00:59:19.931
It might work out.

00:59:20.015 --> 00:59:21.016
Good luck.

00:59:21.099 --> 00:59:22.642
What is going on here?

00:59:23.268 --> 00:59:25.270
I said I wanted to help you.

00:59:26.772 --> 00:59:29.733
An opportunity
doesn't always come by

00:59:29.816 --> 00:59:31.485
just because you try your best.

00:59:31.568 --> 00:59:33.737
The world doesn't work that way.

00:59:35.447 --> 00:59:40.035
I'll finalize the contract
to a degree that satisfies me.

00:59:40.786 --> 00:59:42.120
So, focus only on singing.

00:59:43.038 --> 00:59:44.831
Why don't we

00:59:46.124 --> 00:59:48.001
go talk over a cup of coffee?

00:59:49.628 --> 00:59:51.338
What do you want to hear from me?

00:59:52.547 --> 00:59:54.216
You want me to thank you?

00:59:54.883 --> 00:59:56.760
Is it fun
to play with someone else's life?

01:00:01.973 --> 01:00:05.352
I refuse to cater to your mood,
so go.

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:06.561
Miyoung, wait.

01:00:06.645 --> 01:00:07.646
- Let go.
- Wait.

01:00:07.729 --> 01:00:09.231
- Let go of me.
- Hear me out!

01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:13.443
Can't you stop pushing me away?

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:15.821
I also have a heart that breaks.

01:00:23.495 --> 01:00:24.579
Let go of her.
