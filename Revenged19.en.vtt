00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.960
(Adapted from the novel
"Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.920
(Episode 19, This Path
Might Be a Very Difficult One)

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.120
Da Wei.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.400
Be strong.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.960
You make a lot of money now.

00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:35.520
You can buy your mom
the best medicine.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.640
As long as your mom
has a good mentality,

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.640
living a few more years
won't be a problem.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.800
Why didn't Chi Cheng...

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.800
tell me?

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.760
Maybe he's worried about you.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.000
Or maybe he just doesn't know
how to tell you.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.960
There are a lot of patients
like that in our ward.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.360
The closest people to them
were the last to know.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.280
Xiao Shuai.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.960
Later, when the doctor comes out,

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.200
help me ask him for me.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.960
This isn't my profession.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.800
I'm afraid I'd miss something.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.080
Okay.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.080
No problem.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.520
Family members,
the patient is awake.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.520
When you go in, don't cry.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.840
Do you hear me?

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.480
Mom.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.320
You're so sick.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.120
Why didn't you tell me?

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.720
You kept it from me for so long.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.600
It's my fault too.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.680
I've been busy with my own stuff.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.520
Da Qiong.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.880
Don't blame Xiao Chi.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.560
I told him not to tell you.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.920
You have enough on your plate
to worry about.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.040
I really don't want you...

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.080
to worry about me.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.480
Mom.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.800
Technology is so advanced now.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.000
I'm sure you can be cured.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.040
I believe you.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Don't cry.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
That's enough.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.400
Don't.

00:04:16.401 --> 00:04:17.719
Mr. Chi.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.360
- Throw it.
- Don't panic.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.920
One, two, three, go.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.040
This is exciting.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.720
How is she, doctor?

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.640
All tests came back normal.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.080
Mrs. Wu.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.880
Hey, let's do it together.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.520
Mom.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.240
I'll give you a massage.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.360
Da Qiong.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.240
I'm a burden to you.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.240
You're not a burden.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.080
You must be exhausted, Da Qiong.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.040
Come in.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.440
Thank you, Xiao Shuai.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.800
You always come to visit my mom.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.520
Don't worry about it.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.440
I just got off work a little early.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.120
Besides,

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.920
my clinic is full of patients.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.160
They'll understand.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.880
Do you think...

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.119
my mom's condition...

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.920
Gosh, don't worry.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.639
Your mom's mentality...

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.640
is much better than when she was
just hospitalized.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.920
But I feel like she's a child.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.120
She can only fall asleep
if I coax her.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.760
Also,

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.440
once she falls asleep,
she always sleeps for a long time.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.720
Wu Suo Wei.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.360
Why are you here?

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.080
You guys talk.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.080
I'll stay with Mrs. Wu for a while.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.080
Okay.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.600
I heard about your mom.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.360
I...

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.800
have a friend in the US...

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.040
who specializes
in pancreatic tumors.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.560
I asked him to come
and check on her.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.520
He's probably
on the plane right now.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.960
He'll be here tomorrow.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.519
I came in advance...

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.320
to talk to you
and the attending physician.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.400
Thank you.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.400
Sorry for troubling you.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.800
Thank you.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.800
That's what friends are for.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.640
Look at yourself.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.560
You're not the one who got dumped.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.360
That's easy for you to say.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.880
The probability...

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.960
of this kind of thing
happening to me is zero.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.520
You've never dated.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.640
How could you get dumped?

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.920
And now, you're even
finding him a doctor.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.320
You don't even know
if he'll appreciate it.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.160
Right now,

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.600
you look like
the whole world has wronged you.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.200
It makes me look down on you.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.480
What right do you have
to look down on me?

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.640
Wang Zhen, I'm telling you.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.600
Don't be so arrogant every day.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.960
I've told you before.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.479
Mom doesn't want a son...

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.960
who doesn't
acknowledge his family like you.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.360
If I didn't pity you,

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.680
you'd be homeless now.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.320
What you're doing...

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.960
only proves that Chi Cheng
made the right choice.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.280
What... What do you know?

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.680
People like you...

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.400
won't understand me.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.280
Do you remember when we were kids?

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.400
We only had
one corn stick snack left that time.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.480
Mom told us to split it
and share it.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.040
You cried and screamed...

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.120
because you wanted
to eat the long piece.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.960
Mom had no choice
but to make the long piece shorter.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.600
In the end, the short piece
became the long piece.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.760
She had to keep breaking it.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.280
After so much breaking,

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.760
neither of us got to eat it
in the end.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.880
But you clapped your hands
happily instead.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:41.880
Because to you,

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.120
having it is more important
than enjoying it.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.640
You'd rather not eat it...

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.640
than eat less of it.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.560
You've changed today.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.000
You're talking so much.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.720
Green-Eyed Monster,
I got you a new home.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.200
I'll just put him in.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.800
Thank you, Wei Wei.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.360
Look, what's this called?

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.480
This...

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.440
should be...

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.760
my red bow tie.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.760
Right?

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.160
But the one you made
doesn't look like him.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.960
He isn't a cobra.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.800
That's venom.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.200
Tell me if it looks like him.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.880
Here.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.040
Be gentle.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.360
That muscle is tight.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.800
I'm a professional.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.520
Lower.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.400
How is it? Feels good, right?

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.160
Try my cooking.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.880
Can you cook?

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.440
Don't worry. My skill is similar
to Guo Cheng Yu's.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.200
Be careful, it's hot.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.160
Is it that bad?

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.960
Let's order takeout.
We'll order takeout, okay?

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.160
I'm thinking.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.840
The sunset is so beautiful.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.159
But the person with me...

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.720
didn't shave.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.720
I am full of hormones.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.480
I shaved this morning,

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.359
but it grew back now.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.360
You...

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.120
Green-Eyed Monster?

00:14:24.121 --> 00:14:25.601
He's just like
an inner demon at home.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:26.720
Let him stay with you.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:29.960
Why is he like an inner demon?

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Isn't he...

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.960
with Wang Shuo every day?

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.680
Snakes are also like humans.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.840
He sees you as family.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.360
To him, Wang Shuo
is just a companion.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.520
It's okay
if it's just for a few days.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:43.960
But if it's too long,

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.120
it absolutely won't work.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.960
It's been listless at home for days.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.200
I realized...

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.040
that listening to you talk
feels so good.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:56.800
You know what?

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.239
The expert you found for me...

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.600
is very useful.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.640
My mom has much more energy now.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.840
Thank you.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.679
Where did you buy this?

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.000
I loved it when I was little.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.440
Eat it.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.960
No, you can have it.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.120
I was waiting for you to say that.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.480
You're smarter
than Wang Shuo indeed.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.680
Give all this to your mom.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.200
I'm sure she'll love it.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.079
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.360
- I'll get going.
- Bye.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.080
Wu Suo Wei.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.760
What's the matter?

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.400
I'm leaving soon.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.840
I'll take Wang Shuo with me.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.240
- Will you still come back?
- I will.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.360
Okay.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.840
When you come back,
to teach me new kung fu.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Bye.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.280
You're stronger than Wang Shuo.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.520
Chi Cheng can give you...

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.040
your sense of security.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.120
But only I can give
the sense of security...

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.480
that Wang Shuo wants.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:25.920
Hurry up.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.400
I'm coming.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.440
Mr. Chi.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.320
Mr. Chi, aren't you coming in?

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.560
No.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.800
I'll wait for the next one.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:51.760
What are you doing?

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.760
You're finally willing
to come to your boyfriend.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.040
Wu Suo Wei just got dumped...

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.360
and his mom is very sick.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.640
I have to take care of him.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:01.920
So...

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.040
you can just ignore your boyfriend?

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.679
Aren't you afraid...

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.880
that I'll keep a secret lover
at home?

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.999
You'd keep a secret lover?

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.760
Who? Chi Cheng?

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.120
How did you know?

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.600
Cheng Yu is mine.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.480
You're not needed here.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.440
Get lost.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:30.560
Shuai Shuai.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.079
This idiot said his house
is too big.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.416
He feels lonely and cold by himself,

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.199
so he insists
on staying here with me.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.200
I'm not lying.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.200
How... How long
has he been living here?

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.920
I've been living here...

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.880
for as long as you were gone.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.800
Can you shut up?

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.600
Shuai Shuai.

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:50.120
- Shuai Shuai.
- Don't spoil him.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.480
Shuai Shuai.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.120
Can I spoil him with you around?

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.240
Cheng Yu, I'm having a hard time.
Can't you come and keep me company?

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.440
Come on.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Fine.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.600
Come on.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.040
Move.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.680
Your timing is so good.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.920
He went to work today.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.560
Then aren't you going to visit him?

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.240
I can't go all the time.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.319
It's not a big deal.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.640
Do you have to act like this?

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.320
If Jiang Xiao Shuai said
he never loved you,

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.480
how would you feel?

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
The two of us...

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.920
aren't as dramatic as you two.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.520
I am...

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.280
not as petty as you either.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.959
Even if Jiang Xiao Shuai
really says...

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.560
he doesn't love me anymore one day,

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.560
I'll still pursue him,

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:03.840
pamper him,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
and keep pestering him.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.960
I'll keep loving him...

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.720
until he falls in love
with me again.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.200
You're so darn cheap.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.600
Yes. A cheap jerk with a mouth.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.080
When something occurs
or happens to me,

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.040
I'll explain things clearly
and talk it out.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.400
Unlike you.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.800
You're here drinking...

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.760
and smoking.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.680
If he can figure things out,

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.640
he can do so on his own
without anyone's explanation.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.080
If he can't figure it out,

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.520
he would dwell on it...

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.400
and won't ask me.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.040
I remember,

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.200
back then,

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.080
didn't you dwell on things too?

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.600
How dare you bring that up?

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.640
You didn't explain things
to me back then either.

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.320
Darn it.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.239
Whatever you say, Chi Cheng.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.280
Come on. Let's drink.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.800
Cheng Yu.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.120
To be honest,

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.320
if our reconciliation
didn't calm me down a bit,

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.000
I really can't handle this.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.720
Come on.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:26.960
Let's play a game.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.800
Let's play Two Little Bees...

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.120
like we did back then.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.160
Come on.

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:32.760
Hurry up.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.400
- Two little bees,
- Two little bees,

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.976
- flying to the flower shrubs.
- Flying to the flower shrubs.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
- Flying to the left,
- Flying to the left,

00:21:40.001 --> 00:21:41.176
- flying to the right.
- Flying to the right.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.280
- Fly!
- Fly!

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.720
Shuai Shuai, are you free tonight?

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.000
Come to my place for dinner.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.320
Isn't Chi Cheng still there?

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.399
If he's there, I'm not coming.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.400
I have to go.

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.640
Should we think of a way
to lure Chi Cheng out for a while?

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.680
I've become
a freaking herbivore now.

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.120
What do you have in mind?

00:22:25.121 --> 00:22:26.360
Let's find him another guy.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.599
Ever since he was with Mr. Wu,
Chi Cheng's philandering habits...

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:29.680
have lessened.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.960
That's a good idea.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.000
I wonder
if he's in the mood for that now.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.520
Let's give it a try.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.880
Should we find a man or a woman?

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.000
A man or a woman?

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.480
It's up to you.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.800
Any requirements?

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.000
Big eyes.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:55.800
Try it.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.680
I just made this...

00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:58.960
for you this morning.

00:22:58.961 --> 00:23:00.000
I made it myself.

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.440
It looks, smells, and tastes good.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.840
Is there anyone else...

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.360
in the house besides you?

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:05.800
No.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.800
If you dare to lie to me,
I won't talk to you for a week.

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:13.760
You're so childish.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.200
How can you still say
that kind of thing at your age?

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.480
You must be hungry.
Eat something first, okay?

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.280
I'll feed you.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.440
Try it.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.200
Guo Cheng Yu.

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:01.280
What is this?

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.200
This... This isn't a person.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.800
Right?

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.680
There are a lot of people
in your house, right?

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.160
Chi Cheng...

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.600
is not considered a person too.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:18.919
If you want to play, go inside.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.920
Why did you come out?

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.040
Her eyes are too big.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:28.800
I feel scared,

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.320
dude.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.840
Xiao Shuai.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.560
Guo Cheng Yu, you...

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.320
- You two...
- Carry on.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.760
Don't mind me.
I'm not considered a person.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.280
Xiao Shuai, I can explain.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.320
The three of you
can enjoy yourselves.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.359
I don't want to talk
to you for a week.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.360
Don't.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.000
A week is too much.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.400
Half a day.

00:24:51.401 --> 00:24:53.120
- A day at most, okay?
- No!

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.320
Darn you.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.920
Shuai Shuai.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.680
Shuai Shuai.

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.280
Didn't you go
to Guo Cheng Yu's place?

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:15.680
Why are you here?

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.080
Right now,

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.040
Chi Cheng is staying
at his place too.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:23.840
He doesn't need me.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Da Wei.

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.400
You really don't mind?

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.080
Why should I care?

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.679
You're the one
who should be jealous.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.360
You're madly in love
with Guo Cheng Yu now.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.000
You don't want anyone
to get in your way.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.160
That's very normal.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.440
Are you planning to continue being
like this with Chi Cheng forever?

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.600
By the way,

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:52.880
I'm curious.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.199
Why did Yue Yue
disappear without a trace...

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.680
after coming to me once?

00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.400
What do you mean?

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:01.600
I'm just wondering.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.320
She only showed up twice,

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.200
then she completely disappeared.

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.279
I've been asking around about her,

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.760
but I haven't heard anything.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.720
She must have done something bad
and went into hiding.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.920
But since she suddenly appeared
at that point in time,

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.280
someone must have
instructed her to do it.

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.080
Also,

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.280
the person who's helping her hide...

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.440
is quite capable.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.759
The person who's helping her
do bad things...

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.400
must be really good.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.440
Who are you talking about?

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.640
Isn't it obvious?

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.159
Aside from Wang Shuo,

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.160
who else can it be?

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.840
Green-Eyed Monster.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.759
Mr. Wu, take a look at this.

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.439
Xiao Lin, did you come
into the office earlier?

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.760
Did you see a big box here?

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.920
I left a document here
this morning, then I...

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.120
The cleaning lady was here.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.999
She did seem to be holding
a box this big.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.080
It looked quite heavy.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.959
She said
she was throwing it away as scrap.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:11.960
What?

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.400
- Move.
- What's wrong, Mr. Wu?

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.040
Mr. Wu.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Mr. Wu.

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:24.560
Let me do it.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000
I found it.

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:58.840
I'm sorry, Mr. Wu.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.599
I really didn't know your office...

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.160
- That scared me.
- Had this.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.400
Are you alone today?

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:26.880
Where's Xiao Wu?

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.400
You still remember him?

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.080
Yes. Of course I remember
a customer like Xiao Wu.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.400
Go get some food first.

00:28:34.401 --> 00:28:35.761
- I'll let you get to work.
- Okay.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.680
Miss.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.920
- I'm done.
- Okay.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.640
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.120
Here's yours.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.640
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.160
The spicy hot pot you ordered
is really different from Xiao Wu's.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.216
Every time he comes,
he doesn't just take anything.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.719
Vegetarian food and meat dishes.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.960
He weighs them as he goes.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.360
He controls the price precisely.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Yes.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:54.600
He's a cheapskate.

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.280
Enjoy your meal.

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.960
(Store for lease)

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.400
Miss.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.400
Are you closing your shop?

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.840
We're closing down.
Business is getting worse.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.400
When I came here before,

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.560
wasn't business good?

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.520
That was a long time ago.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.040
Look at the market now.

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:25.440
Everything has changed.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.280
Take your time eating.

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.520
Mom, let me wipe your feet.

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.560
After washing your feet,
get some rest.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.360
All right. I'll help you to bed.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:04.560
Xiao Chi.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.640
Come here.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.680
Mrs. Wu.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.200
I'm here.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.280
I'm here.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.440
I...

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.400
I...

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.400
I know.

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.280
I understand...

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.760
you two.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:27.360
Mrs. Wu.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.000
I'm sorry.

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.160
I didn't hear you.

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:31.760
Say it again.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:33.960
Repeat it.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.280
I...

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.200
I am...

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.440
I'm just afraid...

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.840
for you two.

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.120
This path...

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:54.920
might...

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.480
It might be...

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.800
a very difficult one.

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.360
Mrs. Wu.

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.280
Mrs. Wu.

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.920
It's okay.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.600
You'll be fine.

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.280
You and him...

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.640
should be good together.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:37.560
Mrs. Wu.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.400
Mom.

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.120
Da Qiong.

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:10.840
I...

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.280
I want...

00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.520
to go home.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.040
Mom.

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:20.640
The doctor said
all indicators aren't stable yet.

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:23.640
It's not recommended
to get discharged.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.720
I've been here long enough.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:31.000
I... I want to go home.

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:32.960
Da Qiong.

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.360
- Okay.
- Take...

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.640
Take me home.

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:39.720
Mom, let's go home.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.080
- Mom.
- Give it to me.

00:34:57.081 --> 00:34:58.119
I'll cook for you.

00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.319
There's no need.

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.320
Today, I'll cook for you.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.560
Mom, don't bother.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:04.960
Get some rest.

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:08.279
Today, I feel very energetic.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.720
I'm in good condition.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:10.800
All right.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.200
Go to your room and rest.

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.279
There's no need, Mom.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.200
- I'll stay here with you.
- Okay.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:29.920
Look.

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.520
This flower is growing so well.

00:35:58.840 --> 00:35:59.840
Here, Mom.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:00.920
Have some soup.

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:13.160
Da Qiong.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.240
When are you...

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.640
going to get me a daughter-in-law?

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.160
Soon.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.600
Xiao Chi must be very busy lately.

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.400
He...

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.040
is quite busy.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.400
Xiao Chi is a good person.

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:55.880
He's nice.

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:22.920
Mom.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:24.840
Mom.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.440
Let's eat.

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.480
Okay.

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:13.440
Mom.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.200
Why are you sleeping here?

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.920
Let's go.
I'll help you to your room.

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.160
Mom.

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.880
Look at you.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:21.600
It's summer...

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.560
and you're sleeping in the yard.

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:25.600
What if it's winter?

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.080
I can't be with you all the time.

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.760
If you have a headache or a fever,

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:35.920
I can't take care of you.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:40.840
Mom.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.600
Why don't I buy a house nearby?

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:49.680
You can move in with me...

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:51.840
and I can take care of you.

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.440
You always say it's a blessing
to suffer losses.

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.480
It's good to live a peaceful life.

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.200
Mom.

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.360
Actually, I never told you...

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.320
that I started a company.

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.160
I didn't want you to worry about me,

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:31.640
so I didn't dare to tell you.

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.120
You won't blame me, right?

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.280
Actually, I deserve to be blamed.

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:52.640
I'm unfilial.

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.280
I didn't give you a good life.

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:37.560
Mom.

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:40.960
I'm sorry.

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:44.720
I lied to you again.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.200
I don't think...

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.960
I'd ever get a wife
in this lifetime.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:16.560
Mom.

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:20.920
Mom.

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:23.800
Don't go.

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:35.080
Mom.
